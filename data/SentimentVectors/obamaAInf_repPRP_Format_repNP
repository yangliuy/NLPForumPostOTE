1	3	Come on zero , take stance ... LOL .
3	3	Are you holding out for deal ?
4	5	I 'm not taking stance on 1\/4 of term .
5	5	When his ASPECT_TERM is over , I 'll give answer .
6	6	Would you vote for Palin ?
7	7	Start providing facts to back up HE ASPECT_STATEMENTS .
8	7	Even if are true , does n't mean he or are wrong ASPECT_, that conservatives do not agree .
9	8	Are you freakin ' ASPECT_NUTZ ?
10	8	Palin is BIMBO !
11	9	So you 'll take stance on Palin ... already made up your ASPECT_MIND ... but STANCE 's to early to take stance on Obama ???
12	9	's pretty funny ...
13	11	Why would you agree with of what I listed , assuming they are correct ?
14	12	was point I was proving .
15	12	Folks have no ASPECT_IDEA how Palin would do , yet FOLKS would not vote for her , but FOLKS still have n't made up ASPECT_FOLKS_MINDS about Obama , even though OBAMA has proven to be disaster .
17	13	Begin to soar ?
19	13	WE say NO because we know how Obama is trying to -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_WE .
20	14	No ASPECT_I would not .
21	14	And I know what you 're trying to do .
22	14	I vehemently disagree with her .
23	14	With Obama , I have to take of wait and see approach .
24	14	things I have liked and others I have n't , so I 'll wait .
25	15	I 'll vote for Obama over of Republicans now in field .
26	15	Obama has kept ASPECT_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN promises .
27	15	OBAMA has n't gotten everything through yet , but CAMPAIGN early in ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM .
28	15	I do n't watch Fox so I have no ASPECT_TROUBLE keeping up with what FOX doing ASPECT_.95 of Americans got ASPECT_TAX_CUT year and .
29	15	Does your ASPECT_95 include world ASPECT_OR ?
30	15	I do n't have problem with spending ; I know where PROBLEM 's going .
31	15	PROBLEM way too early to worry about deficit .
32	15	PEOPLE are n't people .
33	15	Obama was legitimately elected as was congress .
34	15	They 're doing what THEY said THEY 'd do while campaigning .
35	15	Obama has n't weakened security in way .
36	15	I do n't watch Fox so I know about ASPECT_TERRORIST_PLOTS were just thwarted .
37	15	Finally , Pakistan is going after ASPECT_AL_QAEDA on THEY ASPECT_SIDE of border .
38	15	's pretty big ASPECT_COUP .
39	15	FOX has neither proposed ASPECT_NOR passed legislature hurts Americans .
40	15	FOX has strengthened ties with traditional ASPECT_ALLIES .
41	15	FOX has stood up to enemies .
42	15	I am not aware of ASPECT_SINGLE_INSTANCE where Obama lied .
43	15	As far as BS goes , Obama is ASPECT_POLITICIAN_and ASPECT_ENEMIES suffer from that bit .
44	16	Actually if you notice , Sly already participated in poll ... so not so funny .
45	16	Instead fail on your ASPECT_PART .
46	18	Basically ASPECT_NONE of will or can happen .
47	19	So its safe ASPECT_BET I wo n't vote for man .
48	19	Just as I suspected .
49	20	Honestly I do n't know how you could possibly expect Congress or President to give up salary until American got job , which to I knowledge has never happened in history of country .
50	20	tells I your ASPECT_EXPECTATIONS are completely unreasonable .
51	21	You 're not worried about spending .
52	21	To early to worry about deficit .
53	21	Strengthened ASPECT_TIES with allies .
54	21	ASPECT_STOOD_UP to enemies .
55	21	Wow ... just ASPECT_WOW .
56	22	Obama has done pretty good ASPECT_JOB as President , so already your ASPECT_THREAD is big fat ASPECT_FAIL .
57	22	And , as far as going down as worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT surpassing Carter - I believe ASPECT_GEORGIE_BOY has already done that .
58	22	And , was ASPECT_RASMUSSEN_POLL -LRB- ASPECT_RIGHT-LEANING_POLL -RRB- - so , your second ASPECT_PRONOUNCEMENTS is also erroneous .
59	22	Do ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES ever get anything right ?

74	22	ASPECT_GEORGE_W._BUSH presidency appears headed for colossal ASPECT_HISTORICAL_DISGRACE .
75	22	Gee , conservatives expected BUSH to accomplish BUSH promises by ASPECT_JAN_21 , ASPECT_2009 , so of ASPECT_COURSE_CONSERVATIVES are disappointed .
76	22	More so than Bush .
77	22	Another ASPECT_LIE .
78	22	ANOTHER has not raised taxes .
79	22	To undo what ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH did - and it has helped .
80	22	We 'd be in depression if Republican was in office .
81	22	Never mind when Bush was doing DEPRESSION , at least Obama is doing DEPRESSION to help not help BUSH , like Bush .
82	22	Bwahaha , BWAHAHA ignores Party of No ASPECT_AND NO ASPECT_FOLLOWERS , uses tactics used by Republicans , which I guess FOLLOWERS have forgotten .
83	22	Another big fat ASPECT_LIE being propagated by GOP .
84	22	Another big fat ASPECT_LIE .
85	22	BWAHAHA has done more for world ASPECT_PEACE than ASPECT_BOZO_, ASPECT_WAR_MONGER_BUSH ever did .
86	22	We had enemies because of Bush .
87	22	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY_and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_COHORTS , i.e. Fox ASPECT_NEWS , ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , Limbaugh and motley ASPECT_CREW at Faux ASPECT_NEWS are ones spewing lies .
88	22	Hell yes , ten ASPECT_TIMES over ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CLOWN GOP puts up .
89	23	from did n't worry about Bush spending , or fact that Bush had surplus and blew ASPECT_SPENDING and handed Obama deficit .
90	23	And yes , Obama has strengthened ties with allies and stoop up to enemies , fact that you are are n't aware of YES is because OBAMA does YES with ASPECT_FINESSE_, ASPECT_NOT like buffoon had before .
91	23	i.e. ASPECT_BUSH = `` I.E. 'm Decider !
92	24	Obama approval ASPECT_RATING is 47 .
93	24	OBAMA ASPECT_TERM_AVERAGE is 57 average for ASPECT_US_PRESIDENTS -LRB- since FDR -RRB- is 55 , so OBAMA is doing better than .
94	24	Your beloved ASPECT_REAGAN had 44 at time in office as Obama .
95	24	-LRB- So Obama is doing better -RRB- .
96	24	Maybe you should open your ASPECT_EYES .
97	24	What is dangerous for America is GOP with AMERICA ASPECT_WHACKOS .
98	24	Beginning with ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , ASPECT_MICHELE_BACHMANN , ASPECT_TEA_BAGGERS and who have advocated violence , who makes inciting comments like `` Do n't retreat - reload and `` time YOU 'll come armed .
99	24	What bunch of uncivilized ASPECT_NITWITS .
100	24	Who are you that US should worry about being penalized ?
101	25	Not really .
102	25	salaries are stipend .
103	25	STIPEND about power .
104	26	Your ASPECT_ANSWERS are that of ASPECT_TYPICAL_blind ASPECT_OBAMA_SHEEP .
105	26	OBAMA will be worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
106	26	OBAMA will not keep ASPECT_OBAMA_PROMISE about ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for 95 of Americans .
107	26	OBAMA ASPECT_HCR_BILL is proof of .
108	26	OBAMA wants VAT for Christ sake .
109	26	What do you think is ?
110	26	ASPECT_OBAMA_DOHS has stopped enforcing ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_LAWS .
111	26	They have tied hands of ASPECT_LOCAL_LAW_ENFORCEMENT_AGENCIES in seeking illegal ASPECT_ALIENS .
112	26	DOHS has cut ASPECT_BORDER_AGENTS .
113	26	DOHS has weakened ASPECT_BORDER_SECURITY , thus , or ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY .
114	26	Cap & ASPECT_TAX is next , then amnesty .
115	26	Destructive for America .
116	26	None of what I said are lies .
117	26	You will see .
118	27	Obama is on OBAMA ASPECT_WAY down .
119	27	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_FOLKS are Americans of walks of life .
120	27	Open your ASPECT_EYES .
121	27	FOLKS have not advocated violence - you lie there .
122	28	He has , in fact , already signed 640 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_TAX_HIKES , 14 of which violate HE promise to 95 of Americans .

124	29	How can I take stance whenever he has pleased and disappointed I at time ?
125	29	Perhaps it is easier for you because situation is black and white -- with ASPECT_'D_' next to HE name , your ASPECT_MIND was decided .
126	31	I do n't care what ASPECT_LETTER he has next to HE name .
127	31	HE is utter ASPECT_FAILURE and fraud .
128	32	So is how conservatives vote ?
129	32	Wondering how would do ?
130	32	Interesting , no ASPECT_WONDER voted in Bush .
131	32	Palin has already proven herself to not know much .
132	32	Why would with brain consider HERSELF `` just to see how HERSELF would do ?
133	32	HERSELF would totally destroy country , is how HERSELF would do .
134	32	Obama is doing fine .
135	32	ones finding fault with things OBAMA is doing are neo-cons , right-wing , ASPECT_TEA_BAGGERS , not much to consider .
136	32	Palin criticized Obama for ASPECT_OBAMA_STANCE on reducing ASPECT_NUCLEAR_WEAPONS .
137	32	Did she even bother to check Reagan was trying to do ?
138	32	So , Reagan , your ASPECT_IDOL was right , but Obama is wrong ?
139	32	Bwahaha - just goes to show conservatives do n't know much about anything except complaining .
140	33	Of ASPECT_COURSE_NOT , is why poster claimed they would vote for Obama .
141	33	All right-wingers can do is whine and cry and belly-ache , because THEY are not in power .
142	33	I wonder if BELLY-ACHE would require of Rep ?
143	33	I wonder if Rep would even consider of ASPECT_REP_REQUESTS ?
145	34	Not to mention insane !
146	35	said from whose ASPECT_POSTS exhibit ASPECT_OVINE_BEHAVIOR - BAAAAAAAA !
147	35	doubt that will topple Bush out of position .
148	35	HCR is best could have happened to country .
149	35	As is refined , and ASPECT_PEOPLE -LRB- except ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_SHEEP -RRB- will be able to see and Obama will get credit OBAMA deserves .
150	35	is time for right to quit trying to control what Obama does or does n't do , you had your ASPECT_CHANCE and you blew , with Bush .
151	35	sing-song sung by right .
152	35	Enough with ASPECT_RACIAL_PROFILING , ASPECT_FENCE_BUILDING and ASPECT_NON-SENSICAL_METHODS applied by right .
153	35	There are ways to destroy America , and would be to hand control over to right .
154	35	Bush did n't have cap & ASPECT_TRADE and BUSH nearly destroyed US .
155	35	Well , being that you have already been proven wrong -LRB- you said Obama had not been able to do anything OBAMA promised ASPECT_-RRB- , it is hard to believe anything right says .
156	37	Rove is liar .
157	37	It 's ROVE ever does .
158	38	You 've been saying that since ASPECT_JAN_21 , ASPECT_2009 !
159	38	His ASPECT_RATINGS are going up , so enough of your ASPECT_LIES .
160	38	As long as Palin and rest of conservatives keep denying REST , REST will continue .
161	38	I 'm sure ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES are aware of what is going on , but CONSERVATIVES play innocent ASPECT_CARD , and pretend that what CONSERVATIVES do does not incite violence .
162	38	Maybe you need to take your ASPECT_ADVICE and open `` your ASPECT_EYES .
163	38	In ASPECT_SUBSEQUENT_SEGMENT , titled DANGEROUS ASPECT_RHETORIC : When heated ASPECT_WORDS incite threats & ASPECT_VIOLENCE , CNN s panel agreed Obama s ASPECT_POLITICAL_OPPONENTS are inciting violence and are motivated by racism -- undeterred by Palin s assurance , which CNN played : When I talk about SEGMENT 's not time to retreat , SEGMENT time to reload , what I 'm talking about -- now , media , try to get right , ASPECT_OKAY ?
164	38	's not inciting violence .
165	38	What 's doing is trying to inspire people to get involved in ASPECT_PEOPLE_LOCAL_ELECTIONS and ASPECT_UPCOMING_FEDERAL_ELECTIONS .
166	38	SEGMENT telling ASPECT_PEOPLE that ASPECT_PEOPLE_ARMS are ASPECT_PEOPLE_VOTES .
167	38	SEGMENT 's not inciting violence .
168	38	SEGMENT telling ASPECT_PEOPLE , do n't ever let anybody tell you to sit down and shut up , Americans .
169	38	Lemon demanded : Is LEMON ASPECT_RESPONSIBLE for to say that ?
170	38	Especially leader , considering anger 's going on right now ?

172	38	If not violent , then just ASPECT_WHACKOS ?
173	38	Is n't just ASPECT_PLAIN_TREASON , and ignored by your ASPECT_PARTY .
174	38	Are kinds of idiots we need in military ?
175	38	In promoting ASPECT_ARMED_Forces ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_PATRIOTS , Stein has raised possibility of disobeying ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_ORDERS .
176	38	In one recent ASPECT_ONLINE_POSTING , STEIN wrote : I oath was to Constitution , not to politicians , and that oath will be kept .
177	38	I wo n't `` Just follow orders .
178	38	There is at time debate within ranks of ASPECT_MILITARY_regarding ASPECT_POLITICIANS_OATH .
179	38	mistakenly believe must follow order ASPECT_PRESIDENT_ISSUES .
180	38	But others do understand that ASPECT_OTHERS_LOYALTY is to Constitution and to people ... declaration echoes one made by ASPECT_OATH_KEEPERS , group of ASPECT_CURRENT_and ASPECT_FORMER_MILITARY_and ASPECT_LAW_ENFORCEMENT_PERSONNEL who havevowed not to follow orders deemed to be unconstitutional -- including orders to disarm Americans .
181	38	Stein agreed that two ASPECT_GROUPS are kindred spirits .
182	38	`` STEIN think GROUPS 're very like-minded with Oathkeepers , STEIN said .
183	38	`` STEIN strongly support Oathkeepers .
184	38	`` Stein ASPECT_POLITICAL_ACTIVISM seems to have raised concern among ASPECT_STEIN_SUPERIORS .
185	38	Late ASPECT_MONTH , STEIN wrote online : `` Was just told by ASPECT_MARINE_CORPS_OFFICER to watch what STEIN say about Obama ... STEIN think not ... And later ASPECT_DAY : `` STEIN was just told to keep ASPECT_STEIN_OPINONS -LRB- ASPECT_SIC_-RRB- to STEIN about Obama , by ASPECT_STEIN_OFFICER-IN-CHARGE -LRB- ASPECT_OIC_-RRB- .
186	38	`` Indeed , Stein may be violating ASPECT_MILITARY_POLICIES restrict ASPECT_POLITICAL_STATEMENTS_and ASPECT_ACTIVITIES by ASPECT_ACTIVE_DUTY_PERSONNEL .
187	38	`` LEBOWITZ 've seen ASPECT_MILITARY_COMMAND go against people on lot less , ASPECT_MIKE_LEBOWITZ , ASPECT_FORMER_JAG_LAWYER who 's expert on issues of ASPECT_MILITARY_EXPRESSION , told TPMmuckraker .
188	38	Lebowitz said one ASPECT_QUESTION is whether activity is judged to be `` partisan .
189	38	Though ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT has formed ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTIES in states , and has endorsed and supported candidates in races , there 's no ASPECT_EVIDENCE that Stein group has done so .
190	38	WASHINGTON -LRB- CBS\/AP -RRB- ASPECT_POLITICAL_PUNDITS knew ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM was going to upset critics and `` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY contingent , but PUNDITS probably did n't expect things to get violent .
191	38	ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_LEADERSHIP in Congress is decrying recent `` ASPECT_ACTS of violence against 10 ASPECT_HOUSE_DEMOCRATS and one ASPECT_REPUBLICAN , including one ASPECT_REPORT of ASPECT_CUT_GAS_LINE at house of brother of one ASPECT_MEMBER of Congress .
192	38	ASPECT_HOUSE_REPUBLICAN_LEADER_JOHN_BOEHNER , R-Ohio , says BOEHNER knows that people are angry but denounced disturbing ASPECT_TREND , saying , `` Threats and ASPECT_VIOLENCE should not be part of ASPECT_POLITICAL_DEBATE .
193	38	ASPECT_FORMER_GOVERNOR of Alaska ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN criticized media for ASPECT_CASTING_CBS\/AP_and ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_ACTIVISTS as violent .
195	39	Boy , do I agree with you .
196	39	Besides , fight up will be financial ASPECT_REGULATION , not cap and ASPECT_TRADE .
197	41	Evidence please , irrefutable ASPECT_EVIDENCE .
199	42	Let see how what ASPECT_AMERICA looks like in summer of 2012 .
200	43	Unless Jesus runs against JESUS , I will be voting for Obama in 2012 .
201	44	ASPECT_VALERIE_PLAME_SCANDAL .
202	44	By his ASPECT_WORDS too .
204	46	Bush did brilliantly in BUSH ASPECT_YEAR , and look how BUSH turned out .
205	46	years do not represent whole ASPECT_PRESIDENCY .
206	46	As for being penalized by you , golly .
207	46	I darn near quivered in I ASPECT_BOOTS .
208	47	If 's pretty funny , your ASPECT_SENSE of humor is pretty ASPECT_CRAP .
209	47	Try watching Daily ASPECT_SHOW .
210	47	Or maybe Borat .
211	47	SNL even .
212	48	I 'd rather have I eyes gouged out with ASPECT_CRAYONS and I insides ripped apart by feral ASPECT_RATS .
213	49	It sounds to YOU like his ASPECT_OPINION , and opinions do n't require evidencing .
214	49	Incidentally , are you currently living in Nigeria ?
215	49	`` Location : God greatest ASPECT_COUNTRY `` ASPECT_GOOGLE_SEARCH : God greatest ASPECT_NATION : http:\/\/www.nairaland.com\/nigeria\/topic-98070.0.html
216	50	I 'm guessing 's no. .
217	51	Hmm ... I suppose NO. might seem way but I actually quite enjoy whole ASPECT_CRAYON Yep , NO. no. .
218	51	who love America could never condemn her by voting for Sarahsquatch .
219	56	poll means little without opponent to choose from .
220	56	`` yes ASPECT_ANSWERS can become `` no , and `` no ASPECT_ANSWERS can become `` yes depending on catalog\/experience\/vision of person running .
221	57	of your ASPECT_POST is delusional , especially part about Obama not having lied .
222	57	I am suggesting that you pull your ASPECT_HEAD out of sand .
223	58	Pull your ASPECT_HEAD out of sand .
224	58	Quit living in your false liberal ASPECT_UTOPIA .
225	59	Your ASPECT_POST is but ignorant , liberal ASPECT_UTOPIAN_GARBAGE .
226	59	Wake up !
227	60	He stated facts .
228	60	Would you believe it more if article was written by ASPECT_KARL_MARX ?
229	61	Of ASPECT_COURSE_LIBERALS are trying to portray ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_FOLKS in bad ASPECT_LIGHT .
230	61	LIBERALS are afraid of LIBERALS .
231	61	fact is that nobody has proof that ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_FOLKS have been violent or racist in least ASPECT_BIT .
232	61	Sorry , but you failed .
233	62	You just told me that years do not represent Presidency , ye Palin has not even had , yet you say what you say .
234	62	Kind of hypocritical , is n't KIND ?
236	63	assumes we should vote for ASPECT_EVERYONE_REGARDLESS of stance , then judge after 4 ASPECT_YEARS .
237	63	There 's no ASPECT_CONTRADICTION is saying you would n't vote for -LRB- if you 're completely against them -RRB- and also state that you 'll wait for Presidency to transpire before giving accurate ASPECT_SYNOPSIS .
238	63	CONTRADICTION 's like saying : `` No , YOU 'm not going to read ASPECT_DR._SUESS at ASPECT_AGE_45 , but biography on ASPECT_EUROPEAN_CONQUEST ?
239	63	YOU 'll wait 'til YOU 'm ASPECT_FINISHED_READING_CONTRADICTION to give you rating .
240	64	You do realize that lot of disapproval comes from liberals who are upset with Obama for not ending wars and not closing ASPECT_GITMO_, ASPECT_RIGHT ?
241	64	people are not going to vote for Republican .
242	64	PEOPLE may hold ASPECT_PEOPLE_NOSE when PEOPLE pull lever , but NOSE will be for Obama .
243	65	No ASPECT_ROOM for independents on one , you guys have to pick side .
244	66	Reverse and what ASPECT_ANSWER do YOURSELF come up with ?
245	66	-LRB- -RRB- Look at approval ASPECT_NUMBERS .
246	66	See pattern ?
247	66	, now ask yourself what has he done for black unemployment ASPECT_PROBLEM .
249	67	No , not really .
250	67	Palin has not been president , therefore things I have to judge NO on are NO ASPECT_GOVERNORSHIP -LRB- which has come to its ASPECT_END -RRB- and what NO says in public , and I am disgusted by both .
251	68	Is ASPECT_KARL_MARX member of forum or are you just so desperate to change subject that you had ASPECT_MASSIVE_brain ASPECT_FART ?
252	69	Because formulating counterargument is much harder than simply attacking post content .
253	71	time asks for link on opinion , I will refer them to you , if I may .
254	72	ASPECT_FEEL_FREE .
255	72	But first make clear to them that your ASPECT_OPINION .
257	73	What has he done for black unemployment ASPECT_PROBLEM ?
258	73	Looks to me like American have been hurting since Spring of 2007 .
259	74	You ca n't `` pick side without 2 ASPECT_SIDES to choose from .
260	74	poll does n't include opponent ... hence , POLL useless .
261	75	Well then , they like abuse .
262	76	I did n't change subject .
263	76	You said that ASPECT_KARL_ROVE lied .
264	76	I said ROVE did not .
265	76	facts are facts .
266	77	Well , when you feel like you are debating ASPECT_BRICK_WALL , then you wo n't waste your ASPECT_TIME .
267	77	is what I am doing .
268	78	I just wanted to know if who voted for him would have courage to vote for else since Obama is utter ASPECT_FAILURE and fraud .
269	79	Jesus ... If there my friggin choices i 'm voting indy again .
270	79	Politics with Dumb and ASPECT_DUMBER , difference is Palin would be president MY would n't mind seeing naked ... LOL

281	80	While unemployment for ASPECT_WHITE_AMERICANS averaged 9.3 , African ASPECT_AMERICANS averaged 16.6 , just little less than double ASPECT_RATE of ASPECT_WHITE_UNEMPLOYMENT .
282	80	ASPECT_HISPANIC_AMERICANS reported 13.3 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , while recent , ASPECT_YOUNG_VETERANS are averaging 14.7 .
283	80	Black ASPECT_MEN , over 20 ASPECT_YEARS old , are showing 20.2 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT and ASPECT_TEENAGED_, African ASPECT_AMERICANS , ages 16-19 , of both ASPECT_SEXES , show mind-boggling 39.3 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYED .
284	80	ASPECT_HISPANIC_TEENS also report staggering 30.3 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT .
285	80	ASPECT_LONG-TERM_REPERCUSSIONS of unemployment ASPECT_NUMBERS are troubling , yet Administration is curiously silent .
286	81	Kinda refutes whole idea right-wingers are espousing about how Obama is giving away jobs to ASPECT_OBAMA_FELLOW_BLACKS at expense of whites , does n't KINDA ?
287	81	Personally , I believe , as culture , we Americans are becoming bunch of wimps who are afraid of ASPECT_WE_SHADOWS .
288	81	picture of Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION is good ASPECT_EXAMPLE .
290	82	We watched Bush do of for 4 ASPECT_YEARS and then WE re-elected BUSH did n't WE ?
291	83	We were expected to come out of , 's ASPECT_WAY_WE_ECONOMY works , 's Capitalism .
292	83	As far as fears of jobs I do not believe anybody claimed that yet , fears were with useless ASPECT_GREEN_JOBS designed exactly for .
293	83	I 'm sure you realize .
294	83	Lets go back to original ASPECT_ARGUMENT , why is his ASPECT_APPROVAL over ninety ASPECT_PERCENT with them ?
295	83	Actually close to 95 , ARGUMENT absurd ASPECT_THERE is no ASPECT_REASON for .
296	84	He was supposed to be ASPECT_UN-BUSH_, , , ASPECT_, , Remember ?
297	85	So its ASPECT_OK to call ASPECT_PALIN_NAMES , but if I were to call ASPECT_OBAMA_RACIST , out ASPECT_CRY would be unbearable , RACIST interesting ASPECT_STANCE you liberals take .
298	86	COURAGE doubt ASPECT_INTENTION , but if be your true ASPECT_INTENTION , INTENTION would be smart to start by actually naming who they should `` have courage to vote for .
299	87	lol Wait ... if calls Palin `` name , you can think to do is bring racism into NAME ?
300	87	Why not just equally ASPECT_CALL PALIN name ?
301	88	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- is probably inane of of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_WHINES .
302	88	year since constitutional ASPECT_CONVENTION size of government has increased TO ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS .
303	88	country has gotten bigger ASPECT_YEAR TO ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS .
304	88	Wtf , man ?
305	91	Why would n't he ?
306	92	ASPECT_KARL_ROVE is liar .
307	92	ROVE does n't know how to tell truth .
308	92	ROVE 's one said to ASPECT_RON_SUSSKIND , `` in what we call ASPECT_REALITY-BASED_COMMUNITY , which SUSSKIND defined as people who `` believe that solutions emerge from your judicious ASPECT_STUDY of discernible ASPECT_REALITY .
309	92	... `` 's not way world really works anymore , ROVE continued .
310	92	`` WE 're empire now , and when ASPECT_WE_ACT , WE create ASPECT_WE_REALITY .
311	92	And while you 're studying that reality judiciously , as YOU will WE 'll act again , creating ASPECT_NEW_REALITIES , which YOU can study too , and 's how things will sort out .
312	92	ACTORS 're history actors and ACTORS , of you , will be left to just study what WE do .
313	94	So you do n't like Obama because OBAMA smarter than people and OBAMA knows it ?
314	94	Oh ASPECT_DEAR .
315	94	I hope you did n't go to Ivy .
316	95	I was asking you why you brought ASPECT_KARL_MARX into it .
317	95	I never mentioned ASPECT_KARL_ROVE , less called ASPECT_ROVE liar .
318	95	Are you high or just confused ?
319	96	Sorry Eldedu I was n't clear ASPECT_ENUGH for you I dislike Obama because OBAMA has not figure out who ASPECT_OBAMA wants to be yet and OBAMA does n't know it .
320	96	We are watching ASPECT_OBAMA_MORPH from lesser ASPECT_UNIVERSITY_LAW_LECTURER_TURN into godlike ASPECT_PROPORTIONS because of ASPECT_OBAMA_great ASPECT_PRESS who desperately want OBAMA tobe what ASPECT_OBAMA promises .
321	96	Trouble with promise ?
322	96	day you have to deliver .
323	96	No ASPECT_EASTERN_SCHOOLS for I - SLO and USC ... I doubt I couild get into ASPECT_EASTERN_SCHOOL - not enough pedigree .
324	97	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA campaigned on redistribution of ASPECT_WEALTH_and ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM .
325	97	ASPECT_OBAMA_PROMISE was met .
326	97	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is no ASPECT_ELITIST , ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN makes accusations regularly and unfounded .
327	97	both have college ASPECT_DEGREES , I do n't see how one is `` elite and is not .
328	99	Do n't know yet .
329	99	My ASPECT_POLL was based on fact that Obama is like OBAMA portrayed OBAMA to be during ASPECT_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN -LRB- except distribution of welath , which OBAMA is certainly doing -RRB- , and if would change mind based on fact .
330	100	Since you bring it up , how about you ?
331	101	Obama is going to town with ASPECT_SPENDING\/DEFICIT_INCREASES , and OBAMA has just been in there for little over year .
332	101	I think OBAMA will dwarf President .
333	102	Good ASPECT_POST .
334	102	and ASPECT_FOLKS are feeling way as FOLKS ASPECT_OPEN_FOLKS_EYES and see fraud that Obama is .
335	103	ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES that he mentioned in HE article are facts .
336	103	FAN do n't know about things HE may have said .
337	103	FAN am not fan of or fact-checker for ASPECT_KARL_ROVE .
338	103	FAN just know that ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES implemented by Obama in neighborhood of 640 ASPECT_BILLION so far , are fact of life right now .
339	104	I may have gotten you confused with KVMJ .
340	106	I agree totally .
341	106	He seems un-American .
342	106	people see that .
343	107	Probably because he has trust even though 16 ASPECT_MONTHS into ASPECT_HE_48 ASPECT_MONTH_TERM results are still lacking .
344	107	Time will tell if trust voters put into HE is earned or if VOTERS 'll give chance at bat .
345	108	He campaigned on providing americans with affordable ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_and ASPECT_REDISTRIBUTION of wealth .
346	108	ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS for rich would have never acheived , America knew RICH was going to be liberal .
347	108	RICH said ASPECT_AMERICANS making over 200k year would be taxed more , and is whats happening .
348	108	If george w bush provided ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM way there would have been no ASPECT_OUTCRY .
349	109	He 's just like HE portrayed HE in HE campaign .
350	109	Did you ever listen to speech ?
351	110	What utter ASPECT_NON_SENSE you 're agreeing with .
353	112	You can look at poll like and give benefit of doubt ?
354	112	They went from loving Clinton 's to vilifying THEY .
355	112	What ASPECT_REASON would THEY have to ASPECT_HAVE ASPECT_CLINTON_TRUST ?
356	112	I 'll take wagers ...
357	113	Other than ASPECT_GANG_MEMBERS , ASPECT_KKK_MEMBERS , members of militias , ASPECT_SERIAL_KILLERS , rapists , sex ASPECT_OFFENDERS , arsonists , radical ASPECT_MEMBERS of and ASPECT_RELIGIONS , etc. .
358	113	Other than of them , MAN may well be dangerous ASPECT_MAN in America .
359	113	Do you always exaggerate ?
360	114	Who 's they ?

364	115	But in ASPECT_US_DEFENSE , US a. -RRB- Did n't attend university in US , and b. -RRB- do n't have problem with people who are smarter than US and know US .
366	116	Just maybe .
367	117	When Obama came on scene black ASPECT_PEOPLE turned ASPECT_PEOPLE_BACKS on ASPECT_CLINTONS_PEOPLE hated PEOPLE , 's who
369	118	Are there articles on event because I do n't recall it .
370	118	I do know that , when given choice between ASPECT_HRC_and ASPECT_OBAMA , Obama campaign began to quickly pick up ASPECT_MINORITY_VOTES as CHOICE became more viable .
371	118	IIRC , earlier in year , IIRC was almost given that HRC would gain nomination .
372	118	Obama was interesting ASPECT_CANDIDATE , but not think ASPECT_OBAMA could take HRC in primary .
373	118	HRC was only as ASPECT_PRIMARY_APPROACHED that PRIMARY appeared OBAMA could win PRIMARY .
374	118	As member of GOP , I was rooting for ASPECT_SEN._THOMPSON for ASPECT_SEVERAL_REASONS ... one of which was seeing ASPECT_MRS._THOMPSON in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE for four ASPECT_YEARS .
375	119	She is wearing my ASPECT_NEGLIGEE , MY swear .
376	121	Thanks for link , but I still do n't get your ASPECT_POINT :
377	122	Point is simple , Devil said back at my original ASPECT_CHART that ASPECT_WHITE_VOTERS_WONT_VOTE for Obama because of color .
378	122	's hypocritical when you see way blacks have voted .
379	122	BLACKS give DEVIL 95 approval ASPECT_RATING when DEVIL has not done for BLACKS , BLACKS have ASPECT_DOUBLE_DIGIT_UNEMPLOYMENT and NONE of BLACKS have problem with ?
380	122	Then to further ASPECT_LOOK at BLACKS voting ASPECT_RECORD_LOOK how BLACKS voted against Clinton , person HAS helped BLACKS for how ASPECT_YEARS ?
381	122	ASPECT_BLACKS_VOTE is obviously racist , numbers are right there .
382	122	16 ASPECT_PERCENT_GRAB of ASPECT_BLACKS_VOTE is absurdity .
383	122	Just like 95 ASPECT_APPROVAL is .
384	123	It does n't matter who implemented kind of HCR , IT would still have been met with resistance .
386	124	ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS for 95 of Americans ?
387	124	No ASPECT_EARMARKS ?
388	124	Not ASPECT_BUSINESS as usual ?
389	124	Think again .
390	125	's what said .
391	125	Open your ASPECT_EYES .
392	126	black ASPECT_FOLKS have opened ASPECT_FOLKS_EYES to Obama , and have no ASPECT_INTENTION of voting for OBAMA again .
393	127	I can assure you , if ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH implemented ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM way , everyone would have believed that REFORM would have reduced defecit .
394	128	American , or majority would still be against anything forced , what do you not understand about ?
395	128	ME also have to question your ASPECT_BELIEF about ASPECT_REDUCED_DEFICIT , please show ME where has been done before or anything has come close to estimates .
396	129	He tried .
397	129	Congress likes ASPECT_CONGRESS_BACKROOM deals too much .
398	129	Place blame where CONGRESS belongs , not on whom you prefer to despise .
399	129	There are no ASPECT_TRANSITIONAL_FOSSILS !
400	129	He effectively reduced .
401	129	Be realistic .
402	129	For congress .
403	129	Far from business as usual from president .
404	130	So country has tripled ?
405	131	I do n't believe that at ...
406	132	He would have been vilified as sneaky socialist ASPECT_DIPPING into ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLES_POCKETS even more to give there ASPECT_MONEY to others .
408	133	Speculating ... False .
409	133	`` inherited over 1 ASPECT_+_trillion ASPECT_DOLLAR_NATIONAL_DEBT from ASPECT_CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION .
410	133	In ASPECT_CLINTON_1ST_YEAR in office , beloved `` ASPECT_SPENDER-N-CHIEF_OBAMA increased deficit , spent 3.5 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS and added over 1.5 ASPECT_+_trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT , ASPECT_NEW_RECORD .
411	133	Come 2012 , Obama will have added over 5 + trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT in just 4 short ASPECT_YEARS .
413	133	Isreal support for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA continues to decline .
414	133	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA dropped bombs in ASPECT_PAKISTAN_, Afghanistan and ASPECT_YEMEN_MURDERING_precious ASPECT_LIFE innocent ASPECT_BLOOD .
415	133	Furthermore , `` war of necessity -LRB- Afghanistan `` ASPECT_CONFLICT -RRB- that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA once labeled proceeds on with marginal ASPECT_PROTESTS by ASPECT_LEFT_WING_`` ASPECT_MOONBATS One ASPECT_NATION under bufoon of ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA , about as sharp as ASPECT_BOWLING_BALL ...
417	134	, what you are looking at is ASPECT_BRADLEY_EFFECT , opposite ... When they go vote ASPECT_EFFECT will be ASPECT_OBAMA_, ASPECT_BET on EFFECT .
419	136	Wrong ASPECT_ASSUMPTION .
420	136	I voted for GWB , but would not have been for HCR way GWB has been done , nor would I believe that ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAM would reduce deficit .
423	138	Does n't matter what you believe .
425	139	Because he is 1\/2 ASPECT_BLACK ?
426	139	do n't care that HE is 1\/2 ASPECT_BACK .
427	139	see HE for what HE is ... statist .
428	139	do n't like 1\/2 .
429	140	ASPECT_BRADLY_EFFECT ... Bet your ASPECT_BIPPY .
431	143	EldeduOne ASPECT_POINT regarding your ASPECT_REMARK about higher ASPECT_EDUCATION .
432	143	Surprisingly ASPECT_ONE you find out in attending ASPECT_UNIVERSITIES is attendance , even completing requirements and passing with diploma once completed ... ... .
433	143	does not make person more intellectual ... .
434	143	educated ... .
435	143	which in depends upon what person does with education .
436	144	Dear Dear ASPECT_FROGGER Of posts which have inspired me , or moved ME , or made ASPECT_ME_THINK , or laugh , or cry ... above post you have delivered , nails exactly what is in ASPECT_ME_HEART about man in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE .
437	144	FROGGER is not , nor will never be , President to ME .
438	145	reason we are afraid of them is because you never know when another ASPECT_MCVEIGH is going to emerge from ASPECT_TEA_BAGGERS_GROUP , and how innocent ASPECT_PEOPLE would be hurt , not because PEOPLE have credibility or substance .
439	145	ASPECT_PROOF_WE_HAVE is how conservatives come to ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_DEFENSE and deny CONSERVATIVES are racist .
440	146	No ASPECT_DOUBT about it !
441	146	I like his ASPECT_DETERMINATION .
442	147	Bobo was Bush .
443	147	Bobo is gone , -LRB- good ASPECT_RIDDANCE . -RRB-
444	147	Get with latest !
445	148	's no-brainer .
446	148	Who could GOP possibly put up ?
447	148	Paiin , McCain , Romney , Paul - they 're losers , ASPECT_NOT hard to predict .
448	149	ones with heads in sand , are desperate ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES as CONSERVATIVES try to convince country that things are bad under Obama .
449	149	People are able to see for PEOPLE - your ASPECT_STRATEGY is n't working .
450	150	You do n't like my ASPECT_POST because as loyal , ASPECT_PALIN_IDOLIZER , you ca n't handle truth .
451	150	Keep spreading your `` gloom and ASPECT_DOOM - nobody believes that trash anyway , except ASPECT_COMATOSE_CONSERVATIVES .
453	151	Palin has n't served as President , so of course she has n't had !
454	151	We do n't need to put SHE in position to affirm fact that SHE is stupid , that SHE thinks SHE knows lot about politics because ASPECT_SHE_FOLLOWERS_DROOL over ASPECT_EVERYTHING_SHE says .
455	151	There are people other than droolers , and WE do n't give SHE pass - and you would have to be comatose to vote for SHE .
457	152	reason you feel like you are debating ASPECT_BRICK_WALL is because you have ASPECT_SKEWED_OPINION and wo n't admit facts contradict OPINION , when given to you .
458	152	Of course I 'm not going to agree with lies being spewed here .
459	153	Geez , like you have n't called ASPECT_OBAMA_NAMES ?
460	153	And , fact that Palin is bimbo has to do with her being white , HER is just dumb , WHITE does n't matter what color ASPECT_HER is .
461	154	Could it be because even dumb ASPECT_SARAH is able to recognize that Obama graduated from Harvard , ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM_LAUDE , while SARAH attended 5 ASPECT_COLLEGES , and SARAH still does n't know much ?
462	155	No ASPECT_SPECULATION .
463	155	conservatives on forum adored Bush , warts and , and would never have criticized anything ASPECT_BUSH did .
464	155	Is according to Republican rewriting of History ?
465	155	ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON reversed Reagan course , raising taxes on wealthy , and lowering WEALTHY for working and ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASSES .
466	155	produced longest sustained ASPECT_ECONOMIC_EXPANSION in ASPECT_AMERICAN_HISTORY .
467	155	Importantly , also produced budgetary ASPECT_SURPLUSES allowing government to begin paying down crippling ASPECT_DEBT begun under Reagan .
468	155	In 2000 , Clinton year , surplus amounted to 236 ASPECT_BILLION .
469	155	ASPECT_FORECAST_ten ASPECT_YEAR_SURPLUS stood at 5.6 ASPECT_TRILLION .
470	155	It was black ASPECT_INK_AMERICA would see for decades , perhaps forever .
471	155	ASPECT_GEORGE_W._BUSH immediately reversed Clinton policy in order to revive Reagan , once again showering embarrassment of riches on already embarrassingly rich , BUSH `` ASPECT_BASE as BUSH calls them .
472	155	BUSH ladled out 630 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_TAX_CUTS to top ASPECT_1 of ASPECT_INCOME_EARNERS .
473	155	In true ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_FASHION , EARNERS returned favor by investing over 200 ASPECT_MILLION to ensure Bush re-election .
474	155	Do math .
475	155	630 billion ASPECT_RETURN on 200 million ASPECT_INVESTMENT : 3,160 for 1 .
476	155	I 'll give you 3,160 .
477	155	All I ask is that you give I 1 back so I can keep goodness flowing .
478	155	Do we have deal ?
479	155	Republicans know return on investment .
480	155	What you forget to mention is that doing would have put WE in depression .
481	155	Obama had to do major ASPECT_SURGERY to repair damage caused by Bush .
482	155	WE owe ASPECT_WE_THANKS to Bush !
483	155	Israel is not world , but still , is just conservative ASPECT_RHETORIC .
484	155	Obama supports Israel .
485	155	ASPECT_APR_9 , 2010Do you approve or disapprove of ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION handling of ASPECT_U.S.-ISRAEL_RELATIONS ?
486	155	ASPECT_NEW_, annual ASPECT_SURVEY of ASPECT_AMERICAN_JEWISH_PUBLIC_OPINION by ASPECT_AMERICAN_JEWISH_COMMITTEE finds that Jews , by and large , continue to approve of ASPECT_OBAMA_57 ASPECT_PERCENT say they approve of ASPECT_JOB_OBAMA ASPECT_DOING and also back OBAMA handling of Israel .
487	155	http:\/\/www.politico.com\/blogs\/bensmi...on_Israel.html Well , it is apparent that Republicans do not like Obama , but to take WELL to level of lying about ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY is totally wild .
488	155	buffoon we 've had was ASPECT_BUSH and thank ASPECT_GOD_BUSH is history -LRB- bad ASPECT_HISTORY at -RRB- .
489	156	What conservative ASPECT_ROCK did you crawl out from ?
490	156	Where did you hear that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE was free , on Faux ASPECT_NEWS ?
491	156	No ASPECT_WONDER .
492	156	rest of your ASPECT_POST_SOUNDS like Limbaugh mentioned on one of his loony ASPECT_RANTS .
493	158	Consider ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN as ASPECT_IDI_AMIN - they both have IQ .
495	159	Now is one accurate ASPECT_POST !
496	159	Good ASPECT_JOB !
497	162	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- He probably will dwarf president .
498	162	I 'm pretty sure that HE would have preferred to take office after Clinton than after Bush .
499	163	I would need proof of , I still think you will see ASPECT_HUGE_VOTE for color in ASPECT_UPCOMING_ELECTION , same as .
500	164	If Obama has let banks fail , and not pushed stimulus of ASPECT_SIZE_OBAMA did , we would currently be facing ASPECT_SIMILAR_SITUATIONS as took place in 1920 and 1930 , runs on banks , 25-30 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , return of Hoovervilles .
501	164	Obama , if for no ASPECT_REASON will be favorably looked upon 50-100 ASPECT_YEARS from now as one who had courage to take risk , and invest in America , instead of pulling ASPECT_EVERYTHING_IN , and letting COURAGE die .
502	164	Do you really know what VAT is ?
503	164	people who are calling for ASPECT_FLAT_TAX , or major ASPECT_CHANGE to taxation are in favor of methods similar to VAT , because unlike ASPECT_INCOME_TAX , with of it 's loopholes , ASPECT_VALUE_ADDED_TAX , or consumption ASPECT_TAX .
504	164	TAX fair than BS ASPECT_WE_DEAL with now , and means people pay fair ASPECT_TAX_BURDEN .
505	164	TAX 's also easier to track than trying to keep history on american income , since TAX collected at ASPECT_BUSINESS_LEVEL at time of sale .
506	164	You only have to track businesses , so it essentially means end of IRS as WE know END .
507	164	I 'd love to see major ASPECT_REDUCTION in ASPECT_IRS_I , is n't that smaller ASPECT_GOVERNMENT ?
508	164	I have n't looked at great ASPECT_DEAL , but Bush did n't exactly spend alot of time trying to secure ASPECT_WE_BORDERS either ... in fact as I recall Bush wanted to give em amnesty ... so at worst WE 're no worse off than before .
509	164	Cap and ASPECT_TRADE is good ASPECT_IDEA , and if CAP gets WE as country off of Oil , and using ASPECT_RENEWABLE_ENERGY , we as country will be way ahead of rest of world , and be able to laugh when oil runs out .
510	164	Because day , DAY certainly will , and I for one would rather have ASPECT_RENEWABLE_FORM of ASPECT_ENERGY_READY sooner rather than later .
511	165	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ASPECT_WELL , we do have trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS worth of wars to contend with year -LRB- WE should count wars as ASPECT_OFF-BUDGET_ITEMS like Bush did -RRB- .
512	165	And annual trillion ASPECT_DOLLAR_defense ASPECT_BUDGET .
513	165	Not to mention ASPECT_HUGE_HOLE in budget ASPECT_BUSH left behind by BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUTS , which , I heard , has cost ASPECT_TREASURY_2.6 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS .
514	165	And ASPECT_BANK_FAILURES .
515	165	And export of of major ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE-PRODUCING_INDUSTRIES .
516	165	Did I mention that Depressions are expensive ?
517	165	Like brie with whine ?
518	166	please you fail at your ASPECT_ATTEMPT at trying to be and sound like elitist also .
519	166	His ASPECT_SPENDING of control .
520	166	Worse ASPECT_BY far then president ... Socialism costs lot of ASPECT_PEOPLES_MONEY , so HIS can keep spending ... LOL
521	167	likely .
522	167	HE has kept of HE ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_PROMISES .
523	167	HE has been transparent .
524	167	HE has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no ASPECT_TAX_CUT for 95 of Americans -RRB- , which is desparately needed .
525	167	HE has increased spending\/size of government to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS , and saved us from another great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
526	167	He has \/ will increase US deficit to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS , and saved US from another great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
527	167	HE pushes through legislation HE promised to do and was voted in for .
528	167	HE has strengthened America position in international ASPECT_COMMUNITY , and reversed ASPECT_NEW_cold ASPECT_WAR .
529	167	HE has ASPECT_SEVERAL_proposed ASPECT_POLICIES will help Americans and US economy .
530	167	HE is welcomed by ASPECT_US_ALLIES and isolating US ASPECT_ENEMIES .
531	167	HE is continuously lied about by conservative ASPECT_MEDIA .
532	167	ECONOMY depends on who is run against HE , but ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION has been big positive ASPECT_CHANGE for America .
533	169	McVeigh was ASPECT_NUT_JOB .
534	169	group has them .
535	169	For part , ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_FOLKS are average ASPECT_EVERYDAY_FOLKS are sick and tired of big ASPECT_BUREAUCRACY , big ASPECT_GOVERNMENT , ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_WASTE , and ASPECT_EVER-INCREASING_TAXES .
536	169	There are racist ASPECT_PEOPLE in groups , but to call ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT_RACIST or violent , just ASPECT_EXHIBITS_IGNORANCE .
537	170	ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH : It does n't matter who is President now .
538	170	Things are bad , and they are not headed in right ASPECT_DIRECTION .
539	170	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_recovery and ASPECT_JOB_CREATION comes from ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR , not government .
540	170	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_RECOVERY would happen if RECOVERY were not for government getting in way .
541	171	I do not idolize Palin .
542	171	I like her .
543	171	I believe that I have told you in another ASPECT_THREAD while back , that I really hope that HER does not run .
544	171	I think there are better ASPECT_CANDIDATES out there .
545	171	I just hope that HER continues to be pain in butt for left , and spreads word about CANDIDATES that MSM does not like to .
546	172	funny is that folks knew that Obama was n't ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL , and now OBAMA has proved that OBAMA is not ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL , yet you drones still follow OBAMA like ASPECT_SHEEP_HEADING toward cliff .
547	173	Well , we have skewed opinions , otherwise WE would be brain dead .
548	174	stimulus was failure and full of earmarks .
549	174	Invest in creating ASPECT_RECORD_DEFICIT , with little to show for DEFICIT .
550	174	problem is that VAT , if implemented , would be additional ASPECT_TAX , and not replace anything .
551	174	Bush , McCain , and ASPECT_OBAMA_support ASPECT_AMNESTY .
552	174	fact remains that Obama has gone backward on enforcement .
553	174	We know that WE need alternative ASPECT_FORMS of energy .
554	174	Cap & ASPECT_TRADE is but tax on corporations will trickle down to ASPECT_GOODS_and ASPECT_SERVICES , because everything takes energy to produce , transport , etc. .
555	175	I do n't know whether to laugh at as joke or ASPECT_CRY at because of how ignorant and ASPECT_MISINFORMED you are .
556	176	Funny , I had reaction reading your ASPECT_OP .
557	177	It appears he does n't worship at altar of Beck .
558	177	Do you think viewing ASPECT_GLENN_BECK should be mandatory ?
559	178	make 2 of us .
560	179	Of course , your ASPECT_LIBERALS .
561	180	I think liberals could learn alot from guys like Beck .
562	180	LIBERALS should listen to talk radio .
563	181	Of course .
564	181	You 're conservative .
565	183	ASPECT_OSTAP_BENDER , who are BENDER going to vote for in 2012 ASPECT_ELECTIONS ?

571	186	figures , conservatives are so used to lies , CONSERVATIVES think CONSERVATIVES are great !
572	186	Of course , OLD could be attributed to not remembering , but there are so ASPECT_INSTANCES where BECK has been caught lying , I think BECK is just used to OLD .
573	186	YouTube - ASPECT_GLENN_BECK_CAUGHT_LYING and Smearing ...
574	187	Conservatives hit you with CONSERVATIVES !
576	188	I 'm just happy with freebies and want to elect Obama for life .
577	188	Let pay for I stuff .
578	189	like ASPECT_LET slaughter ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS and steepen rates for corporate ASPECT_ACCOUNTS , because clearly ASPECT_SIMPLE_FOLKS and illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRANTS deserve .

580	190	majority of fox ASPECT_NEW is so biased that BE ASPECT_ISNT even worth ASPECT_WATCHING .
581	190	if you want fair and balanced your ASPECT_OPTION nowa ASPECT_DAYS is cnn .
582	190	you really think that if times were better ASPECT_PEOPLE like ASPECT_GLEN_BECK would have been able to capitalize on ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLES_ANGER toward government ???
583	190	who says that race is not factor driving ASPECT_OBAMA_HATRED tell do ASPECT_WE_THINK would be better with mccain as president would economy be doing so ASPECT_BETTER would ASPECT_JOBS suddenly be ASPECT_SKY_ROCKETING ??
584	190	what could mccain be doin to help improve things ???
585	190	yes we would have smaller ASPECT_GOV. .
586	190	and less ASPECT_GOV_SPENDING but how does tha go to fixxing ASPECT_JOB_LOSS and economy ???
587	190	as for who -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- about ASPECT_OBAMA_raising ASPECT_TAXES let ME ask did you recive bigger ASPECT_RETURN in ASPECT_PRIOR_YEARS ???

589	192	Is Kenia in Hawaii ?
590	194	Did you hear that on ASPECT_GLENN_BECK_SHOW or was telegraphed from Mars ?
591	194	Seriously , nice to have opinion on matter , so if you said you thought BECK was unfit , then fine .
592	194	OTOH , when you say `` of YOU agree , would be proper to provide basis of your ASPECT_CONCLUSION such as facts .
593	194	Are you basing on scientifically verifiable ASPECT_POLLING_DATA ?
594	194	ASPECT_NEWS_ARTICLE ?
595	194	ASPECT_GLENN_BECK tears ?
596	194	`` of YOU want to know .
597	195	Not that I was basing I on statistic , just look up , and you 'll understand what I meant by us .
598	196	ASPECT_POLL_QUESTION was `` Will you vote for Obama in 2012 ?
599	196	not `` Is Obama fit to be President as you stated .
600	196	could have voted No simply because want to see hotties in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE , not because of ASPECT_ANYONES_FITNESS for office :
601	197	you mean ASPECT_BAILIN_and ASPECT_NOJEANS ?
602	198	Awesome ASPECT_PICTURE , ok , I 'll apologize ; I do n't want Obama in office , and I think OBAMA and socialists should go to Canada .
603	199	Where they can form stronger ASPECT_BAND of socialists ?
604	199	Maybe THEY 'll go after Rush fulfills his ASPECT_PROMISE of moving to HIS ASPECT_MEGABUCK_ESTATE in Costa ASPECT_RICA .
605	199	Here 's another great ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_POSTER :
606	200	Quite ASPECT_PAIR_, ASPECT_RIGHT ?
607	200	Or is two ASPECT_PAIR ?
608	200	I 'm confused .
609	200	Back on topic ; if Obama does n't get economy turned around in two ASPECT_YEARS , OBAMA 'll join ASPECT_GEORGE_H._W._BUSH as ASPECT_ONE-TERM_PRESIDENT .
610	202	I do n't think ASPECT_MALE_SOLDIERS would have problem standing at attention if they were in ASPECT_CAWE_C'MON , had to say
612	203	Even about ASPECT_KENYAN_born ASPECT_PART .
613	203	ASPECT_MICHELLE_OBAMA spilled beans on one when she referred to Kenya as Obama home ASPECT_COUNTRY in speech .
614	204	I 'm usually very accurate , but mistakes happen .
615	204	If is you have got on conservatives , then I think we 're doing fine .
616	205	I could sit here day posting videos of ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_OBAMA_CRONIES spewing lies .
617	205	For part , conservative ASPECT_RADIO and of conservatives on TV have ASPECT_PART_RIGHT .
618	205	We 've got your .
619	206	Another liberal ASPECT_DRONE .
620	206	Obama fixing economy ... where ?
621	206	ASPECT_OBAMA_TAX_CUTS ... where ?
622	206	Are you talking about U.S. ?
623	207	is perception you get when your sole ASPECT_SOURCE of information is ASPECT_MURDOCH_PROPOGANDA_OUTLETS .
624	208	My ASPECT_QUESTIONS are legitimate , and MY will be waiting for answers .
625	209	He happens to love country more than Obama , you should keep that in mind ~ ASPECT_~_~ ~
626	210	What would you call American who loved Germany so much he puts ASPECT_GERMAN_INTERESTS above America .
627	210	I know what I 'd call AMERICAN .
628	210	Hint ; GERMANY ASPECT_SEVEN-LETTER_WORD which begins with ASPECT_T._T. civilized to respect people even if ASPECT_PEOPLE_VIEWS are different or opposing , but how can respect txxxxxx even if PEOPLE favor your ASPECT_SIDE ?
629	211	I 'd salute !
630	212	You mean you are really unaware that ASPECT_OBAMA_STIMULUS_PACKAGE included over 300 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_TAX_CUTS , and you are really unaware that economy has gone from -6 ASPECT_&#37;_annual ASPECT_GROWTH_RATE to +6 , ASPECT_JOB_LOSS have gone from 700,000 ASPECT_LOSSES to gains , unemployment ASPECT_RATE peaked and is now lower , productivity is now growing at 6 , ASPECT_HOUSING_MARKETS have stabilized and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKETS are up 70 since March ?
631	212	You really do need to broaden your ASPECT_INFORMATION_SOURCES because you are obviously not getting ASPECT_RELEVAT_INFORMATION .
632	212	No ASPECT_WONDER you have negative ASPECT_VIEW of Obama .
633	212	of us who evaluate broader ASPECT_SOURCE of information know better .
634	213	What makes you say ?
635	214	Yes mertex we believe you .
636	214	Everyone here knows that ASPECT_LIBERALS_FEAR of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT has to do whatsoever with ASPECT_LIBERALS_FEAR of being elected right out of power .
637	214	While WE are at MOVEMENT shoveling load of b.s. that liberal ASPECT_LEFTS_fear and ASPECT_HATRED of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT has to do whatsoever with LEFTS fear of loss of ASPECT_POLITICAL_POWER , why do n't WE sell bridges or make money scamming people with ASPECT_NIGERIA_EMAIL_CHAIN_LETTER too while WE are at MOVEMENT .
638	214	After if you expect LEFTS to believe that liberal ASPECT_LEFTS_FEAR of and hate for ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT has to do with politics , you might as well as you clearly expect folks to beleive anything you tell FOLKS too believe .
639	214	Too bad for liberals that gig is up , majority of people see LIBERALS for ASPECT_POWER_HUNGRY_SOCIALISTS_LIBERALS are , and also reject ASPECT_LIBERALS_and ASPECT_LIBERALS_IDEOLOGY .
640	214	Too bad ASPECT_LIBERALS 're on way out November .
641	214	-LRB- By way , Dems lost badly here in Ohio in ASPECT_EARLY_PROVISONAL_VOTING . -RRB-
642	214	ASPECT_UT_OH ...
643	215	Yeah I agree , I do n't get it things have been discussed to death , ONES are obvious ASPECT_ONES .
644	215	In fact of libs applaud ... LOL .
646	216	You go to one ASPECT_SOURCE , others go to others .
647	216	Just ASPECT_SEEMS like you pay attention to optimistic ASPECT_SIDE .
648	216	Great ASPECT_POINT you made there .
649	216	And , I dont think is worried RIGHT ASPECT_NOW .
650	216	We are worried about country future .
651	216	I dont care if ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH has happened over two ASPECT_MONTHS when they are passing legislation will lay stagnant for years .
652	216	How does government go about spending ASPECT_TAX_MONEY_WHILE providing ASPECT_TAX_CUTS ?
653	216	Fact : Obama ASPECT_1ST_TERM increased ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT 4x than Bush worst ASPECT_TERM .
654	216	Not to let bush off line , but did forget ?
655	216	They are using ASPECT_TAX_MONEY to pay back ASPECT_BARROWED_MONEY_+_INTEREST ?
656	216	point is , providing ASPECT_TAX_CUTS while spending is just another ASPECT_WAY to try to trick economy into getting better .
657	216	What ASPECT_SKEPTICS_THINK is that when ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS turn into ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES -LRB- which POINT will , or government will default -RRB- , thats when -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- hits fan .
658	216	Stop thinking in now ASPECT_GOD d ASPECT_MN_STOP .
659	216	Not successful ASPECT_BUSINESS_MEN thinks short ASPECT_TERM .
660	217	I am so tired of hearing about ASPECT_TAX_CUTS that Obama has blessed us with .
661	217	Yet never seeing liberal ASPECT_ANYWHERE who can point to precise ASPECT_TAX_CODE , precise ASPECT_ITEM , or precise ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL to which said `` cuts apply .
662	217	So by means , if `` ASPECT_CUTS do exist , show US where .
663	217	Post links .
664	217	Show US where and what ASPECT_PRECISELY so ASPECT_CALLED_TAX_CUTS were ?
665	217	Which ASPECT_TAX_CODES did `` ASPECT_CUTS_ADDRESS .
666	217	Who did ASPECT_CUT_TAXATION for ?
667	217	What ASPECT_GOODS did ASPECT_CUT_TAXATION on ?
668	217	By what percent did lower rate of taxation ?
669	217	Simply declaring that Obama so called ASPECT_STIMULUS_CUT_TAXATION , does not make TAXATION so .
670	217	Just as simply declaring that Obama so called stimulus turned economy around and brought us out of recession did n't make STIMULUS so either .
671	217	You see liberals , LIBERALS al know for fact that so called ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , increased taxation on poorest ASPECT_AMERICANS .
672	217	Because AL increased taxation on ASPECT_TOBACCO_and ASPECT_ALCOHOL .
673	217	And well , well , well , guess who just happens to drink and smoke in nation .
674	217	You got GUESS , poorest ASPECT_AMERICANS .
675	217	So where are `` ASPECT_CUTS at Ireimon .
676	217	Oh and if you happen to be referring to `` ASPECT_CUTS he and HE ASPECT_DEMOPHONY_CRONIES in Congress plan to make to ASPECT_MEDICAID_and ASPECT_MEDICARE .
677	217	are not ASPECT_TAX_CUTS , are robbing poorest ASPECT_AMERICANS , to give to richest , and are not in so called `` ASPECT_STIMULUS either but rather were in ASPECT_LIBERALS_HEALTHCARE dictate otherwise known as tyrantcare .
678	218	WHO IS THEY ?
679	218	ASPECT_TELL_ME !!
680	218	, why do you constantly lump people together , , why ?
681	218	Dont you understand DONT makes you wrong automatically ?
683	219	Now now in fairness there has been ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH .
684	219	problem is however , that for job created , two ASPECT_OTHERS went away .
685	219	administration , and ADMINISTRATION liberal ASPECT_SUPPORTERS however always want to point to ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH in or ASPECT_ECONOMIC_SECTOR , as for ASPECT_EXAMPLE_SUPPORTERS do inm pointing to creation of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_JOBS , due to ASPECT_WORKERS_ADMINISTRATION hired for census .
686	219	Yet do so , while ignoring fact that in sectors of economy there was ASPECT_NET_LOSS in jobs , and jobs which YET created , are not permanent ASPECT_JOBS but rather are temporary and YET will go away later year too .
687	219	How hypocritical of left to lecture everyone about looking at `` broader ASPECT_PICTURE when YET so excel at cherry picking data which suits YET .
688	221	Flounder is n't it interesting that while telling us about how US need to run around `` fearing ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT , because of hatred and ASPECT_VIOLENCE .
689	221	And not because movement stands chance of kicking liberals out of ASPECT_POLITICAL_POWER .
690	221	ASPECT_LIBTARDS_LIBTARDS_RESORT to use of hateful , ASPECT_SEXUALY_, explicit ASPECT_DENIGRATING , derogatory , terminology as `` ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER .
691	221	USE does not get much more hypocritical than ASPECT_LADIES_and ASPECT_GENTS , than for liberals to lecture everyone about `` tone and `` respectful ASPECT_DISCOURSE ASPECT_WHILE_labeling ASPECT_LADIES ASPECT_POLITICAL_OPPOSITION with ASPECT_DERAGATORY_TERMS as `` ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER and slandering movement with false , ASPECT_UNSUBSTANTIATED_, ASPECT_UNSPPORTED by fact , assertions of violence .
692	221	Especially given ASPECT_TIME_and ASPECT_TIME again , in incident after incident , TIME been leftists who become\/became violent while protesting .
693	221	Infact , during term of ASPECT_FORMER_PRESIDENT_BUSH , liberals who are now so worried about violence , defended things as assault and ASPECT_VIOLENCE comitted by ASPECT_FELLOW_LIBERALS , in incidents such as throwing pies , vandalism to ASPECT_PRIVATE_PROPERTY saying actions comitted by leftists , in ASPECT_LIBERALS_NAME , for LIBERALS `` cause was defended as `` free ASPECT_SPEECH and `` patriotism .
694	221	And 's not even taking into account , LIBERALS attempted defense of recent ASPECT_ATTACK on persons leaving ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_FUNDRAISER , by attempting to outright ASPECT_LIE concerning facts of case .
695	221	Claiming first that it was not liberals who were there protesting which comitted attack , and then falsely claiming that attack was not politically motivated , eventhough ASPECT_NEW_ORLEANS_POLICE_DEPARTMENT_SAY ATTACK was .
696	221	See once again , we are supposed to ignore fact that FACT by far , more often than not , leftists who become violent in face of opposition to LEFTISTS ideology .
697	221	So liberals can pretend VICTIMS 're just poor misunderstood ASPECT_VICTIMS .
698	223	You sound like rest of ASPECT_COMATOSE_CONSERVATIVES , that listen to Faux ASPECT_NEWS .
699	223	CONSERVATIVES never get REST right , CONSERVATIVES just repeat BS ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES hear on stations trying to pose as ASPECT_NEWS_STATION .
700	223	What ASPECT_FREEBIES are CONSERVATIVES getting , anyway ?
701	224	But they would n't be true .
702	224	THEY would be made up by Faux ASPECT_NEWS to fool ASPECT_NEWS_VIEWERS .
703	224	If THEY had NEWS right , THEY would n't have lost .
704	224	But , sooner or later NEWS is going to hit home , NEWS might take ASPECT_COUPLE_LOSSES , ASPECT_KOOL_AID has long lasting ASPECT_EFFECTS .
705	225	Your `` ASPECT_FACT is wrong .
707	226	AGREED how I vote ; I consider field of candidates , CANDIDATES past accomplishments , issues at stake and best ASPECT_INTERESTS of country before voting .
708	226	We 're two and half ASPECT_YEARS out from election , TWO little early to be deciding ... unless EXTREMIST 're rabid ASPECT_EXTREMIST who will vote for or against based upon ASPECT_SKEWED_POLITICAL_AGENDA .
709	226	Then , by means , go right ahead and rant from your ASPECT_SOAPBOXES in park .
710	227	ASPECT_TAX_CUTS will be wiped out with ASPECT_FUTURE_TAX_INCREASES .
711	227	He has already signed for 640 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES .
712	227	of jobs supposedly gained are ASPECT_TEMPORARY_JOBS such as census ASPECT_WORKER_JOBS , and are ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_JOBS .
713	227	Economic recover happens from ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR , not government .
714	227	There is talk of second ASPECT_WAVE of foreclosures and unemployment .
715	227	Do n't buy into false ASPECT_NUMBERS Obama likes to throw around .
716	228	childish and baseless ASPECT_REPLY .
717	228	If they are wrong , why does conservative ASPECT_RADIO_and ASPECT_TV have highest ASPECT_RATINGS in country ?
719	230	Bush is even more reasonable for ASPECT_TAX_HIKES needed in future than Obama .
720	230	ASPECT_PRESCRIPTION_DRUG_PLAN BUSH did n't even attempt to pay for FUTURE , Obama atleast has tried .
721	230	Everyone says cuts to medicare and reducing subsidies for cadillac ASPECT_PLANS will be repealled , may be true in today politics , by 2018 debt will be so huge China may no longer be buying CHINA .
722	230	At ASPECT_POINT_CUTS will have to happen .
723	230	Bush got into Iraq which has cost ton of money .
724	230	Iraq was optional , Afghanistan was n't .
725	230	Bush second ASPECT_TAX_CUT was while debt was getting really ASPECT_BIG and US was already in 2 ASPECT_WARS , ASPECT_TAX_CUT was perfectly fine .
726	231	Now that you 've been informed about status of Obama ASPECT_TAX_CUTS and ASPECT_ECONOMIC_PERFORMANCE , apparently for time , do you really believe that ASPECT_GDP_, productivity , ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT and like are ASPECT_NUMBERS_OBAMA created ?
727	231	Now who told you that ?
731	232	He does own economy .
732	232	blaming Bush ASPECT_GAME is over .
733	233	Of course , it 's Bush fault , and always will be to you ASPECT_LIBERALS .
734	234	Presidents are generally over-credited as to economy by folks who lack comprehension .
735	234	But I 'll add your ASPECT_STATEMENT to list of others who credit Obama for how economy is doing now .
736	234	STATEMENT portends well for Obama in future .
737	235	ASPECT_IM_NOT liberal , I am fiscal ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE .
738	235	IF does actions cause ASPECT_LONG-TERM_DEBT IM that ASPECT_PERSON_FAULT if tough ASPECT_MEASURES have to happen to correct path that person help set .
739	236	You are using old ASPECT_FASHIONED , ASPECT_PRE_1981 ASPECT_MEANING of ASPECT_WORD_`` ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE .
740	236	Back then MEANING meant you believed budget should be balanced , even if you had to raise taxes to do BUDGET .
741	236	To today conservative , `` fiscal ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE means you cut taxes and borrow difference .
742	236	Your ASPECT_TERMINOLOGY is just confusing to modern ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES .
743	238	No , No , No. ... he 's not worth it .
744	238	I am glad ASPECT_MAJORITY of poll said `` No .
745	238	HE is too unpredictable for I tastes .
746	238	Just when you think HE is going to show ASPECT_BIPARTIN_EFFORTS , HE let 's us down of time .
747	238	I will definitely work hard at campaigning for Palin if runs .
748	238	I detest man and MAN stands for .
749	238	I try to see good ASPECT_MAN does for US country but ASPECT_MAN_vanity and ASPECT_SELF_RIGHTEOUSNESS turns I off .
750	239	Complete with ASPECT_JACK_DANIEL_CHASER_??
752	240	Nope , I 'm just conservative who can barely dress himself day .
753	240	I thoughts are so out of whack that I brain barely functions .
754	240	I lived in MA and used to vote Democrat .
755	240	I moved to NH , was raising family , attending `` ASPECT_TOWN_MEETING times in I small ASPECT_TOWN and learned fiscal ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY in govt and I then realized that ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE , and conservative fiscal ASPECT_POLICY belongs in govt .
756	240	I was hooked to conservatism and have never changed
757	241	Oh it 's great .
758	241	Unemployment hovering at 9.7 nationwide .
759	241	Over 12 in California .
760	241	If you factor in folks who are no longer able to receive unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS , and working ASPECT_TEMPORARY_JOBS , Underemployment\/unemployment is way high .
761	241	Foreclosures still happening .
762	241	Great ASPECT_ECONOMY .
763	241	ASPECT_THANKS_OBAMA !
764	242	I 'm fairly conservative I , but I do n't like how ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY lies .
765	242	They are not really conservative , so why buy into THEY lies .
766	242	Besides , THEY are way too greedy for I .
767	242	It is n't so much about being conservative , but about ASPECT_NOT wanting to help under-privileged .
768	242	I could never be like .
769	242	I lived in NH , also , in Bedford , worked in MA .
770	242	NH was funny , people of NH did n't like people in Mass because PEOPLE came up to use ASPECT_PEOPLE_SKI_RESORTS and vacation in NH , and people in Mass did n't like people of NH because PEOPLE came to Mass and took jobs !
771	242	Pretty funny .
772	242	I lived in NH because Mass was way too expensive , beautiful ASPECT_COUNTRY but too -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_COLD for I .
773	243	Thank ASPECT_BUSH , BOZO is Bozo did it .
774	243	You keep blaming Obama , but everyone knows it was Bush tanked country .
775	243	very ASPECT_LIMITED in ability to decipher truth blame Obama for what party did .
776	243	is getting pretty darn ASPECT_OLD .
777	243	Take ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY for your ASPECT_PARTY mistakes and ASPECT_INABILITIES instead of repeating lies .
778	243	country knew better ASPECT_NOV_2008 , what makes you think 've forgotten ?
779	245	By whose ASPECT_MEASURE ?
780	245	Don be sucked in by ASPECT_PUBLIC_POLLS .
781	245	They can change quickly either way as ASPECT_PRESIDENT_G._H._W._BUSH found out in 1992 .
782	245	year can make ASPECT_HUGE_DIFFERENCE .
783	245	Obama still has 2.5 ASPECT_YEARS to find ASPECT_OBAMA_FOOTING .
784	245	Time will tell .
785	245	Who do you like for running against OBAMA ?
786	247	It just proves one as far as I am concerned , ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE had no ASPECT_PROBLEM electing black ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
787	247	IT ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_OBAMA_IDEAS fell short , and IT can not be blamed on racism .
788	248	Bush had ASPECT_SPENDING_ISSUES , and BUSH unfortunately , had bailouts of BUSH , but Obama took ASPECT_SPENDING\/DEFICIT_CREATION to whole ASPECT_NEW_LEVEL .
789	248	BUSH increased size of government like nobody else .
790	248	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_RECOVERY happens from ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR , not government .
791	248	You should know .
792	249	Well then , I guess guy has his\/her work cut out for them .
793	250	ASPECT_PALIN_and ASPECT_OBAMA are n't apples to ASPECT_APPLES_COMPARISON .
794	250	So , yes , Palin is not worthy of consideration .
795	251	Palin retarded ASPECT_SON would be step up as President than what we have now , Bobo , ASPECT_POST_TURTLE .
796	251	Hell , SON ` ASPECT_LD_VOTE for three ASPECT_DAY_old ASPECT_DOG_turd ASPECT_VICE , Bobo , ASPECT_POST_TURTLE .
797	253	She cant get SHE to agree with .
798	253	Since ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_JOBS guarantees minority hiring 's way to recovery for SHE .
799	253	prosperity and ASPECT_GROWTH of America means , just like Obama .
800	254	You are correct , Palin was ten ASPECT_TIMES more qualified for presidency than Obama .
801	254	TEN simply unfair to lower her to ASPECT_OBAMA_LEVEL of incompetence and ASPECT_IDIOCY .
802	255	Doubtful ... but I bet she looks ASPECT_LOT_HOTTER in bikini .
803	256	Ok , maybe little overzealous , at least 9.4 ASPECT_TIMES more qualified .
804	256	I really do n't want either of images in I head , please stop !
805	258	We already know what ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES vote for and consider `` ASPECT_INTELLIGENT - Bush , Palin , Quayle , so , no ASPECT_WONDER you would think Palin son would be step up !
806	258	Obama is nowhere near bottom of `` dumb ASPECT_PILE along with your ASPECT_GROUP - enjoy your sour ASPECT_GRAPES !
807	259	Bush ASPECT_41 I liked .
808	259	Bush ASPECT_43 , not so much .
809	259	Palin I like .
810	259	Quayle , I do n't like ... and there is no ASPECT_ONE , not even jimmy carter , has been worse ASPECT_PRESIDENT than Bobo , ASPECT_POST_TURTLE .
811	260	Leadership is n't ASPECT_TEST_SCORE .
812	260	SCORE of attributes , sadly many that Obama lacks .
813	260	president is supposed to be leader , not whiny ASPECT_APPOLOGIST .
814	260	We can certainly see now what liberal ` intelligence ASPECT_' is getting WE , and people simply do n't like NOW .
815	260	Obamabots seem to treasure ASPECT_OBAMABOTS_` intelligence ASPECT_' .
816	260	Has OBAMABOTS released ASPECT_OBAMABOTS_TRANSCRIPTS yet ?
817	260	Just for comparison ASPECT_PURPOSES .
818	261	Not quite as chlldish and baseless as repeated ASPECT_MANTRA of `` so-called ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES .
819	261	Everything about Faux ASPECT_NEWS is farce .
820	261	First of , CONSERVATIVES ratings only include viewers for one `` ASPECT_CABLE_STATION .
821	261	Add ASPECT_CABLE_STATIONS together , plus ABC , NBC , and CBS , and Faux ASPECT_NEWS comes out short .
822	261	Liberals are not glued to MSNBC - station compares to Faux ASPECT_NEWS in NEWS biased broadcasting , as conservatives are to Faux ASPECT_NEWS .
823	261	So much for your ASPECT_RATINGS !

825	261	Have ASPECT_REPUBLICANS_BEEN_OUT-FOXED ?
826	261	conservatives are beginning to question whether Fox ASPECT_NEWS is good for ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_MOVEMENT .
827	261	By ASPECT_EVE_CONANT_|_NEWSWEEK_WEB_EXCLUSIVEAPR_13 , 2010GOP ASPECT_SEN._TOM_COBURN scored perfect ASPECT_100 on ASPECT_AMERICAN_Conservative ASPECT_UNION rankings for lawmakers year .
828	261	makes EXCLUSIVEAPR one of people you 'd expect to criticize what liberals see as GOP most notable ASPECT_MEDIA_MOUTHPIECE , Fox ASPECT_NEWS , but 's exactly what ASPECT_EXCLUSIVEAPR did at recent ASPECT_TOWN-HALL_MEETING in Oklahoma .
829	261	When audience ASPECT_MEMBER fretted about going to prison for not buying ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE , Coburn responded , `` intention is not to put in jail .
830	261	makes for good ASPECT_TV on Fox , but is n't intention .
831	261	When discussing ASPECT_DISAGREEMENTS with ASPECT_HOUSE_SPEAKER_NANCY_PELOSI , MEMBER described PELOSI as nice ASPECT_LADY and warned jeering ASPECT_CROWD to be civil and to get news from than one ASPECT_SOURCE : `` Do n't catch yourself being biased by Fox ASPECT_NEWS that is no ASPECT_GOOD .
833	263	Mertex only you would add up stations to try to beat Fox ASPECT_, , HAHAHAHAHA .
834	263	's like saying ASPECT_MICHAL_JACKSON was never one , because if you add up singers records out sold MERTEX ... LOLOnly you ... .
835	265	Hey , but Mertex thinks that if you do n't like Obama , you must have been sucking Bush ASPECT_YING_YANG .
836	265	's not case .
837	265	of us had problems with ASPECT_PAST_REPUBLICANS , however , Obama makes look better day .
839	266	's why and ASPECT_FOLKS are leaning conservative .
840	266	Adding others together , and comparing OTHERS to FOX as whole ASPECT_, is not apples to apples .
841	266	Quit scraping bottom of barrel .
842	267	Albeit VERY ASPECT_SUBJECTIVE_ARGUMENT , I 'm almost afraid to ask ... How did you come to conclusion ?
843	267	-LRB- Please do n't just repeat talking ASPECT_POINTS of your ` ASPECT_POLITICIAN du jour ' -RRB-
844	268	For starters ASPECT_GOVERNMENTAL_EXPERIENCE .
845	268	Governor of state , state requires one to learn necessary ASPECT_SKILLS to deal with far greater ASPECT_SCOPE of issues , and do so in ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_ROLE .
846	268	BELIEVER do not feel Senators make good ASPECT_CANDIDATES nor good ASPECT_PRESIDENTS .
847	268	It was great ASPECT_DISAPPOINTMENT to BELIEVER to see ASPECT_MCCAIN_and ASPECT_OBAMA as candidates .
848	268	BELIEVER am very ASPECT_STRONG believer ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_EXPERIENCE is essential to good ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATES -LRB- and no ASPECT_MAYOR does n't qualify , BELIEVER dispised concept of Guilani even running -RRB- .
849	268	BELIEVER personally feel that assessment is dead on with Obama , likewise BELIEVER think McCain would have been weak ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
850	268	Secondly after Bush , Congress was going to grab ASPECT_CANDIDATES_BALLS back , which CANDIDATES promptly did .
851	268	merely indicated that whoever president would be would not enjoy ASPECT_PRECIEVED_EXECUTIVE_POWERS Bush had .
852	268	For ASPECT_YEARS_CANDIDATES seemed to forget who ASPECT_CANDIDATES were and acted as executive ASPECT_ATM_MACHINE , both ASPECT_SIDES contributed to , both are accountable .
853	268	Couple that with president without ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_EXPERIENCE and you simply creating even weaker ASPECT_EXECUTIVE .
854	268	experienced ASPECT_EXECUTIVE , even from small ASPECT_STATE , would better know how to deal with legistature as separate ASPECT_ENTITY .
855	268	experienced ASPECT_EXECUTIVE would also not allow CREATING to be steamrolled by Congress , which it appears has happened to Obama since ASPECT_DAY_ONE .
856	268	CONGRESS does n't help that Congressional ASPECT_MAJORITY is ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_PARTY , EXECUTIVE only has so ASPECT_ROOM to put ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_FOOT down before ASPECT_EXECUTIVE causes in-fighting .
857	268	Therefore BELIEVER ASPECT_CONCLUSION is that Palin was indeed , after careful ASPECT_ADJUSTMENT 9.4 ASPECT_TIMES more qualified to be president than Obama .
858	269	May I suggest , she is through bottom and is shoveling pure ASPECT_CHIT !!
861	271	You see your ASPECT_HOLDING back again Ron , I thought we have spoken about before .
863	273	ASPECT_DOW_JONES has been climbing ASPECT_STEADILY.REAL-TIME_NEWS_DOW , up 70 ... S&P , up 9 .
865	273	NASDAQ , up 11 By ASPECT_ASSOCIATED_PRESS_BUSINESS_STAFF April 23 , 2010 , 4:15 ASPECT_PM_UPDATED at 5:50 ASPECT_P.M._UNEMPLOYMENT is recovering .
866	273	GDP kept climbing at end of ASPECT_2009HEALTH_CARE_ACCESS to millionsAll in 18 ASPECT_MONTHS - than Bush did in 8 ASPECT_YEARS !
867	273	I do n't think your ASPECT_ASSESSMENT of Obama is accurate .
868	273	You may like Palin , but 18 is not qualified to be ASPECT_PRESIDENT_, ASPECT_NOT now , not ever .
870	274	Ten ASPECT_STROKES .
871	276	I 've asked questions .
872	276	Which ASPECT_ONE are you answering ?
873	276	But , thank you for answering .
874	276	does n't happen often on site .
875	278	Obviously not adept at math .
876	278	Your ASPECT_ASSESSMENT of Obama is no more than echo of Faux ASPECT_NEWS and ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH .
877	278	Republicans in Congress are more dangerous to nation .
878	278	April ASPECT_26 , 2010Younger ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTERS are less enthusiastic about voting in year ASPECT_MIDTERM_ELECTIONS than who are older .
879	278	At time , 18 - to ASPECT_29-YEAR-OLD_VOTERS currently favor ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CANDIDATE in ASPECT_VOTERS_DISTRICTS by ASPECT_12-POINT_MARGIN over ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE .
880	278	I did n't know ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH was ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN son !
882	278	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN needs to stick to trying to be President of PTA .
883	278	is about ASPECT_BWAHAHA_CALIBER .
885	279	Your ASPECT_STATEMENTS sound like from well rehearsed ASPECT_ROBOT\/SHEEPLE of conservative ASPECT_ILK .
886	279	would vote for Palin is in category as ASPECT_PALIN_, uninformed and ASPECT_UNINTELLIGENT .
887	279	It is good that 17 ASPECT_YEAR_OLDS can not vote , from your ASPECT_STATEMENTS , it is apparent that 17 ASPECT_YEAR_OLDS are not able to make intelligent ASPECT_CHOICES .
888	280	Looks like your in `` ASPECT_MINORITY_BUBBA .
890	280	Obama is crashing and burning .
892	281	Another `` ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH from `` fair and ASPECT_BALANCED ?
894	282	You dont need to watch anything , just look up at poll alone , pretty ASPECT_OBVIOUS is n't ?
895	282	82 to 52 .
897	283	Liberals ca n't help poor ASPECT_REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES who only have one ASPECT_STATION_LIBERALS can trust , because STATION tells LIBERALS what LIBERALS like to hear , whether true or ASPECT_NOT .
898	283	So what does REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES mean that Fox ASPECT_NEWS has viewers than ASPECT_CABLE_NEWS_STATIONS ?
899	283	That Republicans\/conservatives are tuned into REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES ?
900	283	That there are Republicans\/Conservatives than ASPECT_LIBERALS_and ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS ?
901	283	That you are going to win election ?
902	283	Ha , ha is right - .
903	283	Your ASPECT_ANALOGY does n't even make sense , but then , of your ASPECT_POSTS , do n't .
904	284	Where did your ASPECT_POLL come from , WND ?
906	284	ASPECT_POLLING_GROUP most recent poll for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BARACK_OBAMA : ASPECT_POLLING_GROUP -LRB- ASPECT_REVERSE_Chronologically -RRB- ASPECT_USA_TODAY\/GALLUP_DATE_April 24-26 , 2010Approval 51 ASPECT_DISAPPROVAL 42
907	285	You are actually citing ASPECT_PF_POLL as evidence of ASPECT_GENERAL_POPULACE ?
908	285	Good ASPECT_LORD .
909	285	No ASPECT_WONDER country is in ASPECT_SHAPE_WONDER 's in .
910	286	I guess 's why Obama beats both ASPECT_PALIN_and ASPECT_ROMNEY in polls ?
912	288	I think we can give prediction weight due your ASPECT_PREDICTION that GDP in ASPECT_4TH_2009 would be negative .
913	289	Well , Obama did say OBAMA would rather be good ASPECT_ONE-TERM_PRESIDENT that mediocre ASPECT_TWO-TERM_PRESIDENT .
914	289	OBAMA 's not doing good ASPECT_TERM , so OBAMA better ASPECT_TAKE ASPECT_OBAMA_ADVICE and skip second .
915	290	Iriemon is right !
916	290	People that post here are actually paying attention to politics so unless PEOPLE believe in socialism , welfare , racist ASPECT_PROGRAMS like Affirmative ASPECT_ACTION , taking no ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY for your ASPECT_ACTIONS , or redistribution of ASPECT_WEALTH_PEOPLE_WONT be voting for Obombya .
917	290	best conservatives can do to rid CONSERVATIVES of moron is to educate masses .
918	290	For ASPECT_EXAMPLE_2 of my best ASPECT_FRIENDS and staunch ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES are always dismayed by ASPECT_FRIENDS_PARENTS_VOTES , FRIENDS always vote Democratic because s way FRIENDS always voted and FRIENDS just don pay attention .
919	290	FRIENDS both attribute ASPECT_FRIENDS_BELIEFS and ideologies to ASPECT_FRIENDS_PARENTS so at ASPECT_HEART_FRIENDS_PARENTS are even more conservative then ASPECT_FRIENDS_ARE and have taught FRIENDS well , FRIENDS just ca n't get ASPECT_FRIENDS_PARENTS to realize that Dems have been hijacked by loony ASPECT_TUNE left .
920	290	Like fact that overwhelming ASPECT_MAJORITY of ASPECT_JEWISH_FAMILIES vote Democratic .
921	290	Educate your ASPECT_NEIGHBORS_CONSERVATIVES and will be well !
922	291	I wish that of ASPECT_GENERAL_PUBLIC would open eyes and start to pay attention .
923	291	way we could end catastrophe year and in 2012 .
924	292	Yep , because look how dandy ASPECT_THINGS went with presidents conservatives educated us to vote for .
925	293	Just to show how senseless ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES are , you misunderstood Irie post .
926	293	IRIE was actually saying majority on Forum are conservatives , and for to take poll seriously , as legitimate ASPECT_MEASURE of country mood , CONSERVATIVES would have to be demented .
927	293	Thanks for confirming what ASPECT_IRIE said .
928	294	Sorry you missed it .
929	294	We did -LRB- ASPECT_OPEN_WE_EYES -RRB- and WE did -LRB- pay attention ASPECT_-RRB- .
930	294	is why WE have ASPECT_NEW_ADMINISTRATION in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE .
931	295	Right , except it 's `` he `` ASPECT_IRIE_= ASPECT_ISLAND slang for alright , as in `` everting be ASPECT_IRIE_`` ASPECT_MON_= ASPECT_MAN .
933	296	Thanks for update - and lesson in ASPECT_ISLAND_TALK .
934	296	I knew mon , but never heard of irie - your ASPECT_POST was right on target , too bad `` ASPECT_RIGHT is n't clear on concept .
935	297	Quite ASPECT_BIT better than ASPECT_SEVERAL_PRESIDENTS were promoted by liberals .
936	297	Obama is taking financial ASPECT_IRRESPONSIBILITY to ASPECT_NEW_HEIGHTS , which does n't seem to concern liberals cried ASPECT_CROCODILE_TEARS over Bush ASPECT_SPENDING , even though Obama spends magnitudes more ... Clinton spent of ASPECT_CLINTON_YEARS neutered by ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS , and even so , CLINTON managed to pass ASPECT_MASSIVE_TAX_INCREASE in ASPECT_CLINTON_COUPLE_YEARS , after promissing ASPECT_CUTS .
937	297	Carter was abysmal ... just ... AWFUL ... ASPECT_JOHNSON_and ASPECT_KENNEDY were no ASPECT_PRIZES ... Even worst offensive ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_, ASPECT_NIXON_, was far outdone by offenses of ASPECT_CLINTON_and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CRONIES .
938	297	Yep ... ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRESIDENTS were just awful !!!
939	298	Sure .
940	298	We can compare Clinton to ASPECT_REAGAN_TIME you want .
941	298	For lessers , let see how Carter stacked up against either ASPECT_BUSH .
942	298	will be fun !
943	298	Clinton - Record low 3.8 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , 22 million ASPECT_JOBS created , ASPECT_STOCK_MARKETS tripling even after 2000 ASPECT_CORRECTION , ASPECT_RECORD_340 billion ASPECT_DEFICIT inherited turned into surplus , longest ASPECT_POST_WAR_BOOM on record , 3.9 per annum ASPECT_GROWTH , decreasing ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_JOBS .
944	298	Just off top of my ASPECT_HEAD .
945	298	Your ASPECT_TURN .
946	299	Despite ASPECT_ULTRA_LIBS like yourself , I still do believe that prosperous and secure ASPECT_AMERICA is possible .
947	302	So so true , how soon forget , loss of power has brought out whiners by droves .
948	302	http:\/\/www.hup.harvard.edu\/catalog\/H...l?show=reviews&quot;He argues that triplet of ` rhetorical ' ASPECT_CRITICISMS -- perversity , futility , and ASPECT_JEOPARDY -- ` has been unfailingly leveled ' by ` ASPECT_REACTIONARIES ' at major progressive ASPECT_REFORM of ASPECT_PAST_300 ASPECT_YEARS -- ASPECT_T._H._MARSHALL identified with advancement of ASPECT_CIVIL_, ASPECT_POLITICAL_and ASPECT_SOCIAL_RIGHTS of citizenship ... Charmingly written , book can benefit ASPECT_DIVERSE_READERSHIP .
949	303	It means that conservatives get out and talk about concerns .
950	303	wo n't sit around and let ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_TURN into socialist ASPECT_GOVERNMENT .
951	303	GOVERNMENT amazing how informed of liberals are .
952	303	Just wait till ASPECT_NOVEMBER_BUDDY , NOVEMBER start of liberal ASPECT_DOWNFALL .
953	303	will not stand for ASPECT_SOCIALIZED_HEALTHCARE .
954	303	Obama will NOT be re-elected .
955	303	ASPECT_OBAMA_approval ASPECT_RATINGS are terrible .
956	303	Also , lot 's of people who voted for OBAMA in 2008 -LRB- lazy ASPECT_PEOPLE -RRB- , will not get out again in 2012 to vote , PEOPLE will rely on others to do things for PEOPLE ... wait , sounds like liberal ASPECT_WAY of life , 's because LOT is .
958	305	That person who puts another ASPECT_COUNTRY before is traitor ?
959	305	I thought COUNTRY was obvious .
960	308	I voted no because there was no `` Hell ASPECT_NO !
962	309	Not exactly , I mean person .
963	309	In what ASPECT_RESPECT does PERSON do .
964	309	Thank you for putting quote below ...
965	310	\*\*\* You 'll most ASPECT_LIKELY_VOTE for obozo ?
966	310	Gee , who would have ever guessed ?
967	310	Notice that you did n't give ASPECT_SOUND_REASONS why you would vote for bozo , but you sure as heck gave lot of ASPECT_RIDCULOUS_REASONS why you would n't support Republican .
968	310	Methinks you fall into category of ` ASPECT_FENCE_SITTER_' just waiting for wind to blow in favorable ASPECT_DIRECTION .
969	310	But you did say one comes as close to possibility as anything , and is bozo may very well get assassinated with ASPECT_CURRENT_MOOD of nation being as MOOD is , and or REPUBLICAN may very well get impeached or forced to resign in desperation to save what little ASPECT_MARXIST_face ASPECT_REPUBLICAN has left .
970	312	You must have been looking at old Faux ASPECT_NEWS_POLL .
971	312	Actually , he is doing much better than conservatives give HE credit for , in spite of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_mess ASPECT_BUSH left country in when BUSH left office .
972	312	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA s ASPECT_JOB_approval ASPECT_RATING_IMPROVED week and now stands at 46 ASPECT_PERCENT , up from ASPECT_RECORD_LOW of 43 ASPECT_PERCENT_APPROVAL in ASPECT_EARLY_APRIL .
973	312	equal of voters disapprove of job ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is doing -LRB- 46 ASPECT_PERCENT_-RRB- .
974	312	And , is from Faux ASPECT_NEWS , now take look at true ASPECT_POLL .
975	312	ASPECT_CNN_POLL : ASPECT_OBAMA_approval ASPECT_RATINGS up Passage of ASPECT_LANDMARK_HEALTH_CARE_BILL appears to have boosted ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BARACK_OBAMA approval ASPECT_RATING , but POLL has not affected OBAMA ASPECT_RE-ELECTION_CHANCES so far , according to ASPECT_NEW_NATIONAL_POLL .
976	312	ASPECT_CNN\/OPINION_RESEARCH_Corporation ASPECT_SURVEY released Monday indicates 51 ASPECT_PERCENT of Americans approve of job Obama is doing in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE , with 48 ASPECT_PERCENT saying they disapprove .
977	312	51 ASPECT_PERCENT_approval ASPECT_RATING is up five ASPECT_POINTS from week ago , before Congress approved ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_reform ASPECT_BILL and president signed legislation into law .
978	312	Four in ten ASPECT_RESPONDENTS say RESPONDENTS disapprove because Obama is too liberal and 6 ASPECT_PERCENT say RESPONDENTS president is not liberal enough .
980	313	If you consider me ASPECT_ULTRA_LIB , no ASPECT_TELLING how far off your ASPECT_SENSE of reasoning ASPECT_SKILLS are .
981	313	ME 'm far from being ultra liberal , ME just do n't like conservatives who claim to be conservative and then practice complete ASPECT_OPPOSITE -LRB- ala Bush ASPECT_-RRB- .
982	313	At least , with Democrat , you are n't expecting ASPECT_EXTREME_CONSERVATIVE , you know what you are getting .
983	313	And , you are right , prosperous and secure ASPECT_AMERICA is possible , but not under ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_ADMINISTRATION - CONSERVATIVES lure problems and ASPECT_ENEMIES .
984	314	Oh , yeah !
985	314	You 'd like ASPECT_NUKELAR_GUY back !
986	315	Judging from comments on your ASPECT_POST , is conservatives do , get out and talk !
987	315	But , they are so uninformed - and THEY keep believing Faux ASPECT_NEWS that THEY are `` winning - wo n't THEY be surprised !
988	315	THEY need to tune NEWS to news instead of believing what Faux ASPECT_NEWS keeps telling THEY .

990	316	fact that I do n't think he 's doing bad ASPECT_JOB ?
991	316	If incumbent is not doing bad , reason to vote for challenger is if you think that challenger will do better .
992	316	Burden is on challenger , who will most likely be hostile toward I ideology .
995	316	Tell I ... which office-holder picks Supreme ASPECT_COURT_NOMINEES ?
996	316	How do nominees last ?
997	316	I think people are ridiculous for not considering ASPECT_SCOTUS_NOMINATIONS as important ASPECT_MOTIVATION behind voting .
998	316	Who is n't ?
999	316	I lean on one ASPECT_SIDE of fence , but until I get facts , I will not jump off .
1000	316	SIDE foolish to jump before knowing what 's on ground .
1001	316	Highly ASPECT_UNLIKELY .
1002	316	But it is possible president might leave office before term is up .
1003	316	No ASPECT_POINT in saying what you 're going to do ASPECT_COUPLE_YEARS from now when you do n't know who is going to be involved .
1004	317	Actually CONTRARY 's quite ASPECT_CONTRARY .
1005	317	Conservatives do research and come up with legitimate ASPECT_POINTS .
1006	317	When liberals are confronted with LIBERALS do things ... 1 .
1007	317	LIBERALS say `` 's not true .
1008	317	LIBERALS deny ASPECT_FACT_.2 .
1009	317	LIBERALS change ASPECT_SUBJECT_.3 .
1010	317	LIBERALS call us racist , sexist , etc. ASPECT_4 .
1011	317	LIBERALS blame Bush ASPECT_.5 .
1012	317	LIBERALS say you are ignorant to get out of argument .
1013	318	And since you did n't refute my ASPECT_CNN_POLL , MY will assume you either did n't read POLL or did n't understand POLL .
1014	318	And you changed subject - is that ASPECT_WAY_REPS\/CONS get out of argument ?
1015	318	So , where is your ASPECT_POLL saying that Obama ratings are going down - do n't post one from back when ASPECT_REPS were making up lies about HCR and getting whole ASPECT_COUNTRY to believe stupid ASPECT_LIES - polls have been replaced now with people figured out sky did n't fall after and world did n't end , like conservatives promised .
1016	319	For reason -LRB- -RRB- Obama does n't have OBAMA ASPECT_HEALTH_scare ASPECT_PROGRAM even beginning in earnest for four ASPECT_YEARS .
1017	319	Funny , I thought we had emergency that ASPECT_OBAMA_PROGRAM could n't be put off even day more .
1018	319	was then , I suppose .
1019	319	There is news about how ASPECT_OBAMA_CARE will actually cost than ASPECT_PROMISED -LRB- surprised -RRB- and how corporations are going to end CORPORATIONS having ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE for ASPECT_CORPORATIONS_EMPLOYEES -LRB- swelling ranks of without , and raising costs even more -RRB- .
1020	319	So if sky is n't falling , SKY because ASPECT_OBAMA_HEALTH_CARE is n't even running yet .
1021	319	Are you ignorant of facts , or just ASPECT_DISINGENUOUS ?
1022	324	So in effect when one stays home unvote went for candidate that wins .
1023	324	In your ASPECT_CASE you helped elect Obama .
1024	324	If you like what OBAMA doing then 's fine for you , if you do n't -LRB- and apparently you do n't by your ASPECT_ABOVE_COMMENT -RRB- then you 're part of problem .
1025	324	I 'm speaking in general about non-voters .
1026	324	vote is important , have fought and died for privilege -LRB- not right -RRB- to vote and election has consequences as has been and continues to be seen .
1027	324	I too hope that true ASPECT_STATESMEN would run for ASPECT_OFFICE_NOT sycophants that 've had to settle for ASPECT_PAST_, ASPECT_YEARS .
1028	324	I suppose problem is that there 's so few of earlier and ASPECT_TOO of latter .
1029	324	would even recognize statemen in ASPECT_TIME_and ASPECT_DAY ?
1030	324	Though I ca n't think of statesmen at time , perhaps might offer ASPECT_NAME_or ASPECT_TWO of .
1031	325	Portray it anyway you want to , I could no ASPECT_STOMACH idea of consenting to ASPECT_MCCAIN_PRESIDENCY than I could to Obama .
1032	325	I made IT very clear to I ASPECT_FELLOW_REPUBLICANS before we even got close to primaries I would never support OBAMA , and would refuse to vote if they chose to nominate OBAMA .
1033	325	I would rather see liberal Democrat ASPECT_REMIND_AMERICANS of how bad THEY are , than put another ASPECT_RINO in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE and have majority of Americans continue to blame WE for what are basically liberal ASPECT_POLICIES .
1034	325	differences between ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_MCCAIN were so minimal to I as to not be worthy of choice .
1035	326	Oh yeah , Obama is world ASPECT_PEACE-MAKER_and ASPECT_PROBLEM-SOLVER !
1037	327	You are correct .
1038	327	Obama got into office with everything but ASPECT_OBAMA_CREDENTIALS , which are non-existent .
1039	327	sheeple of America voted for what they perceived to be coolest from ASPECT_APPLE_, ASPECT_IPRESIDENT , without knowing is was completely defective .
1040	328	Buyer remorse ASPECT_, .
1043	329	what was alternative ?
1044	330	Not given alternative .
1045	331	I 've long been on record as refusing to vote rather ASPECT_THAN to vote for McCain , but does n't mean I do n't think that Obama is worse than McCain would have been .
1046	331	Just ASPECT_VARIOUS_DEGREES of liberal ASPECT_BAD .
1047	332	Was n't even close , IMO .
1048	332	McCain would have been absolute ASPECT_DISASTER .
1049	333	Unsupported partisan ASPECT_RHETORIC really annoys me .
1050	333	Is implying that he should have been able to ?
1051	333	ME seriously doubt that majority of Americans would have supported ASPECT_SINGLE-PAYER_HEALTH_CARE_PACKAGE .
1052	333	Is n't ASPECT_HCR_PACKAGE_BAD enough ?
1053	333	ME actually see as positive and ASPECT_NOT negative .
1054	333	ME do n't want of his ASPECT_CAMPAIGN promises fulfilled .
1055	333	Not completely but certainly major ASPECT_IMPROVEMENT over ASPECT_PRIOR_ADMINSTRATION .
1056	333	ME do n't think is has choice on .
1057	333	HIS inherited government required ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES because of deficits which CHOICE created .
1058	333	Congress has not helped problem by creating ASPECT_NEW_trillion ASPECT_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAM with ASPECT_HCR_BILL .
1059	333	BTW better to raise taxes than to continue with deficits .
1060	333	As has president in history .
1061	333	He had good ASPECT_TEACHER in ASPECT_PRIOR_ADMINSTRATION .
1062	333	is actually Congress which ignores People .
1063	333	president can only sign or veto legislation .
1064	333	is false .
1065	333	As have presidents .
1066	333	False again .
1067	333	Of note who are considered as `` Allies should n't be .
1068	333	While selective in his ASPECT_STATEMENTS , often pulling information from context , is ASPECT_COMMON_PRACTICE for politicians .
1069	333	HIS has not blatantly lied anymore than ASPECT_PRIOR_ADMINSTRATIONS .
1070	333	Did n't vote for ASPECT_OBAMA_or ASPECT_MCCAIN on 2008 because ASPECT_ADMINSTRATIONS were both ASPECT_LOSERS .
1071	333	ME wo n't vote for Obama in 2012 and seriously doubt ME will vote for ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE .
1072	334	Maybe for Republicans politically .
1073	334	's about best ASPECT_CASE you could make there .
1074	334	Both of them would have been bad for country ... But Obama is far , FAR ASPECT_WORSE than McCain would have been , and 's saying lot .
1075	334	Then again , when takes dump in your ASPECT_CHEERIOS , people are n't going to get baggie and weigh size of BAGGIE .
1076	334	PEOPLE both sucked .
1077	335	Hey ASPECT_MAN , do me favor and do n't rule out part yet .
1078	335	ME still have slim ASPECT_HOPES that we can come up with decent to run against YET ...
1079	337	Pretty sure that there were n't ...
1080	338	McCain\/Palin , though McCain would have been rhino which would have meant keeping ASPECT_STATUS_QUO which IMHO would have been preferable to what we have now .
1081	338	Of ASPECT_COURSE_WE_CONSERVATIVES would have preferred candidate more in line of ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN but I do n't see on horizon at time though ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN comes closest and I would vote for woman as well as minority , ` cept Obama .
1082	338	As both ASPECT_SIDES say `` election has consequences .
1083	338	And WE now are paying for consequences of ASPECT_OBOMBA_ADMINISTRATION .
1084	338	How well does work you who did n't vote ?
1085	339	If CHOICE was choice between ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_LIBERAL and Democrat ASPECT_LIBERAL , I prefer to let Democrats take blame for liberal .
1086	339	country is screwed either ASPECT_WAY .
1087	340	What about ASPECT_GREECE_LIBERAL ?
1088	340	Well , to be fair Conservative ASPECT_GREECE_PARTY was just as bad .
1089	341	Republicans had ASPECT_RON_PAUL who they could have selected to be ASPECT_THEY_CANDIDATE in 2008 but instead selected antique who ASPECT_POLITICAL_POSITIONS were reflective of Cold ASPECT_WAR_MENTALITY of 1960 .
1090	341	When Republicans select ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE who is willing to withdraw ASPECT_US_MILITARY from foreign ASPECT_BASES and follow ASPECT_US_CONSTITUTION which specifically establishes that ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT is limited to providing `` for ASPECT_COMMON_DEFENSE ... of ASPECT_UNITED_STATES then STATES might pay attention .
1091	341	As long as ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY supports wars of ASPECT_US_IMPERIALISM around world ASPECT_PARTY will not have ASPECT_STATES_SUPPORT , ever .
1092	342	lesser of two ASPECT_EVILS , McCain .
1093	343	Do n't blame me .
1094	343	ME actively opposed ASPECT_MCCAIN_NOMINATION , and did ASPECT_EVERYTHING_ME could to convince Republicans how awful he would be .
1095	343	Then again , your ASPECT_DEFINITION of `` imperialism is quite out of whack .
1096	343	If U.S. was truly imperialistic , we would outright own half of Europe , and almost of ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST by now .
1097	344	You 'll get over .
1098	344	You 're right .
1099	344	is good he has n't made good on of HE promises .
1100	344	HE should be very disappointing to HE supporters .
1101	344	Have you ever heard of cutting spending , reducing waste ?
1102	344	Obama takes cake on , and OBAMA has years left to solidify OBAMA top ASPECT_SPOT .
1103	344	Which also ignores wishes of People .
1104	344	ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION has stripped ASPECT_SEVERAL_PROVISIONS from ASPECT_PRIOR_ADMINISTRATION which helped control illegal ASPECT_POPULATION .
1105	344	Luckily , states like Arizona are taking things into ASPECT_PEOPLE_HANDS , like PEOPLE should .
1106	344	Once again , Obama takes booby ASPECT_PRIZE .
1107	344	Come on .
1108	344	ASPECT_OBAMA_KISSES_ASS .
1109	344	ASPECT_OBAMA_BOWS to everyone .
1110	344	OBAMA apologizes for `` evil ASPECT_AMERICA .
1111	344	Especially to Muslims .
1112	344	How can you say when you do n't who ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE is ?
1113	345	Even my ASPECT_PARENTS , ASPECT_LIFE-LONG_REPUBLICANS , found PARENTS were unable to support McCain and PARENTS live in Arizona miles from one of McCain homes .
1114	345	MY often use ASPECT_TERM_`` ASPECT_IMPERIALISM to reflect attempts by US to impose ASPECT_POLITICAL_and ASPECT_ECONOMIC_CONTROL over government of ASPECT_SOVEREIGN_STATES and ASPECT_NOT in ASPECT_COMMON_DEFINITION of literally controlling ASPECT_TERRITORY .
1115	345	If nation controls government of ASPECT_SOVEREIGN_STATE_NATION effectively controls territory of state .
1116	346	Carter was n't worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT in US history .
1117	346	` Expert ' ASPECT_SURVEYS usually put CARTER at middle of pack .
1118	346	Surveys of ASPECT_GENERAL_voting ASPECT_PUBLIC_PUT_CARTER at between 11 and ASPECT_13TH_BEST , usually .
1119	346	people who call CARTER ` worst ' ASPECT_PRESIDENT are partisan ASPECT_HACKS on right .
1120	346	-RRB- ASPECT_CARTER 's done better ASPECT_JOB of than presidents in 30 ASPECT_YEARS .
1121	346	-RRB- If your ASPECT_CLAIM had been true , would n't have run counter to your ASPECT_POINT about CARTER ` ramming through ASPECT_LEGISLATION_CARTER wants ' against will of people ?
1122	346	You ca n't have CLAIM both ASPECT_WAYS .
1123	346	Either CARTER imposes ASPECT_CARTER_PREFERENCES over will of people , or CARTER graciously sets aside ASPECT_CARTER_PERSONAL_POLICY_PREFERENCES when will of people becomes clear and does not achieve ASPECT_CARTER_CAMPAIGN promises as result .
1124	346	-LRB- ASPECT_QUOTE_-RRB- ASPECT_CARTER has not been transparent .
1125	346	-LRB- ASPECT_QUOTE_-RRB- More than ASPECT_21ST_century ASPECT_PRESIDENT has been .
1126	346	CARTER has not done so yet , and US 'm not going to let impact US decision until CARTER does or until CARTER makes serious ASPECT_NOISES about doing IMPACT .
1127	346	Aside from , US think we desperately need to balance budget , and way to do is to increase taxes .
1128	346	If means raising taxes for everyone , so be BUDGET .
1129	346	president has done that since ... Carter .
1130	346	Clinton did to reduce scope of government than Reagan or either ASPECT_BUSH ever did .
1131	346	president in 30 ASPECT_YEARS has presided over ASPECT_RECORD_GOVERNMENT_DEFICITS ... except Clinton .
1132	346	US have no ASPECT_REASON to believe Fake ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES will do different .
1133	346	CONSERVATIVES 've demonstrated ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_WILLINGNESS to push through unpopular ASPECT_LEGISLATION_TIMES in past .
1134	346	CONSERVATIVES 're certainly proposing effort to push through lot of legislation US do n't like , often against will of people .
1135	346	No , NO has n't .
1136	346	Bush ASPECT_II and Reagan both did way more to weaken ASPECT_AMERICAN_NATIONAL_SECURITY than Obama has done .
1137	346	Overspending on your ASPECT_MILITARY_WHILE engaging in two ASPECT_WARS at time is not path to ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY .
1138	346	Earning enemies than allies is not path to ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY .
1139	346	Antagonizing ASPECT_ENEMIES whom you were not actually at war with is not path to ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY .
1140	346	Complete ASPECT_SPECULATION .
1141	346	PATH ` shunning ' ASPECT_ENEMIES to insist ENEMIES listen to reason ?
1142	346	If spewing lies to ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE were good ASPECT_REASON not to vote for , we 'd never elect president .
1143	346	REASON will depends on who Republicans put forward for candidate .
1144	346	If ASPECT_PEOPLE_nominate ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN or another Fake ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE , then US probably would vote for Obama again .
1145	346	None of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATES currently being floated by media seem like CANDIDATES 're at worth voting ASPECT_FOR .
1146	347	ASPECT_SEVERAL_BILLS have been analyzed on factcheck.com .
1147	347	In addition to one that passed , there were two ASPECT_BIPARTISAN_BILLS never gained traction in congress , both preceding president bill -LRB- formed during , unproductive ASPECT_PERIOD of time that Obama left congress to make up bill on -RRB- .
1148	347	Both were pretty similar to Obama aside from details .
1149	347	Then there was Boehner bill , which is one considered `` ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_BILL .
1150	347	And , yes , ONE was joke .
1151	347	ONE method of `` expanding coverage was permanent ASPECT_STATE-ADMINISTERED_high-risk ASPECT_POOLS .
1152	347	Completely unsustainable .
1153	347	rest of ONE was based on deregulation that at ASPECT_BEST would have driven costs down slightly for ASPECT_PEOPLE with ASPECT_NON-EMPLOYER-BASED_COVERAGE , but likely also would have decreased quality of service and instituted race for bottom as states compete for ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY_BUSINESS by adopting loosest possible ASPECT_REGULATIONS .
1154	348	Everyone has opinion I suppose .
1155	348	is opinion based on your ASPECT_PART .
1156	348	Saying he 's transparent and has done better ASPECT_JOB than is purely without facts .
1157	348	You better get your ASPECT_FACTS straight on one : ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/ONLINE.WSJ.COM\/ARTICLE\/SB1000...+TAX+INCREASES_YEAH , and Clinton used bonds sold to cover ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY as income for government , thereby ASPECT_OFF-SETTING_NATIONAL_DEBT .
1158	348	See above .
1159	348	Obama is also taking ASPECT_DEFICITS_and ASPECT_SPENDING to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS never even fathomed before .
1160	348	I agree with you here .
1161	348	I do n't know about .
1162	348	You can not simply be neutral and do for injustices in world simply because you may -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- off .
1163	348	I think Obama looks weak in eyes of foreign ASPECT_GOVERNMENTS .
1164	348	True , but folks keep voting in proven ASPECT_LIARS .
1165	348	I may have to write I in on ballot and ASPECT_VOTE for I !
1166	349	presidents have done , not just ASPECT_CLINTON .
1167	349	debt , including SS , was decreased 116 ASPECT_BILLION in 2000 .
1168	350	Should have known , ASPECT_RASMUSSEN_POLL - same as getting poll from Faux ASPECT_NEWS !
1170	351	and Palin being greater of 2 evils ASPECT_TICKET .
1171	352	Right ... because who would want to get polling from accurate ASPECT_SOURCE .
1174	353	Liar Liar ASPECT_PANTS on fire !

1177	354	If I could , yes .
1178	358	There was mention of poll on how Americans feels about taxes , but if you read article , you will have found out that Obama has already signed 25 ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES into law .
1179	359	Worse than crazy ASPECT_JOE_BIDEN ?
1180	359	- LOL !!!!
1181	360	Obama has only been in office for year and half .
1182	360	Wait and see how OBAMA spends\/increases deficit over 2 and half , and destructive ASPECT_LEGISLATION_OBAMA will try to push through .
1183	361	How ASPECT_NATIONAL_DESTRUCTION do you need to see ?
1184	362	Just ASPECT_FEMALE_OBAMA .
1185	362	No ASPECT_DIFFERENCE whatsoever .
1186	363	And Obama is genius ASPECT_RIGHT ?
1187	365	took ASPECT_BACK_SEAT to his pressing ASPECT_ISSUES : Countinued ASPECT_OPEN_BORDERS ... Ongoing wars ... False ASPECT_RECESSSION ... Attacking ASPECT_CAPITALISM .

1191	367	Bought and Paid for ASPECT_.
1192	368	I 'm waiting for depression ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES said we 'd have .
1193	368	When WE get that I 'll consider it for not supporting Obama .
1194	369	Ignorant , baseless , ASPECT_NONSENSE .
1195	370	Oh I see , But Bush MBA from ASPECT_YALE_BUSH had meant BUSH was idiot .
1196	370	You people are ridiculous !
1197	371	But ASPECT_NUMBSKULL_DEMOCRATS said about Bush ASPECT_AND was fact ?
1198	372	I do n't believe Bush graduated ASPECT_CUM_LAUDE from anything , less ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM_LAUDE .
1199	372	Please educate I with link if I am wrong .
1200	373	Putting aside ASPECT_FACT that discussion is about Obama , ASPECT_NOT Bush , please post link where I said Bush was idiot .
1201	373	Otherwise we can safely accredit your ASPECT_POST as another irrelevant and worthless ASPECT_GESTURE .
1202	373	Which ASPECT_POST is in event because is about Obama , ASPECT_NOT Bush .
1203	374	There is as Insolence thru manner .
1204	374	If Obama could be put on ballots as choice for ASPECT_DOG_CATCHER vs. President , I still could n't .
1205	374	I mean , I think I heard tell ASPECT_OBAMA_KINDA got fired when OBAMA worked at Baskin - Robbins .
1206	374	Imagine .
1207	374	guy could n't even handle ASPECT_SCOOPIN_ICE_CREAM .
1208	374	Maybe BASKIN was too physical .
1209	375	I 've `` heard tell kind of false ASPECT_NONSENSE about Obama .
1210	375	Why do you believe `` heard tell rumors ?
1211	375	Is it because you are simply gullible or partisan hack ASPECT_WILLING to credit anything negative about Obama no matter how farfetched or ASPECT_UNRELIABLE source ?
1212	376	Do n't furgit Kerry team of ASPECT_TERRY_MCAULIFFE and ASPECT_BOB_SHRUM ran around inferring ASPECT_BUSH was dummy .
1213	376	Then ASPECT_YALE_BONES_BIDNESS came out and both Bush and ASPECT_KERRY were member of ASPECT_YALE_FRAT .
1214	376	So , Kerry hedged and then finally Boston ASPECT_NEWSPAPER did what ASPECT_KERRY Promised on - Meet ASPECT_PRESS - .
1215	376	being to give ASPECT_KERRY_SERVICE_RECORD_and ASPECT_GRADES , made public .
1216	376	ASPECT_KERRY_DINT .
1217	376	So when came out that Bush had slightly ASPECT_HIGHER_GPA than Kerry .
1218	376	Obama way is bit ASPECT_SHERLOCK_HOLMES .
1219	376	Obama just had ASPECT_OBAMA_educational ASPECT_RECORDS put under seal .
1220	377	I think it highly fair to assume that if Obama was even ASPECT_CUB_SCOUT and managed just one ASPECT_BADGE_BADGE would be ASPECT_BOBCAT_TRAIL_BADGE_-LCB- ASPECT_LAW of ASPECT_PACK_-RCB- and during campaign ASPECT_OPRAH_MUNCHHAUSEN_WOULDA_KICKED-IN .
1221	377	Obama would have been runnin around bragging how OBAMA skipped straight from lowly ASPECT_BOBCAT_TRAIL_BADGE , right up to asst .
1222	377	Administrator of Boy ASPECT_SCOUTS of Hawaii .
1223	377	Confirmation made available by appointment only .
1224	377	Plus lest any'us ` ASPECT_FURGIT that Obama was top ASPECT_SCORER for ASPECT_OCCIDENTAL_COLLEGE , in than ANY'US ASPECT_DREAMS .
1225	377	If 'n ASPECT_'N can git drift .
1226	378	Whose ASPECT_OPRAH_MUNCHHAUSEN ?
1227	378	DRIFT is very ASPECT_DISTANT_DRIFT .
1228	379	Since when does book smart mean politically smart ?
1229	379	Whatever liberals say is fact .
1230	379	I repeat whatever .
1231	379	If conservatives say fact , liberals deny FACT and say 's not true .
1232	379	Nobody is correct except liberals .
1233	379	Who cares ?
1234	379	Bush is more smarter politically .
1235	379	's I care about from I president .
1236	379	Liberals only want president who LIBERALS think is `` cool .
1237	380	Please ... Take unfounded , ASPECT_UNSOURCED_, biased and false ASPECT_CLAIMS elsewhere ... nonsense only works on uneducated and politically retarded ASPECT_FOLKS .
1238	380	Not rest of us ...
1239	381	Yale means jack -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ... He was legacy .
1240	381	HE got in because HE father went there ... LOL
1241	382	I said about politically ASPECT_SMART .
1242	382	Disagree with your ASPECT_OPINION .
1243	383	Perhaps , but since Obama brings up ASPECT_BUSH just about everyday I suppose we are at liberty to bring up Bush as well .
1244	384	Well it 's because everything is Bush fault .
1245	384	Obama has never done anything wrong ... I mean we do live in ASPECT_SOVIET_STATES of Obama .
1246	385	You can bring up irrelevant , immaterial ASPECT_THINGS you want .
1247	385	I 'll point out they are irrelevant and immaterial .
1248	386	As Obama is irrelevant and immaterial except in sense of destroying country .
1249	386	Off with blinders , my ASPECT_FRIEND .
1250	386	Go ahead `` point out as you are led into pits of hell .
1251	387	reason they believe what ASPECT_THEY_POST .
1252	388	Your ASPECT_POST sounds like spewed out of mouth of chief fear ASPECT_MONGER , ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH .
1253	388	sky is falling , sky is falling !
1254	389	lot closer to one than ASPECT_FAILIN_PALIN will ever be !
1255	390	But you 'll suck up BS coming out of Obama ?
1257	391	Palin was neither ASPECT_BOOK smart nor politically smart , yet conservatives think BWAHAHA would be ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL !
1258	391	Too funny !
1259	391	You finally said smart .
1260	391	Yeah , is why he put country in toilet .
1261	391	And correct ASPECT_WAY to say COUNTRY is `` is smarter , not `` is more smarter '' .
1262	391	Must have attended ASPECT_SCHOOL_BUSH did ?
1263	391	's you care about from your ASPECT_PRESIDENT ?
1264	391	PRESIDENT put country in toilet ?
1265	391	figures .
1266	392	You tell us !
1267	392	First , ASPECT_MR._BUSH never was strong ASPECT_STUDENT .
1268	392	BUSH ASPECT_TRANSCRIPT at Yale , leaked to ASPECT_NEW_YORKER , shows that BUSH was solid ASPECT_STUDENT .
1269	392	Although ASPECT_HISTORY_MAJOR , BUSH sampled widely in ASPECT_SOCIAL_SCIENCES and did poorly in ASPECT_POLITICAL_SCIENCE and economics while achieving of BUSH best ASPECT_GRADES -LRB- equivalent of + -RRB- in ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY_and ASPECT_ANTHROPOLOGY .
1270	392	-LRB- ASPECT_ANTHROPOLOGY_CLASS , however , was taught by ASPECT_MARGARET_MEAD that year and was enormously popular because + offered among easiest ASPECT_GRADES at Yale . -RRB-
1271	392	ASPECT_MR._BUSH was not much of student of politics , for BUSH earned 73 in Introduction to ASPECT_AMERICAN_POLITICAL_SYSTEM and 71 in Introduction to International ASPECT_RELATIONS .
1272	392	Few , if any , professors seem to have left mark on BUSH , or BUSH on PROFESSORS .
1273	392	ASPECT_SEVERAL_PROFESSORS who taught BUSH said BUSH had simply been one ASPECT_STUDENT in ASPECT_HUGE_CLASS .
1274	392	As ASPECT_HISTORIAN_JOHN_MORTON_BLUM put ONE , `` BLUM have n't ASPECT_FOGGIEST_RECOLLECTION of BUSH .
1275	392	ASPECT_ERICH_SEGAL , who later met ASPECT_MR._GORE at Harvard and based ASPECT_MAIN_CHARACTER in `` Love ASPECT_STORY partly on GORE , taught classical comedy ASPECT_COURSE that ASPECT_MR._BUSH took , but ASPECT_MR._SEGAL said SEGAL had no ASPECT_MEMORY of SEGAL .
1276	392	transcript indicates that in ASPECT_MR._BUSH ASPECT_FRESHMAN_YEAR , year for which rankings were available , BUSH was in ASPECT_21ST_PERCENTILE of BUSH ASPECT_CLASS , meaning that four-fifths of students had better ASPECT_GRADES than BUSH did .
1278	393	Where are Obama transcripts ?
1279	394	Oh , I guess you do n't believe that he graduated ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM_LAUDE ?
1280	394	Wikipedia : ASPECT_OBAMAHARVARD_LAW_SCHOOL_THREE-YEAR_PROGRAM_CAMBRIDGE , ASPECT_MASSACHUSETTS_J.D._MAGNA_CUM laude President , ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_REVIEWOH , I guess you do n't believe ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM_LAUDE require ASPECT_HIGH_GRADE_POINT_AVERAGE ?
1281	394	ASPECT_HONORS_DESIGNATION_REQUIRED_OVERALL_GPASUMMA_CUM laude 3.90 ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM laude 3.70 ASPECT_CUM laude 3.50 ASPECT_OH , figures !
1282	395	Wikipedia does not = transcripts .
1283	396	Palin would be better ASPECT_PRESIDENT than Obama .
1284	396	You liberals ca n't really come up with legitimate ASPECT_REASONS why she would fail .
1285	396	You just do n't like way SHE looks , acts , etc. .
1286	396	If country was in toilet when Bush left , COUNTRY 's in sewer now thanks to Obama .
1287	396	I would like to know what has gotten better since Obama has been in office ?
1288	398	Actually , I have to disagree with you on one .
1289	398	I 've heard liberals upset with Obama for not being liberal enough .
1290	398	Oddly enough , of liberal criticisms about Bush were because LIBERAL was TOO liberal on things ... especially spending .
1291	398	But logic was never strong ASPECT_SUIT ...
1292	399	And you still think Obama is ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL ?
1294	400	He ordered ASPECT_FEDERAL_AGENCIES to find ASPECT_SPENDING_CUTS and promote transparency , HE reduced secrecy in ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_RECORDS , HE restored ASPECT_FULL_ADHERENCE to Freedom of ASPECT_INFORMATION_ACT , HE increased ASPECT_PRESS_CONFERENCES and ASPECT_TOWN_HALLS , HE blocked lobbyists from accessing ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE or hiring ASPECT_HOUSE_STAFFERS , and HE limited ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE_SALARIES , saved or created million ASPECT_DIRECT_or ASPECT_INDIRECT_JOBS with ASPECT_STIMULUS_PROGRAM , HE saved auto ASPECT_INDUSTRY , financial ASPECT_INDUSTRY and ASPECT_HOUSING_MARKET , HE got banks to pay back big ASPECT_BUCKETS of ASPECT_BAILOUT_MONEY , HE got markets up 50 ASPECT_PERCENT in matter of months , HE turned corner on ASPECT_MONTHLY_unemployment ASPECT_RATES , HE stopped slide in GDP , and HE trimmed budget ASPECT_DEFICIT by 200 ASPECT_BILLION year , gave ASPECT_FOOD_and support and ASPECT_HEALTH_COVERAGE to unemployed ASPECT_, HE helped people to save ASPECT_PEOPLE_MORTGAGES , HE expanded ASPECT_STUDENT_LOANS and ASPECT_LOAN_REFINANCING , HE expanded loans to small ASPECT_BUSINESSES , HE established ASPECT_HOMEOWNERS_CREDIT , and regardless of lies spewed by HE enemies , HE cut taxes .
1295	400	Along way HE fixed up neglected roads , ASPECT_BRIDGES_and ASPECT_POWER_PLANTS , and funded ASPECT_SCHOOL_construction and ASPECT_INTERNET_ACCESS , helped round up crooks who got into ASPECT_ECONOMIC_TROUBLE .
1296	400	HE ended ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS for firms outsource jobs ; HE prevented ASPECT_TAX_CHEATS from hiding CROOKS ASPECT_MONEY overseas and finally persuaded ASPECT_SWISS_BANKERS to expose crooked ASPECT_DEPOSITORS ; HE reformed ASPECT_CREDIT_card ASPECT_INDUSTRY , HE ended protection of predatory ASPECT_CREDIT_card ASPECT_FIRMS , and HE signed ASPECT_ANTI-FRAUD_BILL , won ASPECT_NOBEL_PRIZE for getting world back on track , on ASPECT_ARMS_PROLIFERATION , ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST_peace ASPECT_PROCESS , relations with ASPECT_MUSLIM_WORLD , climate ASPECT_CHANGE , ASPECT_WAR_CRIMES , torture , and diplomacy .
1297	400	HE reengaged with world ASPECT_LEADERS and international ASPECT_COMMUNITY , HE improved America s image internationally , HE repaired bilateral ASPECT_RELATIONS with dozens of countries , HE persuaded Pakistan to go after Taliban , HE improved OUR Cuba ASPECT_POLICY , and HE freed prisoners in ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA and Myanmar ; showed HE balls by putting troops in Afghanistan and improving Afghanistan ASPECT_POLICY ; HE killed ASPECT_SOMALI_PIRATES , freed ASPECT_AMERICAN_CAPTAIN , and put Navy in ASPECT_SOMALI_WATERS ; pulled ASPECT_TROOPS out of Iraq and stopped ASPECT_STOP-LOSS_SYSTEM , HE got ASPECT_BODY_ARMOR for troops , HE increased pay , benefits , ASPECT_MEDICAL_CARE_and ASPECT_HOUSING for ASPECT_TROOPS_and ASPECT_VETERANS , HE hired ASPECT_MILITARY_SPOUSES ; HE improved conditions at ASPECT_MILITARY_HOSPITALS , HE stopped ASPECT_MEDIA_BLACKOUT on ASPECT_WAR_CASUALTIES and on arrival of coffins at ASPECT_DOVER_AFB , and HE paid to bring families of soldiers to Dover when coffins arrived ; stopped torture , and HE directed closure of Guantanamo and ASPECT_SECRET_PRISONS in Europe ; cleaned up HE predecessor s ASPECT_BLANK-CHECK_defense ASPECT_SPENDING : HE overhauled ASPECT_MILITARY_PROCUREMENT , HE blocked ASPECT_NO-BID_defense ASPECT_CONTRACTS , and HE phased out unnecessary ASPECT_MILITARY_PROGRAMS like ASPECT_F22_and ASPECT_MISSILE_DEFENSE ; expanded ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE for 4 million ASPECT_CHILDREN , expanded ASPECT_VACCINATION_PROGRAMS , cut ASPECT_DRUG_COSTS for seniors , saved hundreds of millions by allowing Medicare to negotiate ASPECT_DRUG_PRICES , led fight against ASPECT_SWINE_FLU , and stopped pharmacists from cutting women off from ASPECT_BIRTH_CONTROL .
1298	400	So , yeah , I think HE can hack COMMUNITY .
1299	401	With couple of exception he has mentioned of above , but in reality HE has accomplished none of ABOVE .
1301	402	In what ASPECT_UNIVERSE .
1304	402	Because ? ASPECT_SURE as hell was n't one ASPECT_!!!
1305	407	Now , is informed ASPECT_PERSON .
1306	408	Well , if you 're referring to Obama and 2012 , OBAMA is no ASPECT_SHOO-IN by stretch of imagination .
1307	408	You should remember in 2008 man had no ASPECT_RECORD to run on , people had unrealistic ASPECT_BELIEF in MAN , MAN may have been destined to be black ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
1308	408	But now truth about MAN has come out , MAN has record , ASPECT_MAN_radical ASPECT_AGENDA has been exposed and ASPECT_WHITE_GUILT is no longer reason to vote for MAN .
1309	408	More and more Americans are recognizing how ASPECT_BAD MAN is for us to continue to live ASPECT_AMERICAN_DREAM , to have freedoms US took for granted and proper ASPECT_ROLE of ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT .
1310	408	`` If economy is improving or humming along ?
1311	408	And just ASPECT_WHAT has or is MAN doing to make that reality ?
1312	408	Apparently you 're still employed , have n't lost your ASPECT_HOME -LRB- or perhaps sucking at teat of government -RRB- otherwise you 're in ASPECT_LA-LA_LAND .
1313	408	`` ASPECT_UNEMPLOYEMENT_RATE is decreasing or low ?
1314	408	Have we come to point that WE accept ASPECT_NEAR_10 unemployment ASPECT_RATE as ASPECT_NEW_NORM ?
1315	408	How can still believe in unman is beyond my human ASPECT_UNDERSTANDING .
1316	408	UNMAN kind of like trying to grasp size of universe , mind can not take UNMAN in .
1317	408	But reality will sink in , so there is hope for you and others of your ASPECT_ILK .
1318	409	reason we 're stuck is because WE continue to vote buffoons into office .
1319	409	WE think ASPECT_WE_REPRESENTATIVE should be kept while thinking that REASON guy representatives that need to be voted out .
1320	409	Once WE get past mindset , then perhaps ASPECT_REPRESENTATIVES 'll get ONCE and start representing people .
1321	409	There is chance for ASPECT_THIRD_PARTY_or ASPECT_TWO , but CHANCE has to start at ASPECT_LOCAL_LEVEL and grow into regional , then perhaps ASPECT_NATIONAL_LEVEL .
1322	409	failure is FAILURE backward .
1323	409	parties try to start at top , does n't work and even if TOP might that party would be minority among minority in congress and have little ASPECT_SWAY .
1324	409	Countries where exists now you 'll notice that PARTIES have to form coalitions to win and run country .
1325	409	is both good and ASPECT_BAD as coalitions tend to fall apart and country undergoes change without hope of stability .
1326	409	Hey , kind of like `` Change YOU can believe in .
1327	410	person need only live short ASPECT_PERIOD of time to realize that grades do not measure intellect , ability to take test .
1328	410	people I have met who were students were woefully lacking in logic and ASPECT_BASIC_COMMON_SENSE .
1329	411	Blah Blah ASPECT_BLAH , if you are alleging that it was not ASPECT_WIDESPREAD_Democrat ASPECT_OPINION that Bush was idiot , then we know who is discredited here .
1330	412	And Obama grades mean as well .
1331	412	Glad you finally see point !
1332	413	Which makes your ASPECT_POSTS , ironically , irrelevant and ASPECT_IMMATERIAL .
1333	414	Is Palin ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE ?
1334	414	Was she ever ?
1335	414	Compare ASPECT_SHE to Biden and I think you will see at least even ASPECT_MATCH !
1336	415	's why do n't support Obama .
1337	416	Yeah , and of posters on forum prove that .
1339	417	Please , please , do not insult Palin by comparing her to ASPECT_BIDEN_MISFIT .
1340	418	republicans are against lowering deficit because REPUBLICANS are against increasing ASPECT_TAXES .
1341	418	We ca n't have DEFICIT both ASPECT_WAYS .
1342	418	ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES are necessary to lowering deficit .
1343	419	Biden is better educated and more experienced and has never quit ASPECT_HIGH_LEVEL_JOB in middle of ASPECT_BIDEN_COMMITMENT .
1344	419	JOB 's not Palin who should be insulted .
1345	420	No , no , no. .
1346	420	Democrats are against lowering deficit because NO ASPECT_ARE against reducing ASPECT_SPENDING .
1347	420	DEFICIT spending needs to be reduced to lower deficit .
1348	420	Increasing taxes does not help lower deficit for money will be spent on else .
1349	420	never ending ASPECT_CYCLE .
1350	421	Biden greatest ASPECT_EXPERIENCE is ASPECT_BIDEN_TENDENCY to be buffoon , BIDEN joke minute .
1351	421	BIDEN never had ASPECT_HIGH_LEVEL_JOB .
1352	421	Sure ASPECT_BIDEN filled positions , but not job so there is to quit except being butt of joke .
1353	421	Biden ca n't be insulted , BIDEN is insult .
1354	422	ASPECT_LOL_WUT ?!
1355	422	There are people who are against reducing ASPECT_SPENDING ?
1356	422	Seriously you live in another ASPECT_UNIVERSE .
1357	422	No ASPECT_ONE is against reducing ASPECT_SPENDING .
1358	422	PEOPLE simply ca n't agree on what to cut .
1359	422	Democrats would like to see defense ASPECT_BUDGETS cut and republicans would like to see ASPECT_SOCIAL_PROGRAMS cut .
1360	422	Both have lot of waste in BOTH but fact is we are paying for BOTH ASPECT_NOW_and ASPECT_WE can spend thousand ASPECT_YEARS debating what needs to be cut or WE can actually pay for what WE are spending now and sort NOW out quicker when people get pissed at how ASPECT_HIGH_PEOPLE_TAXES are .
1361	423	ASPECT_LMAO_SENATOR been ASPECT_US_SENATOR since 70s .
1362	423	What hell are you talking about ?!
1363	424	You of ASPECT_PARALLEL_UNIVERSE , thinking that Democrats want to reduce spending .
1364	424	You 've made YOU day ... YOU say cut ASPECT_FEDERAL_SPENDING except that which is necessary to to ASPECT_HEALTH_and ASPECT_SECURITY of nation .
1365	424	And YOU do n't mean ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE .
1366	425	You think being Senator is job ?
1367	425	What hell are you thinking ?
1368	426	And what is unnecessary .
1369	426	There have been polls on .
1370	426	Of big ASPECT_SPENDING_ITEMS not ASPECT_ONE can gain over 20 ASPECT_&#37;_APPROVAL for cutting .
1371	426	Meanwhile deficit is getting higher and higher .
1372	426	need to pay bill now .
1373	426	Not wait until bill gets smaller .
1374	427	There is just no ASPECT_TALKING to people like you ...
1375	428	Is there on planet who does n't want to save money ?
1376	428	's just ridiculous ASPECT_NOTION that you think there are people do n't want to save money .
1377	429	They are paying bill now , ever hear of taxes and government printing money .
1378	429	Your ASPECT_RESPONSE is kind of like one about illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRATION .
1379	429	I 'll paraphase : Meanwhile of illegals is getting higher and higher .
1380	429	We need to stop flow of illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRANTS now .
1381	429	Not wait until numbers get higher .
1382	429	See what I mean ?
1383	430	You 're correct .
1384	430	People who 've had job know what I mean .
1385	430	And you do n't think Senators know SENATORS have cushy ASPECT_POSITION , terrific ASPECT_BENEFITS , ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE you 'll never have , pension beyond description , expenses paid , and on on .
1386	430	I know you 're struggling to make sense of but to tell you truth , left in I wallet now is cents , not ASPECT_SENSE .
1387	431	Again you are assuming ASPECT_DEMOCRATS do not support securing border .
1388	431	We do .
1389	431	WE just do n't support kicking people who have already established ASPECT_LIFE_and ASPECT_FAMILY here out .
1390	432	US guarantee you 've never had job held as ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY as ASPECT_US_SENATOR .
1391	433	Wanting to save and actually saving are two different ASPECT_THINGS .
1392	433	Guess how ASPECT_FAMILIES can save now ?
1393	433	How even have job , home , hope ?
1394	433	No , times have changed .
1395	433	unending ASPECT_POOL of money ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_USE to have -LRB- ASPECT_MONEY_MIND you -RRB- is no ASPECT_LONGER .
1396	433	POOL credit have yet government still continues to spend , spend , spend into oblivion .
1397	433	Now if you have access to ASPECT_GRAVY_TRAIN , please share NOW with .
1398	434	I agree .
1399	434	But we are talking about wants .
1400	434	Not ASPECT_DOS .
1401	434	Both ASPECT_REPUBLICANS_and ASPECT_DEMOCRATS have wants for what to cut .
1402	434	But both fail to make cuts .
1403	434	republicans consistently fail to make cuts to .
1404	434	and ASPECT_EVERYONE will consistently fail to make cuts for as ASPECT_AS we are unwilling to make sacrifice for what WE are already spending and raise taxes to cover SACRIFICE .
1405	434	As long as Americans can still go shopping at ASPECT_MALL_REPUBLICANS do n't really care about cutting spending .
1406	434	Like sad ... there is n't ASPECT_SINGLE_big ASPECT_TICKET_ITEM that ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE broadly support cutting .
1407	434	gains over 20 ASPECT_&#37;_SUPPORT for cutting .
1408	434	If we raised taxes and put fire under ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUTTS you can be sure WE will pick to cut and fast .
1409	435	No , I do n't think Democrats want to secure border , NO want ASPECT_NEW_potential Democrat ASPECT_VOTERS .
1410	435	So we should just willy-nilly let cross over to establish ASPECT_LIFE_and ASPECT_FAMILY here without regard to whether LIFE legal or ASPECT_NOT .
1411	435	NO knew if beforehand that CROSS was wrong , but NO came anyway .
1412	435	Kind of like criminal knowing what NO are doing is wrong but not expecting to get caught and suffer consequence .
1413	435	Perhaps you want to spend your hard ASPECT_EARNED -LRB- or is hardly earned -RRB- ASPECT_MONEY on NO , but I do n't .
1414	435	I preference to to help ASPECT_AMERICAN_CITIZENS and legal ASPECT_IMMIGRANTS who have need .
1415	435	You 're emotional , suggesting we want to kick people out .
1416	435	No , WE want NO to follow laws of land as you -LRB- I think -RRB- and I do .
1417	435	So stop with ASPECT_CRYBABY_TACTIC and be man wants to ensure ASPECT_HEALTH_and ASPECT_SECURITY of nation .
1418	435	No different than what country would want and expect .
1419	436	They are raising taxes as we write and fire THEY are putting under ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUTTS is what is stemming tide of continued wasteful ASPECT_SPENDING .
1420	436	No longer is spending ASPECT_CATCH_PHRASE , PHRASE holding line .
1421	436	You want your ASPECT_TAXES raises , go for PHRASE .
1422	436	As for me ME want spending cut and cut NOW !
1423	436	representatives are starting to get message and you see how of REPRESENTATIVES are leaving congress and losing primaries .
1424	436	Yep , as YEP should be .
1425	436	You raise taxes , you increase spending , YEP as simple as .
1426	437	's gotta be backward ass ASPECT_CONSPIRACY theroy 've ever heard lol .
1427	437	How hell are illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRANTS going to vote ?
1428	437	IMMIGRANTS ca n't even become ASPECT_NATURALIZED_CITIZENS if IMMIGRANTS are illegal .
1429	437	And what about ASPECT_AMERICAN_citizen ASPECT_CHILDREN of illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRANTS ?
1430	437	Are we supposed to rip CHILDREN ASPECT_PARENTS away from PARENTS ?
1431	437	fail to see how 'm being emotional .
1432	437	You 're one calling THAT cry ASPECT_BABY_LOL .
1433	437	fact is yes PARENTS broke law but PARENTS 're here .
1434	437	And of PARENTS have been here for decades .
1435	437	've established life here and LIFE completely inhumane to relocate to place are no longer familiar with .
1436	437	Especially if have children who are ASPECT_AMERICAN_CITIZENS .
1437	437	mean hey if MANY 've been here for ASPECT_YEAR_or two then ASPECT_YEAH , deport .
1438	437	But if 've been here for years or have children here then what 's point .
1439	437	Clearly are n't hurting by being here .
1440	438	I want to cut spending too .
1441	438	But I 'm telling you it 's not going to happen .
1442	438	You can say you want to you want but IT 's not going to happen .
1443	438	No ASPECT_ONE cuts spending when they are living comfortable ASPECT_LIFE .
1444	438	People only cut spending when PEOPLE are forced to .
1445	438	is why Obama ASPECT_PAY-GO_LAW is good ASPECT_LAW .
1446	438	If we pass ASPECT_SPENDING_BILL then there should be revenue goes with BILL .
1447	438	If WE are n't making sacrifices for ASPECT_WE_HIGH_SPENDING then there is no ASPECT_INCENTIVE to cut spending .
1448	438	So you can ride your ASPECT_HIGH_HORSE all you want pretending you 're one who wants to cut spending .
1449	438	When in ASPECT_FACT_EVERYONE wants to cut spending .
1450	438	WE just ca n't agree on what to cut because none of WE are actually sacrificing enough to feel WE need to cut things WE actually want to be able to spend money on .
1451	438	Let I ask you .
1452	438	I want to see cut in defense ASPECT_SPENDING by 50 .
1453	438	Would you support cut ?
1454	440	You 're repeating yourself .
1455	440	You assume we support kicking ASPECT_PEOPLE out of here .
1456	440	Again , PEOPLE knew what PEOPLE did was wrong before PEOPLE did it , sounds like ASPECT_PLANNED_CRIME to me .
1457	440	Suffer consequences .
1458	440	Besides PEOPLE have home in ASPECT_LAND_PEOPLE came from .
1459	440	How about PEOPLE establishing ASPECT_LIFE_and ASPECT_FAMILY in ASPECT_PEOPLE_HOMELAND .
1460	440	one for one ASPECT_SWAP .
1461	440	We keep one ASPECT_ILLEGAL , country will deal with you .
1462	441	Sure I have .
1463	441	ASPECT_LIFE_and ASPECT_DEATH for matter .
1464	441	They care more about ASPECT_THEY_LIFE_and ASPECT_PURSUIT of happiness than you assume THEY care about .
1465	441	ASPECT_TYPICAL_rich ASPECT_REPRESENTATIVES care about poor .
1466	441	Do n't make I laugh .
1468	442	Democrats want to legalize illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRANT , is how DEMOCRATS 'll get vote .
1469	442	There are , ASPECT_AMERICAN_CHILDREN living around world to ASPECT_NON-AMERICAN_PARENTS .
1470	442	What 's big ASPECT_DEAL ?
1471	442	problem is parents came here illegally , remain here illegally , children will do just fine with CHILDREN ASPECT_PARENTS elsewhere .
1472	442	Ok , I see little ASPECT_MOVEMENT on your ASPECT_PART .
1473	442	How heck are we suppose to know how PARENTS lived here , PARENTS 're illegal , no ASPECT_DOCUMENTATION ?
1474	442	Obviously are hurting others here , look at rise in crime ASPECT_RATES in areas swarming with illegals .
1475	442	I suppose you are ok with since you probably live in ASPECT_WHITE_NEIGHBORHOOD .
1476	443	ASPECT_LIFE_or ASPECT_DEATH of hundreds of millions of people ?
1477	444	I do n't want government to force I -LRB- or tell I -RRB- how to spend I money , I certainly do n't want to see taxes rise to help government spend money .
1478	444	You have GOVERNMENT backwards .
1479	444	No ASPECT_MONEY , no ASPECT_SPENDING .
1480	444	How about ?
1481	444	Defense is indeed ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT should be spending money on .
1482	444	DEFENSE about keeping ASPECT_COUNTRY_safe and ASPECT_SECURE .
1483	444	Aside from ASPECT_SPECIFIC_DOMESTIC_ISSUES government should not be in business of providing that which amounts to welfare or feel good ASPECT_SPENDING so they can stay in office .
1484	444	Go back , read Constitution and documents of ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHERS .
1485	444	FATHERS would be aghast at how bloated bureaucracy is .
1486	444	I sacrifice enough , about ASPECT_TIME_OTHERS who have n't start .
1487	445	I just gave you area to cut spending and you turned AREA ASPECT_DOWN !
1488	445	Why are you against cutting spending !
1489	446	You referring to Senators ?
1490	446	I needed good ASPECT_LAUGH .
1492	447	You only address part of my ASPECT_RESPONSE .
1493	447	MY did not say MY would n't support defense ASPECT_SPENDING , but 50 , 's what enemies would like .
1494	447	MY mentioned where MY think spending should be .
1495	447	But apparently you like to be taxed and do n't care about continued ASPECT_SPENDING .
1496	447	Mighty ASPECT_BIG of you to spend ASPECT_MY_MONEY too .
1498	448	Senators make decisions affect lives of millions of Americans .
1499	448	Bad ASPECT_DECISIONS on congress part could lead to complete ASPECT_DISASTERS if done incorrectly .
1500	448	SENATORS have responsibility than you ever did .
1501	449	Cutting defense by 50 would mean would be spending more on defense than 8 ASPECT_COUNTRIES combined .
1502	449	I think 'll be fine .
1503	450	Yes THEY do .
1504	450	It is they approved actions in Afghanistan , Iraq and elsewhere .
1505	450	Americans have died as result of ASPECT_THEY_ACTIONS so RESULT 's on THEY , not me .
1506	450	THEY make bad ASPECT_DECISIONS_EVERYDAY are complete ASPECT_DISASTER , note ASPECT_NEW_HEALTH_CARE_BILL , rampant ASPECT_SPENDING , bankruptcy ASPECT_THEY are leading us to -LRB- although ME think US 're already there -RRB- .
1507	450	You go Obama -LRB- ex-Senator , soon to be ASPECT_EX-PRESIDENT_-RRB- .
1508	451	We 'd also be cutting ASPECT_WE_THROATS , would n't have to wait for terrorists to do so .
1509	451	ASPECT_WE_DEFENSE is what keeps ASPECT_WE_safe and ASPECT_SECURE .
1510	451	You willing to give up for lavish ASPECT_SPENDING on welfare ASPECT_AND ?
1511	452	Cutting defense even by 50 would not do whole ASPECT_LOT for us , apart from fact that LOT is one of things left in budget that ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT is actually constitutionally mandated to provide .
1512	452	US ASPECT_SECURITY_SPENDING for FY2010 is 844 ASPECT_BILLION , and only part of is defense ASPECT_SPENDING .
1514	453	strong ASPECT_MILITARY\/NATIONAL_DEFENSE is what maintains way of life .
1515	453	Sure ASPECT_ECONOMY sucks , but ECONOMY sucks everywhere right now .
1516	454	biggest ASPECT_ENEMY right now does n't even have ASPECT_AIR_FORCE .
1517	454	idea of good ASPECT_STRATEGY is strapping bomb to chest and walking into mall .
1518	454	IDEA absolute ASPECT_PARANOIA to think spending than 8 top ASPECT_MILITARY_COMBINED is not enough .
1519	454	Absolute ASPECT_PARANOIA .
1520	455	Defense ASPECT_COUNTS for 19 of budget .
1521	455	DEFENSE ASPECT_2ND_largest ASPECT_AREA of spending .
1522	455	DEFENSE 's not end solution but to pretend DEFENSE would n't have serious ASPECT_IMPACT on budget is ridiculous .
1523	457	, plus getting out of ASPECT_IRAQ_and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN , would cut expenditures by about 450 ASPECT_BILLION year .
1524	457	's lot , maybe even whole ASPECT_LOT .
1525	458	There wo n't be guy -LRB- or ASPECT_GAL_-RRB- .
1526	458	You 've excluded everyone .
1527	459	ASPECT_CBO_NUMBERS for 2020 : ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.CBO.GOV\/SOCIAL_PROGRAMS account for 48 , defense ASPECT_MERE_15 .
1528	460	ASPECT_SOCIAL_PROGRAMS benefit economy .
1529	461	To extent , but without strong ASPECT_DEFENSE security would be compromised and you can forget about ASPECT_SOCIAL_PROGRAMS for money will go to things wo n't benefit economy or people .
1530	461	Look around world , see where in totalitarian ASPECT_GOVERNMENTS where money goes .
1531	461	Defense , little left for people .
1532	461	So in light , you can see defense ASPECT_SPENDING is negligible .
1533	462	Are you sure he 's going to run ?
1534	463	Are you saying you do n't think we 'd be secure ASPECT_SPENDING more than 8 top ASPECT_MILITARIES combined ?
1535	463	Because 's how ASPECT_WE 'd be spending if WE cut defense ASPECT_SPENDING in half .
1536	463	I mean do WE really need as bases in Europe as WE have ?
1537	463	No ASPECT_ONE in Europe is ASPECT_WE_ENEMY .
1538	464	Great ASPECT_POST , It 's not Obama is lacking in ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE_AREA , another perfect ASPECT_EXAMPLE is that ASPECT_NIT_WIT_HOLDER .
1539	465	Maybe if you were talking about ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL .
1540	465	But certainly college .
1541	465	And certainly not ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_SCHOOL .
1542	465	You have to be very well rounded ASPECT_PERSON intellectually to get through with 4.0 .
1543	466	I would say we would not be secure .
1544	466	WE are not in Europe and ASPECT_SOUTH_KOREA and elsewhere because ENEMIES are ASPECT_WE_ENEMIES .
1545	466	WE are there for purposes .
1546	466	Including having ASPECT_WE_FORCES around world ready for defending ASPECT_WE_home ASPECT_COUNTRY from afar to keep ASPECT_WE_ENEMIES away and also for defense of countries that ASPECT_WE_COUNT as allies .
1547	466	Personally , I 'd like to see ASPECT_WE_ARMED_FORCES_RETURN to America and have powerful ASPECT_NAVY_and ASPECT_LONG-RANGE_AIR_FORCE .
1548	466	strong ASPECT_MISSLE_DEFENSE -LRB- and offense , if needed -RRB- and reliance on ASPECT_SATELLITE_TECHOLOGY .
1549	466	I 'd like to say DEFENSE 'd be nice to rely on allies who have powerful ASPECT_MILITARY_BUT at time is not case and of allies are falling prey to radical ASPECT_ISLAM_and ASPECT_NEW_GOVERNMENT_STRUCTURES will turn against WE , as have already .
1550	466	You are naive if you think letting down ASPECT_WE_DEFENSE will be good for ASPECT_AMERICAN_and ASPECT_DEFENSE people .
1551	466	You are falling for lies of ASPECT_LEFT_and ASPECT_WE_ENEMIES .
1552	467	I thought `` very well rounded ASPECT_PERSON included ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE_, ASPECT_EXPERIENCE_and good ASPECT_JUDGMENT as well as semblence of strength .
1553	467	You do n't obtain characteristics from college , certainly not ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_SCHOOL .
1554	468	I did n't say you gain them .
1555	468	I said it implies you have THEM .
1556	468	You do n't get through ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_SCHOOL with 4.0 with no ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE .
1557	469	I said about letting defense ASPECT_DOWN .
1558	469	I want defense more efficient .
1559	469	do n't have ASPECT_SINGLE_ENEMY would fight in Europe .
1560	469	Not ASPECT_ONE .
1561	469	biggest and capable ASPECT_ENEMY is ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA .
1562	469	ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA is not going to fight in Europe .
1563	469	And if enemy in Europe arrises have allies there would allow to build base at time .
1564	469	ASPECT_EUROPEAN_BASES are but ASPECT_WW2 and Cold ASPECT_WAR_RELICS .
1565	469	ALLIES are useless ASPECT_WASTES of money .
1566	470	4.0 with no ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE ?
1567	470	Have you actually ever met ASPECT_HARVARD_SCHOOL_LAW_SCHOOL_GRAD ?
1568	470	If so , you 'd eat your ASPECT_WORDS .
1569	470	Look around , especially at ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION .
1570	470	No ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE to be found .
1571	471	I did n't say ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_GRAD .
1572	471	I said ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM laude 4.0 ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_GRAD .
1573	471	They are best of best .
1574	471	who can do is EXTREMELY well rounded and intelligent .
1575	472	You are n't going to get that thinks `` C-student-Bush is intelligent ASPECT_PRESIDENT we 've ever had , and `` D-in-economics-Palin who does n't know squat is ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL , to admit that Obama is not only intelliginet and eloquent , but highly qualified to be President and doing good ASPECT_JOB at JOB .
1576	472	JOB just wo n't happen .
1577	472	Party of `` no wo n't allow NO .
1578	473	Nobody is nocking Obama education .
1579	473	Frankly , I do n't care .
1580	473	If president was ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_DROPOUT but did good ASPECT_JOB , who cares ?
1581	475	To be honest we must segregate what is within authority of Office of President and what is not .
1582	475	Not within power of president .
1583	475	Not exclusively within power of president .
1584	475	Not within power of president .
1585	475	Within power of president .
1586	475	Not within power of president .
1587	475	Within power of president .
1588	475	Not within power of president .
1589	475	Not within power of president .
1590	475	Not within power of president .
1591	475	It is true that no ASPECT_PRESIDENT or ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE should make promises which they has no ASPECT_AUTHORITY to keep but Americans should be smart enough to know what president does and does not have authority to do .
1592	475	Listing ASPECT_ITEMS which we know president has no ASPECT_AUTHORITY reflects either ASPECT_IGNORANCE or partisan ASPECT_POLITICS which is n't concerned with issues .
1593	476	Not ASPECT_FACT , opinion .
1594	476	By what standards do you make assumption ?
1595	476	standards of have ASPECT_VESTED_INTEREST in perpetrating acclaim ?
1596	476	best of best .
1597	476	YOU , how you 've been taken in .
1598	476	You actually worship people ?
1599	477	Yes , but point is that Obama is neither .
1600	477	Not ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_DROPOUT nor doing good ASPECT_JOB .
1601	477	So , so much for DROPOUT ASPECT_EDUCATION .
1602	478	Well , apparently Americans are not smart enough to know .
1603	478	record of ASPECT_PAST_PRESIDENTS is evidence of .
1604	478	Especially true of President .
1605	479	I know .
1606	479	job he has done makes HE look like ASPECT_HIGH-SCHOOL_DROPOUT .
1607	480	Please , please do not offend ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_DROPOUT ?
1608	482	I always tell liberals that he is coolest and down to ASPECT_EARTH_PRESIDENT we have had , PRESIDENT would be fun to hang around .
1609	482	I just do n't agree with of HE ASPECT_POLITICAL_STANCES though .
1610	483	He too arrogant and ASPECT_SELF-SERVING not to .
1611	484	What I see is ASPECT_PEOPLE who disagree with his ASPECT_POLITICAL_POSITIONS calling HIS ASPECT_IGNORANT .
1612	484	Which is ignorant in IMO , IMO .
1613	485	He 's not ignorant .
1614	485	HE knows exactly what HE is doing , but what HE is doing is wrong .
1615	485	HE does n't care what people want , HE only cares about what HE wants HE .
1616	486	selfish ASPECT_ACTOR , in your ASPECT_VIEW ?
1617	486	Conservatives should love ACTOR .
1618	487	Why should I love him ?
1619	487	I do n't think there is 1 HIM has done in office that I agree with .
1620	487	Be I guest and try to name conservative ASPECT_GUEST has done ...
1621	488	Acted in his selfish ASPECT_INTEREST .
1622	489	Ended torture of individuals in custody of ASPECT_UNITED_States ASPECT_GOVERNMENT in compliance with ASPECT_US_LAW and Constitution .
1623	489	While STATES know there are ASPECT_EXCEPTIONS_STATES would think conservatives support following ASPECT_US_LAW and Constitution but ASPECT_STATES could be wrong .
1624	490	Universally true of president in my ASPECT_LIFETIME .
1625	491	Meanwhile Afghanistan ASPECT_CONFLICT , `` war of necessity ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA acknowledged proceeds on yet ASPECT_PROTESTS in America are ASPECT_MINIMAL_and ASPECT_SUPPORT for Afghanistan ASPECT_WAR diminishes .
1626	491	Obama foreign ASPECT_POLICY -LRB- ASPECT_U.S._IMPERIALISM_-RRB- advocates ASPECT_CALAMITY by approving execution of ASPECT_SOMALIA_PIRATES , authorization of ASPECT_AIR_MISSILE strikes in ASPECT_PAKISTAN_, Afghanistan and ASPECT_YEMEN_MURDERING_innocent ASPECT_CIVILIANS .
1627	492	question being addressed was what has ASPECT_OBAMA_DONE which conservatives would support and I guess we can through in war in Afghanistan as conservative ASPECT_SUPPORT although QUESTION serves no ASPECT_CURRENT_PURPOSE_and ASPECT_LIBERTATIANS_and ASPECT_LIBERALS are fundamentally opposed to QUESTION .
1628	492	ASPECT_SOMALIA_PIRATES have not been subjected to execution to I knowledge but use of deadly ASPECT_FORCE to protect innocents has been authorized .
1629	492	is normal ASPECT_LAW_ENFORCEMENT_ISSUE .
1630	492	Predator strikes in Pakistan are probably approved by conservatives and perhaps ASPECT_LIBERALS and are being done with covert ASPECT_PAKISTAN_GOVERNMENT_APPROVAL from what I understand .
1631	492	Very stupid ASPECT_MOVE IMO because PAKISTAN is increasing ASPECT_TERRORIST_THREAT against US as we have seen with attempted Times ASPECT_SQUARE bombing .
1632	492	Americans should oppose ASPECT_EXTRA-JUDICIAL_EXECUTIONS which are by definition violation of law .
1633	493	Well , I 'm one does n't like man as person .
1634	493	MAN arrogant , conniving and ASPECT_LEADING country to destruction .
1635	493	Then again I suppose there were liked ASPECT_HITLER_and ASPECT_STALIN personally until they suffered under THEY .
1636	493	You may not see writing on wall , but of us do .
1637	493	For once , I 'd like to hear Obama speak up about ASPECT_GOOD of America , not always apologizing and denigrating country .
1638	494	You misread Obama if you think OBAMA is coolest and down to ASPECT_EARTH_PRESIDENT we have had .
1639	494	OBAMA is neither .
1640	494	OBAMA is cold and calculating and down to earth about OBAMA is ASPECT_OBAMA_DESIRE to ` down ' America .
1641	495	He has n't ended anything except peace and ASPECT_TRANQUILITY of nation .
1642	495	HE certainly has n't ended torture of individuals in custody of ASPECT_U.S._GOVERNMENT .
1643	495	Heck , I 'm tortured ASPECT_EVERYDAY as citizen of great ASPECT_COUNTRY time CITIZEN speaks , does sneaky or one of his swooning ASPECT_LIBERALS suck up to CITIZEN .
1644	495	Give I Gitmo .
1645	495	Oh , I 'm already at Gitmo .
1646	495	ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY has and continues to be compromised as ASPECT_GITMO_scars ASPECT_AMERICA forever .
1647	496	RR was exception .
1648	497	As ASPECT_PERSON_PRESIDENT is down to earth ... as president ABSOLUTELY ASPECT_NOT !
1649	497	I understand , but I think you have to distinguish between two .
1650	497	Liberals think PRESIDENT is good ASPECT_PRESIDENT just because LIBERALS think PRESIDENT is cool .
1651	498	Exhibiting ASPECT_APOCRYPHAL_VERNACULAR for sole ASPECT_PURPOSE to beguile and deceive segment of America population indicates disoriented , ASPECT_MERCURIAL_INDIVIDUAL .
1652	498	Furthermore , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA has evolved into discordant ASPECT_HELLION and nuisance to ASPECT_SOCIETAL_FABRIC of great ASPECT_NATION .
1653	500	Not ASPECT_MR_REAGEN , but very true about Bonnie & ASPECT_CLYDE_CLINTON , & ASPECT_FATAH_OBAMA !!!
1654	501	I still disagree that he is cool .
1655	501	Suppose you have n't seen HE riled up yet .
1656	501	I have and so has HE staff .
1657	501	Wait until books come out from HE ASPECT_UNDERLINGS .
1658	501	You 'll freak out , you 'll definitely find out HE is not cool , just ASPECT_COLD .
1659	501	HE tries to maintain image , but true ASPECT_HE is coming out as HE ca n't handle criticism , HE achilles ' ASPECT_HEEL .
1660	501	jthorp24 , throw water on your ASPECT_FACE , awake from daze .
1661	502	Like so ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES have over ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH ?
1662	502	ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH loves Satanic ASPECT_ROCKER , ASPECT_OZZY_OSBOURNE , so very ASPECT_BUSH invited Ozzy to ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE_BALL on Saturday , ASPECT_MAY_4 , ASPECT_2002 , where BUSH complimented BUSH and showed BUSH best ASPECT_HOSPITALITY President of ASPECT_UNITED_STATES could lavish .
1663	502	What is supposedly Born ASPECT_AGAIN Christian ASPECT_PRESIDENT_DOING showering complimentary ASPECT_HONORS on Satanic ASPECT_ROCKER ?
1664	502	Why is Bush stating BUSH ASPECT_LOVE for Ozzy sickening ASPECT_SONGS , of which BUSH ASPECT_NAMES ?
1665	502	Thus , invitation demonstrates special ASPECT_REGARD in which ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH holds ASPECT_OZZY_OSBOURNE .
1666	502	But , then , why should we be surprised , for Bush told WE in quote , above , `` ASPECT_OZZY_, ASPECT_MOM loves your ASPECT_STUFF .
1667	502	ASPECT_MOTHER_and ASPECT_SON_love ASPECT_OZZY_OSBOURNE .
1668	502	What does Bible say ?
1669	502	`` Have no ASPECT_FELLOWSHIP with unfruitful ASPECT_WORKS of darkness , but rather reprove WE .
1670	502	ASPECT_EPH_5:11 -LRB- ASPECT_KJV_-RRB- http:\/\/www.cuttingedge.org\/news\/n1758.cfm
1671	503	Actually Ozzy is now christian , but good ASPECT_JOB being wrong .
1672	503	ASPECT_TYPICAL_LIBERAL .
1673	503	Obama went to racist ASPECT_CHURCH for years , so nice ASPECT_TRY .
1674	504	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY has given him no ASPECT_CHOICE but to act in partisan ASPECT_MANNER .
1675	505	way Obama acts has to do with us ASPECT_REPUBLICANS .
1676	505	Do n't make excuses for Obama .
1677	507	I never said Bush was cool or did I support BUSH in BUSH ASPECT_LIBERAL to moderate tendencies when BUSH strayed from conservative ASPECT_PRINCIPLES or Christian ASPECT_VALUES .
1678	507	I take no ASPECT_ISSUE with scripture you mentioned .
1680	508	No ASPECT_CHOICE ?
1681	508	President is president of Americans not just Democrats .
1682	508	PRESIDENT suppose to be representing of us , PRESIDENT has choice .
1683	508	CHOICE is PRESIDENT that steers ship , not Republicans .
1684	508	Now if PRESIDENT would choose to stand for America and Americans rather than choose to stand on America and be internationalist ASPECT_PRESIDENT is and stop berating history and ignoring Constitution .
1685	508	Standing with Calderon at expense of ASPECT_AMERICAN_STATE .
1686	508	Ditto Democrats in Congress who gave ASPECT_CALDERON_standing ASPECT_OVATION .
1687	508	Now seeing major ASPECT_CITIES boycott Arizona .
1688	508	NOW comical since cities themselves have major ASPECT_ISSUES with illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRATION and busted ASPECT_ECONOMY .
1689	509	I did n't know Obama was on ballot yet .
1690	509	Ditto for Palin .
1691	509	Palin may have killed moose , but Obama is killing golden ASPECT_GOOSE .
1692	511	Why should people believe you when PEOPLE can just go to Politifact and check ASPECT_POLITIFACT_SCORE ?
1693	511	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/POLITIFACT.COM\/TRUTH-O-METER\/PROMISES\/THE_PRESIDENT has kept 113 ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_PROMISES , which over 200 ASPECT_IN-THE-WORKS , at stage of completion .
1694	511	To be fair ASPECT_PRESIDENT has broken handful and compromised on .
1695	511	But to say PRESIDENT has not kept ASPECT_PRESIDENT_CAMPAIGN promises outright would be ASPECT_UNFAIR_and ASPECT_BIAS to say .
1696	511	I voted yes and I would vote for YES , especially since Republican ASPECT_WONT_OFFER who would make better ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
1697	511	When Libertarian run as Republican , do n't win primary .
1698	511	RUN will be another ASPECT_GOP_CRONY in 2012 .
1699	512	ASPECT_YOUR_golden ASPECT_GOOSE , huh ?
1700	512	Or , as it is more commonly known days , lame ASPECT_DUCK .
1701	512	Thanks to magpies on ASPECT_WALL_ST.
1702	515	Sure there are MARXIST kept , but major ASPECT_ONES , MARXIST did n't , like transparency , eliminating earmarks and going line by line to cut waste , ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for 95 of Americans , not being business as usual in Washington , etc. And then MARXIST is well on ASPECT_MARXIST_WAY with major destructive ASPECT_LEGISLATION such as ASPECT_HCR_, Cap & ASPECT_TRADE , Amnesty for illegals , bailouts , failed stimulus , increasing spending beyond ASPECT_EARTH_ORBIT , ASPECT_RECORD_DEFICIT .
1703	515	MARXIST 's ASPECT_MARXIST_, socialist , ASPECT_WHATEVER , is more interested in ASPECT_MARXIST_LEGACY , power , big ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_BUREAUCRACY , etc. than ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE .
1704	516	ASPECT_VERSUS_conservative ASPECT_FRIENDS , who are more interested in not sharing ASPECT_FRIENDS_WEALTH that what is good for ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE .
1705	517	Stop trying to justify free-loading .
1706	518	Sharing wealth is socialist ASPECT_PRINCIPLE Americans would oppose .
1707	518	want handouts , and refuse to work for living .
1708	518	Why should one group support ASPECT_ANOTHER ?
1709	518	Why should ASPECT_ONE_HARD-EARNED_MONEY be taken from ONE and given to who is lazy ?
1710	519	Sure , when you stop trying to justify laissez-faire .
1711	520	Good ASPECT_POINT .
1712	520	We 've seen masses out there demanding termination of ASPECT_SS_and ASPECT_MEDICARE .
1713	520	What was senior ASPECT_TEA_PARTIERS were saying ?
1714	520	`` Keep govt out of ASPECT_WE_MEDICARE !
1715	520	LOLFor record , I do n't support providing ASPECT_TERM_BENEFITS to able who are able to get ASPECT_JOB_and ASPECT_WORK and wo n't .
1716	520	Nor is that design of ASPECT_WE_unemployment ASPECT_SYSTEM .
1717	521	Certainly nonsensical ASPECT_ALLEGATION is in mandated apolitical ASPECT_POSITION and should be discarded promptly .
1718	521	ASPECT_CURRENT_VICE_PRESIDENT_JOE -LRB- Where ASPECT_WALDO_-RRB- ASPECT_BIDEN_and ASPECT_JOE_WIFE gave dismal ASPECT_AVERAGE of 369 per year to charities during ASPECT_PAST_DECADE .
1719	521	In 1988 , Democrat ASPECT_AL_GORE was humiliated when ASPECT_GORE_TAX_RETURNS affirmed that GORE gave lugubrious ASPECT_353 to charity .
1720	521	In 1993 , Democrat ASPECT_JOHN_KERRY gave 175 to deprived , impoverished .
1721	521	In 1995 , avaricious Democrat ASPECT_JOHN_KERRY gave whopping zero , ASPECT_ZILCH_, ASPECT_NADA_, to charity .
1722	521	In 1970 , Ted ASPECT_KENNEDY ASPECT_NET_WORTH of nearly 8 ASPECT_MILLION and annual ASPECT_INCOME of approximately ASPECT_461,400 and gave miserable 1 ASPECT_PERCENT of ASPECT_KENNEDY_INCOME to charity .
1723	522	Just like not ASPECT_SINGLE_PERSON who receives ASPECT_GOVT_BENEFITS is lazy , right ?
1724	524	True , but they still like him .
1726	524	I do n't know .
1727	526	Good for you for being into politics at ASPECT_YOUNG_AGE !
1728	527	Being 19 ASPECT_MYSELF ... lot of ASPECT_MYSELF_FRIENDS think MYSELF 'm weird ASPECT_CAUSE_MYSELF get into politics lol
1730	528	If AGREED runs against like ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN then choice is obvious , but if ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY changes things up and picks viable ASPECT_CANDIDATE with IQ above 100 then I would have to weigh ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_POLICIES of contender .
1731	529	If she runs against like ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA then choice is obvious , but if ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY_CHANGES things up and picks viable ASPECT_CANDIDATE with IQ above 100 then I would have to weigh ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_POLICIES of contender .
1732	530	might be slightly more adorable if were n't comparing ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_GRADUATE with who got B.S. in communication from University of Idaho .
1733	531	haha , 's what i was thinking
1734	532	No ASPECT_ONE with IQ below 100 could have graduated ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_MAGNA_CUM_LAUDE .
1735	533	Using your ASPECT_RATIONALE , anything is possible .
1736	534	I do n't get it .
1737	535	Just because people wear crosses does n't make ASPECT_PEOPLE_CHRISTIAN .
1738	535	You need to read up on Ozzie , you ca n't worship Satan and be Christian .
1739	535	If you believe that Ozzie is Christian , you have no ASPECT_IDEA what Christian is .
1740	535	It is apparent -LRB- Bush and ASPECT_QUAYLE -RRB- due to ASPECT_PEOPLE_AFFIRMATION of Osbourne call good evil and evil ASPECT_GOOD .
1741	535	ASPECT_OZZFEST_2005 ???
1742	535	What ASPECT_KIND of `` Christians would perform at known Satanic ASPECT_FESTIVAL ?
1743	535	ASPECT_OZZY_OSBORNE is as Satanic as can be , but ironically denies being Satanist .
1744	535	Whether SATANIST 're ASPECT_SATANIST_or not ASPECT_OZZY , YOURSELF are 100 ASPECT_SATANIC !!!
1745	535	Since ASPECT_YEAR_2000 , of Ozzy albums have featured Pagan ASPECT_GOD , Pan , on ASPECT_FRONT_COVER .

1747	535	One of hottest ASPECT_CELEBRITIES_TODAY is vulgar , violent and demonic ASPECT_OZZY_OSBOURNE .
1748	535	MTV recently launched profanity-soaked ASPECT_OSBOURNES_FAMILY_SHOW .
1749	535	Osbournes is simply filmed during ASPECT_OZ_and ASPECT_FAMILY s normal -LRB- if you could possibly call OZ -RRB- daily ASPECT_LIFE .
1750	535	No ASPECT_ACTING .
1751	535	No ASPECT_PRETENSE .
1752	535	Just simply being ASPECT_S_abnormal ASPECT_SELF .
1753	535	SIMPLY s just `` ASPECT_FAMILY_TIME with Osbournes .
1754	535	CHRISTIANS stomached one nauseating ASPECT_VIEWING of Osbournes -LRB- and believe CHRISTIANS was one too many ! -RRB-
1756	535	CHRISTIANS counted 51 ASPECT_OCCURRENCES of `` ASPECT_F-WORD in little over 15 ASPECT_MINUTES -LRB- episode `` Dinner with Ozzy -RRB- .
1757	535	Profanity and ASPECT_PERVERSION is spewed by ASPECT_OZ_KIN_OZ , wife , ASPECT_TEENAGE_daughter and ASPECT_SON .
1758	535	Of course , MTV `` bleeps worse ASPECT_PROFANITY out , but words are easily understood .
1759	535	In between onslaught of f-words , and depravity , ASPECT_DRUG-COOKED-BURNT-OUT_OZZY_STAGGERS , mumbles , shakes and screams in state of spaced-out , confusion .

1764	535	ASPECT_FORMER_VICE-PRESIDENT , who went ballistic because TV s ASPECT_MURPHY_BROWN had baby out of wedlock .
1765	535	When asked ASPECT_VICE-PRESIDENT_OPINION of Osbournes , Quayle replied Osbournes were `` good ASPECT_ENTERTAINMENT and `` good ASPECT_FAMILY_VALUES .
1766	535	Dan did you somehow miss episode where Oz puts condoms in ASPECT_QUAYLE_TEENAGERS_DRAWERS so S can have `` safe ASPECT_SEX ?

1769	535	Plus ASPECT_QUAD-TRILLION_VULGARITIES and perverse ASPECT_CONVERSATIONS .
1770	535	Good ASPECT_ENTERTAINMENT .
1771	535	Good ASPECT_FAMILY_VALUES .
1772	535	God help us .
1774	535	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.AV1611.ORG\/ROCK\/OZZY.HTML_OBAMA is Christian and at least ASPECT_GOES to church .
1775	535	Your so-called Christian ASPECT_BUSH does n't even go to church .
1776	535	Oh , CHRISTIANS forgot , going to church does n't make you Christian , wearing cross does .
1777	535	And FYI , fact that ASPECT_REV_WRIGHT called out sins of country does not make ASPECT_WRIGHT_RACIST .
1778	535	is conservative lie , because they just want to make Obama appear bad .
1779	536	Maybe not so much because you are 19 , but because you do n't know what you are talking about ?
1780	537	People with IQ below 100 do n't know !
1781	539	You all and your ASPECT_FASCINATION with Harvard .
1782	539	Remember Bush was graduate there but does BUSH get your adoring ASPECT_SUPPORT ?
1783	539	Does Obama come across as intellectual ?
1784	539	I think not !!!
1785	540	Sure they have .
1786	540	Ever hear of dumbing down ASPECT_CURRICULUM_and ASPECT_GRADE_INFLATION ?
1787	540	Part of affirmative ASPECT_ACTION and ASPECT_POLITICAL_CORRECTNESS .
1788	540	Besides MCL does n't mean one has commonsense or is wise .
1789	540	Obama is living ASPECT_PROOF of .
1790	541	I have n't heard that ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_SCHOOL has dumbed down curriculum as part of affirmative ASPECT_ACTION .
1791	541	proof of or are THIS just demonstrating your racists ASPECT_BELIEFS ?
1792	541	evidence of dumbing down I 've seen are posts I read here .
1793	543	Actually you do n't .
1794	543	You pull up articles from years ago and read them like THEM are current .
1795	543	I 've watched MAN go on talk shows ASPECT_PAST_MONTHS and MAN is ASPECT_CHANGED_MAN .
1796	543	MAN been ASPECT_SOBER for years now .
1797	543	MAN is also pretty big ASPECT_CHRISTIAN now and MAN feels really bad for ASPECT_WAY_MAN acted years ago .
1798	543	MAN lived pretty crazy ASPECT_LIFE .
1799	543	of things MAN did were for show .
1800	543	I would n't expect you to know that though .
1801	543	Which just made I think ... Obama going to christian ASPECT_CHURCH is for show as well .
1802	543	Why would muslim go to christian ASPECT_CHURCH ?
1803	543	Cause OBAMA is president and wants to look good .
1804	543	I do n't care if Bush went to church or not .
1805	543	You do n't have to attend church to be christian .
1806	543	I love how time brings up bad about Obama , liberals compare OBAMA to Bush .
1807	543	If OBAMA is best ASPECT_PRESIDENT ever like you think why in world would you compare OBAMA to worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT in history of US -LRB- ASPECT_GEORGE_Bush ASPECT_-RRB- ?
1808	543	It seems like you would set your ASPECT_STANDARDS higher .
1809	543	WORLD 's like best ASPECT_TEAM in ASPECT_NFL_COMPARING LIBERALS to worst ASPECT_TEAM in NFL .
1810	544	LOL here is to hoping VOTER wo n't be ASPECT_OBAMA_VOTER .
1811	545	Which ASPECT_BUSH ?
1813	546	I was going to answer , `` over I dead ASPECT_BODY .
1814	546	I answer is `` Hail ASPECT_NO .
1815	546	I have tried to give man benefit of doubt in I own ASPECT_MIND_SEVERAL_TIMES , just to be embarrased for MAN .
1816	546	MAN fake ASPECT_FAKE until you make FAKE ASPECT_TYPE of man .
1817	546	ASPECT_MAN_CHARISMA is not charming anymore and ASPECT_MAN_EGO is over-inflated .
1818	546	second ASPECT_TERM President .
1819	546	Lord , I hope not .
1820	546	good , one ASPECT_TERM President ?
1821	546	Keep wishing ASPECT_OBAMA .
1822	547	He 's run out of excuses .
1823	547	HE has n't had ASPECT_PRESS_CONFERENCE in 9 ASPECT_MONTHS .
1824	547	HE 's afraid to answer questions .
1825	547	Just look at ASPECT_PRESS_BRIEFING with ASPECT_PRESIDENT_CALDERON .
1826	547	CALDERON even signed freedom of ASPECT_PRESS_ACT , and finished off with `` no ASPECT_QUESTIONS will be taken .
1827	547	Daily ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_TRACKING_POLL : http:\/\/www.rasmussenreports.com\/publ..._tracking_poll
1828	548	Oh please .
1829	548	When he was having ASPECT_FREQUENT_PRESS_CONFERENCES_CONSERVATIVES complained that HE was still in ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_MODE and not doing HE job .
1830	548	Now HE is working instead of having ASPECT_PRESS_CONFERENCES and you say HE 's too scared to answer questions .
1831	549	Here 's today ASPECT_RASMUSSEN_REPORT : Daily ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_TRACKING_POLLTUESDAY , ASPECT_MAY_25 , ASPECT_2010 ASPECT_RASMUSSEN_Reports daily ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_TRACKING_POLL for Tuesday shows 24 of nation voters Strongly Approve of way that ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA is performing OBAMA ASPECT_ROLE as president .
1832	549	Forty-four ASPECT_PERCENT -LRB- 44 -RRB- Strongly Disapprove , giving Obama ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_Approval ASPECT_INDEX_RATING of -20 -LRB- see trends -RRB- .
1833	549	ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_Approval ASPECT_INDEX is calculated by subtracting who Strongly Disapprove from who Strongly Approve .
1834	549	INDEX is updated daily at 9:30 a.m. ASPECT_EASTERN -LRB- sign up for free daily ASPECT_E-MAIL_UPDATE_-RRB- .
1835	549	Updates are also available on ASPECT_TWITTER_and ASPECT_FACEBOOK .
1836	549	Overall , 42 of voters say VOTERS at least somewhat approve of president performance .
1837	549	is lowest ASPECT_LEVEL of approval yet measured for president .
1838	549	Fifty-six ASPECT_PERCENT -LRB- 56 -RRB- now disapprove of ASPECT_PRESIDENT_PERFORMANCEI am one who disapproves .
1839	551	Well , with said .
1840	551	know who you are going to vote for .
1841	551	Fair minded , you are not .
1842	552	No , no ASPECT_ONE was complaining of NO having ASPECT_FREQUENT_PRESS_CONFERENCES .
1843	552	They were complaining of NO almost daily ASPECT_NEWS_MEDIA_BLITZ -LRB- tour -RRB- on practically ASPECT_SUBJECT known to man , even detailed ASPECT_INFORMATION on matters not necessarily of importance to President of U.S. .
1844	552	What we have discovered is man is not great ASPECT_ORATOR many thought NO was .
1845	552	Well , perhaps when MAN uses teleprompter but even then MAN quoted what was in cases screw up of ASPECT_TELEPROMPTER_or ASPECT_DATA MAN viewed .
1846	552	MAN does not do well when questioned and MAN has to ASPECT_WING_TELEPROMPTER .
1847	552	Typical of Presidents but difference is ASPECT_MAN_LACK of knowledge and ASPECT_EXPERIENCE which is understandable when you consider ASPECT_MAN_BACKGROUND .
1848	552	I was bit of stutterer when I was in ASPECT_1ST_GRADE , but I did n't stutter because I did n't know ASPECT_SUBJECT_MATERIAL .
1849	552	STUTTERER is not scared , STUTTERER just unprepared and does not relish to be fool , but STUTTERER fails .
1850	553	Do you find Obama ideologically acceptable ?
1851	554	It is really comical to hear people , who think ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN is better than ASPECT_SLICED_BREAD , with her ASPECT_JOURNALIST_SCHOLARSHIP from 5 different ASPECT_COLLEGES criticize Obama when ASPECT_PALIN_well ASPECT_KNOWN to be eloquent .
1852	554	Sounds to me like sour ASPECT_GRAPES .
1853	554	We should have Bush back , with BUSH ASPECT_INABILITY to complete ASPECT_SENTENCE_and ASPECT_MISPRONOUNCE word .
1854	554	Obama does quite well .
1855	554	OBAMA does lot better than ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN will ever do , with MISPRONOUNCE ASPECT_PTA_PRESIDENT_BACKGROUND , and WE wo n't mention Bush , everyone knows how well BUSH used to do , bwahaha !
1856	554	LOT has been made quite obvious that conservatives will never warm up to OBAMA , but is inconsequential .
1857	554	What CONSERVATIVES gave country 8 ASPECT_YEARS is WE wo n't get over for time , but BS about ASPECT_OBAMA_NOT being able to speak well , being unprepared ASPECT_AND cons are throwing out , is just that BS .
1858	555	I think ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH is more intelligent than ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , yes .
1859	556	I thought you did n't think too of Bush ?
1861	556	ASPECT_OZZIE_OSBOURNE ?
1862	557	I think highly of Bush , still do .
1863	557	I like Americans would long to have had ASPECT_THIRD_TERM for Bush rather than what we have now tries to pass as President .
1864	557	President of what ASPECT_COUNTRY ?
1865	557	Certainly not U.S.
1866	558	I agree .
1867	558	Obama makes mockery of country and Presidency .
1868	558	OBAMA is anti-American ASPECT_POLITICIAN in Washington .
1869	558	OBAMA bashed country on ASPECT_OBAMA_World Apology ASPECT_TOUR , and now ASPECT_OBAMA_SIDES with foreign ASPECT_LEADERS against U.S. What 's next , Dictator ASPECT_SUMMIT ?
1870	558	OBAMA 's going to invite Ahmadinejad , Chavez , and Il to ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE to find ASPECT_WAYS_AHMADINEJAD could improve AHMADINEJAD .
1871	559	It amazes me that there are still think Obama has ASPECT_SILVER_TONGUE and is wonderful ASPECT_SPEAKER .
1872	559	ASPECT_OBAMA_STUTTERS more than ASPECT_PORKY_PIG and does n't have prayer when PIG comes to winging PIG .
1873	559	Even ASPECT_BUSH puts unman to shame .
1874	559	Bush may have not been greatest ASPECT_ORATOR , but BUSH was man who obviously loved and cared about America and AMERICA ASPECT_PEOPLE , showed strength in face of enemies and did n't remind ASPECT_PEOPLE_EVERYDAY AMERICA about BUSH -LRB- as Obama does -RRB- .
1875	559	Obama does quite well doing what ???
1876	559	One and half-years in ASPECT_OFFICE_and ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_OBAMA_HENCHMEN\/WOMEN have totally run country into ground with no ASPECT_UPSWING in sight .
1877	559	If Bush or ASPECT_MCCAIN were in office would have already seen recovery , ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA would n't be issue ASPECT_KOREA is today and Israel would know ISRAEL would n't have to go ISRAEL alone .
1878	559	You keep supporting ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_OBAMA failed policies and know will welcome you back when insanity is over .
1879	560	Please get back to me when your ASPECT_CHIMPANZEE learns how to pronounce ASPECT_CORPSMAN_, ASPECT_ORION_and ASPECT_POCK-IS-STAN for starters .
1880	560	CORPSMAN 's not doing so hot , perhaps ORION 's because CORPSMAN spent much of ASPECT_CORPSMAN_formative ASPECT_YEARS growing up in ASPECT_3RD_WORLD .
1881	560	Can one `` catch ASPECT_SICKLE_CELL ?
1882	561	At least Bush said it way IT was .
1883	561	BUSH did n't try to use words to BS BUSH ASPECT_WAY around .
1884	561	Obama ability to speak well , with TelePrompTer and speech written by ASPECT_TWENTY-SOMETHING_YEAR_OLD , just enables OBAMA to deliver BS to sheeple so that they buy into what OBAMA is saying .
1885	561	Speaking well does not imply knowledge and ASPECT_COMPETENCE .
1886	562	Can we just not play mispronunciation ASPECT_GAME ?
1887	562	GAME really stupid ASPECT_GAME .
1888	562	who does lot of speaking is going to mess up words .
1889	562	Besides I 'm pretty sure ASPECT_BUSH has ASPECT_OBAMA_BEAT in area .
1890	562	So PATH 's not exactly wisest ASPECT_PATH to take for conservative .
1891	562	Focus on policies .
1892	562	Of which ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN has good ASPECT_ONES .
1893	563	Reading with one ASPECT_EYE or does n't EYE matter to you that I was responding to Bozo playing game ?
1894	563	Try reading slower ASPECT_TIME , you might keep up .
1895	564	I was addressing everyone .
1896	564	Boy you sure seem to enjoy letting world know you 're arrogant .
1897	566	YOU suppose you thought Bush pronunciation of `` ASPECT_NUKELAR was right up there with Palin lack of ASPECT_READING_ABILITIES !
1899	566	Thanks for proving once again how racist and bigoted ASPECT_REPUBLICAN\/CONSERVATIVES are .
1900	566	YOU guess you are not part of `` Compassionate Conservative ASPECT_GROUP - oh wait , calling oneself compassionate does n't mean you have to be !
1902	567	When he could n't remember second ASPECT_SENTENCE of adage ?
1903	567	`` Fool ASPECT_HE_once ASPECT_ER , er , `` well , HE ca n't fool ER twice !
1905	567	BWAHAHA would have if BWAHAHA had known words .
1906	567	At least Obama does n't have to rely on `` ASPECT_PHONICS_TELEPROMPTER .
1907	567	And , Obama did n't have to go to `` debate camp to learn what foreign ASPECT_POLICY meant .
1908	567	For ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_TELEPROMPTER does n't .
1909	567	CONSERVATIVES are satisfied with ASPECT_HOCKEY_MOM , who does n't read newspapers , did n't know MOM ASPECT_PRESIDENT doctrine , and writes notes on MOM ASPECT_HANDS so MOM can remember what topic is !
1910	567	is why CONSERVATIVES resent Obama , CONSERVATIVES do n't understand what ASPECT_OBAMA is saying - goes over ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_HEADS .
1911	568	I would n't have used nice ASPECT_WORD .
1912	569	Just to be clear , you are fine with Bush inviting ASPECT_OZZIE_OSBOURNE to ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE_DINNER , praising OSBOURNE -LRB- Satanic -RRB- ASPECT_MUSIC and even admitting ASPECT_OSBOURNE_MOM , ASPECT_BARBARA_BUSH loves MUSIC too ?
1913	569	Interesting , for that refers to Christianity so often in his\/her ASPECT_POSTS .
1914	569	guess there lot of delusional ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES who still think `` ASPECT_AMERICANS were fond of Bush as we kicked BUSH out of office and with low ASPECT_RATING to boot !
1915	569	do n't doubt RECESSION , because it appears that conservatives do n't care what ASPECT_STATE CONSERVATIVES put country in , whether RECESSION is depression , recession , or toilet , as long as CONSERVATIVES have ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_PARTY of `` no at helm .
1916	569	And , CONSERVATIVES continue to support ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_LEADERS , when CONSERVATIVES see that CONSERVATIVES are going against everything is helpful to Americans .
1917	569	Thank God for Obama .
1918	569	still believe what Romans ASPECT_13 says .
1919	570	Bush would n't deliver BS like ... -LRB- -RRB- budget pays down ASPECT_RECORD_AMOUNT of ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT .
1920	570	We will pay off 2 ASPECT_TRILLION of debt over decade .
1921	570	ASPECT_FUTURE_GENERATIONS should n't be forced to pay back ASPECT_MONEY that WE have borrowed .
1922	570	WE owe kind of responsibility to ASPECT_WE_children and ASPECT_GRANDCHILDREN .
1923	570	would he ?
1924	573	No , I 'm correct , Chimp is arrogant , there IS difference .
1925	574	You did n't see me defending Bush grammar did you ?
1927	574	Nope , ME think not .
1928	574	ME guess you were up in arms when idiots made movie about Bush assassination ?
1929	574	Maybe but ASPECT_ME_KINDA -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_ING_DOUBT MOVIE .
1930	577	You are fixated on OO , kind of like you are with BO .
1931	577	As is BO fondness for satanic ASPECT_RELIGION of Islam .
1932	577	Americans did not ` kick ' Bush out of office .
1933	577	BUSH successfully completed BUSH two ASPECT_TERMS as President .
1934	577	than ASPECT_BO will be able to say .
1935	577	If you look back at year of Bush ASPECT_2ND_TERM , you 'll note that ASPECT_DOWNWARD_SPIRAL in financial and ASPECT_JOB_SITUATION started in ASPECT_SEPTEMBER_2008 , one ASPECT_MONTH after BO was nominated over Hillary .
1936	577	It was BUSH ASPECT_NOMINATION started run on ASPECT_WALL_STREET and ASPECT_MAIN_STREET as everyone with sense moved money to safer ASPECT_ENVIRONS because of concern for ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY_and BUSH radical ASPECT_IDEAS .
1937	577	We are now reaping fruit -LRB- or ASPECT_LIKELY_WEEDS -RRB- of BUSH ASPECT_UNLEADERSHIP_and ASPECT_DENUNCIATION of America .
1938	577	Oh , yes .
1939	577	As part of God Plan , BO is instrumental ASPECT_FIGURE , but not way you might think .
1940	577	PART preparing ASPECT_WE for anti-christ .
1941	578	Perhaps on planet Bizarro .
1942	579	He only seems arrogant to who do n't understand what HE says , not really HE fault , but difference here is Obama has brain .
1943	580	Bush could never compare to Obama in eloquence .
1944	580	Poor ASPECT_BUSH , had to have BUSH ASPECT_PHONICS_TELEPROMPTER , and still BUSH could n't pronounce words right .
1945	580	criticism from right just shows what sore losers ASPECT_LOSERS are .
1946	580	Now is understatement .
1947	580	Sure ASPECT_BUSH did , is why BUSH did n't mind disregarding Constitution and telling us BUSH was `` decider ?
1948	580	was n't strength - CONSTITUTION was ignorance .
1949	580	Have n't you heard phrase `` Ignorance is bliss .
1950	580	Putting interests of people ahead of interests of corporations , unlike Bush\/Cheney .
1951	580	Er , excuse ASPECT_ME , country was already run into ground by time Obama took over , and for we can thank Bush , one that conservatives still give OBAMA pass on .
1952	580	If Bush or ASPECT_MCCAIN were in ASPECT_OFFICE_WE would n't be posting on forum , country would be so deep into depression you would have had to sell your ASPECT_COMPUTER to buy bread .
1953	580	How can policies drove country into toilet take COUNTRY out ?
1954	580	Only warped conservative ASPECT_THINKING can come up with ASPECT_CRAP like .
1955	580	No , Bush would have WE in war with Korea , making ASPECT_WE_SOLDIERS deploy there after serving in ASPECT_IRAQ_and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN without break .
1956	580	Israel is well equipped to take care of ISRAEL .
1957	580	Why do conservatives feel like WE have to babysit Israel ?
1958	580	Welcome ASPECT_ME back ?
1959	580	ME 'm not going anywhere .
1960	580	And was n't Obama policies that failed , were Bush .
1961	580	Conservative have short ASPECT_MEMORIES , ASPECT_ME_GUESS are now going to say that Bush actually increased Surplus and was n't responsible for loss of thousands of soldiers , not to mention ASPECT_IRAQI_CITIZENS .
1962	581	Gosh , OBAMA are ASPECT_OBAMA_`` model ASPECT_CITIZEN .
1963	581	Anybody does n't agree with Obama is stupid .
1964	581	CITIZEN mean because no ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE has brain .
1965	581	At point he needs to stop mocking people and actually answer questions .
1966	581	How has POINT been since HE 's done ASPECT_PRESS_CONFERENCE ?
1967	584	country lived through FDR and re-elected FDR three ASPECT_TIMES .
1968	584	I seriously doubt that ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_PRESIDENT could create harm to ASPECT_UNITED_STATES than FDR .
1969	585	FDR came in with worst ASPECT_DEPRESSION in history , turned economy around and won world ASPECT_WAR .
1970	585	Bush came in with surplus ASPECT_BUDGET , left worst ASPECT_RECESSION since then and got us in mistaken ASPECT_WAR .
1971	585	Not even close .
1972	586	I understand rabid ASPECT_PARTISANSHIP .
1973	587	swipe at President with disability ?
1974	587	Though I think FDR ASPECT_SOCIAL_IMPLEMENTATIONS were misappropriation of funds and failed ASPECT_REASONING , I happen to admire man who stood up to ASPECT_JAPAN_and ASPECT_GERMANY attempts to conquer world .
1975	587	Obama ai n't no ASPECT_FDR !!!
1976	587	radical ASPECT_ISLAMIC_ENEMIES will not be stood up against by weak-kneed , ASPECT_WIMP_PRESIDENT of today .
1977	587	Even ASPECT_JIMMY_CARTER would be improvement .
1978	588	By way , I enjoyed your ASPECT_POST of 9-15-2009 .
1979	589	Maybe he should invade ASPECT_MOROCCO_OR to make you feel better .
1980	589	After we pay for 1 trillion ASPECT_DEBT from ASPECT_IRAQ_MISTAKE .
1981	590	liberals want end to wars too if you check out ASPECT_NEWS_and ASPECT_COMMENTARIES .
1982	590	i think he 's just there for bipartisanship ?
1983	590	maybe if HE announces pull out before HE cycle is over HE will get re elected .
1984	590	would be good ASPECT_POLITICS , lets say republicans get majority then HE announces and end to wars and they say no. .
1985	590	incumbent who does n't follow suit will lose out on ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS for ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_NOMINATION and will be victory for us .
1986	591	How about trillions in debt that Obama has racked up since coming into office ?
1987	592	While about 70 ASPECT_HOUSE_DEMOCRATS opposed surge in Afghanistan overwhelmingly both Democrats and ASPECT_REPUBLICANS supported 70 .
1988	592	We can also note that during 2008 ASPECT_PRIMARIES that of ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATES except for ASPECT_KUCINICH_and ASPECT_PAUL supported continued ASPECT_US_WARS in ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST to greater or lessor ASPECT_DEGREE .
1989	593	I bet you do ... LOL
1990	594	It does n't count if Obama spends IT .
1991	594	Remember OBAMA has ASPECT_OBAMA_CURRENCY called `` ASPECT_OBAMA_MONEY .
1992	595	Measuring in trillions of dollars is somewhat hard to determine for ASPECT_SEVERAL_REASONS .
1993	595	First and foremost is that while president does have influence budget is actually established by Congress and not president .
1994	595	is fact that 2009 ASPECT_BUDGET is Bush ASPECT_BUDGET and not ASPECT_OBAMA_BUDGET although Obama did add spending to SPENDING .
1995	595	By comparison though in 8 ASPECT_YEARS ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH doubled ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT and even with projected average ASPECT_DEFICITS of almost trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS per ASPECT_YEAR_PRESIDENT_OBAMA will not double ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT that 8 inherited from Bush adminstration even if 8 remains in office for 8 ASPECT_YEARS .
1996	596	You seem to be confusing what YOU want , with what independents want .
1997	596	What independents actually like and do n't like is simple .
1998	596	There are politically sophisticated ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS , but independents are not .
1999	596	do n't know much about politics , and do n't really care to .
2000	596	So for ASPECT_PART_INDEPENDENTS dislike taxes on INDEPENDENTS .
2001	596	Whether INDEPENDENTS are ok with taxes on people is more mixed , but taxes on INDEPENDENTS are always opposed .
2002	596	INDEPENDENTS are in favor of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_PROGRAMS that INDEPENDENTS can clearly tell benefit ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS .
2003	596	So INDEPENDENTS tend to like ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , medicaid , etc. .
2004	596	INDEPENDENTS tend to dislike programs clearly directly benefit people , but not PEOPLE .
2005	596	do n't care about ASPECT_DRUG_WAR , but ones who do are probably relatively evenly split , with people opposed to ASPECT_DRUG_WAR probably slight ASPECT_MAJORITY .
2006	596	ONES might care little about ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT and balanced ASPECT_BUDGET , but LITTLE is certainly not at forefront of ASPECT_ONES_MIND .
2007	596	ONES definitely DO N'T want to end war on terror , and ONES may want rational ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_POLICY , but not people who feel -LRB- however justified or unjustified that feeling is -RRB- that immigrants are threat to ASPECT_IMMIGRANTS_JOBS .
2008	596	I agree with almost ASPECT_ASPECT of what you said , to make DO clear that I am not simply disagreeing with you for partisan ASPECT_REASONS , but independents DO NOT .
2009	596	INDEPENDENTS may agree with of points , but INDEPENDENTS are certainly not in complete ASPECT_AGREEMENT on of points .
2010	598	Or maybe they interpreted it as , `` will you vote for Obama if YOU have to vote for one of 2 ASPECT_MAIN_PARTIES , and ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN was ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE .
2011	598	Then YOU would vote yes .
2012	598	As IT stands , YOU will be voting ASPECT_3RD_PARTY in 2012 ASPECT_ELECTION , or not voting at .
2013	599	I 'd be very interested to see polls showing that independents want to cut military , SS , medicare and ASPECT_MEDICAID_SPENDING by significant ASPECT_AMOUNT .
2014	600	I would vote against Obama if Bonzo Chimp were running .
2015	600	I might possibly abstain if CHOICE were choice between Obama and ASPECT_CHARLIE_MANSON , but otherwise who stands even ASPECT_REMOTE_CHANCE of beating loser and getting LOSER and LOSER ASPECT_THUGS out of WH will get I vote ...
2016	601	independents that I have heard from want balanced ASPECT_BUDGET without ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES and would mandate cuts in both ASPECT_MILITARY_and ASPECT_ENTITLEMENT_BUDGETS because there is no ASPECT_WAY to achieve balanced ASPECT_BUDGET .
2017	601	People are delusional if PEOPLE believe that cutting 15-20 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_PORK_barrel ASPECT_SPENDING will eliminate trillion ASPECT_DOLLAR_annual ASPECT_DEFICIT and I do n't believe that independents are that delusional .
2018	601	PEOPLE know what needs to be cut even though PEOPLE are probably calling for cuts in programs ASPECT_PEOPLE_SUPPORT in principle .
2019	602	Thanks , but I 'll pass on giving ASPECT_CREDENCE to your ASPECT_ANECDOTAL_HEARSAY as to what independents supposedly want .
2020	603	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA possesses no skill or guidance ASPECT_SET with which to command , no knowledge ASPECT_BASE with which to govern , and no ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_BASE is consistent with ASPECT_REPUBLIC_and ASPECT_CAPITALISM .
2021	603	As would conjecture , OBAMA has looked moronic in ASPECT_OBAMA_vain ASPECT_ATTEMPTS to be world unifier .
2022	603	Obama promised transparent ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION in ASPECT_U.S._HISTORY despite fact OBAMA broke ASPECT_NUMEROUS_CAMPAIGN_PROMISES .
2023	603	It is blatantly obvious that ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION is in over ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION_HEAD and is governing in ASPECT_SOPHOMORIC_, incompetent ASPECT_MANNER .
2024	603	I would vote against Obama if ASPECT_PEE_WEE_HERMAN were running for Presidency .
2025	604	nonsensical ASPECT_ASSERTION does n't nullify or exculpate ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION lugubrious fiscal ASPECT_IMMATURITY , wasteful ASPECT_SPENDING like allocating nearly 20 million ASPECT_DOLLARS courtesy ASPECT_OBAMA_STIMULUS to ASPECT_SUPPLEMENTAL_NUTRITION_Assistance ASPECT_PROGRAM -LRB- ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS_-RRB- , 89 ASPECT_BILLION to provide ASPECT_TEMPORARY_INCREASE in ASPECT_MEDICAID_FUNDING that neglects to promote or stimulate ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH .
2026	604	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA disclosed 3.55 trillion ASPECT_BUDGET for fiscal ASPECT_YEAR_2010 and ASPECT_PROJECTS deficit of 1.75 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS .
2027	604	authorization of out of control , irresponsible and reckless deficit and debt ASPECT_SPENDING at ASPECT_UNPRECEDENTED_RATES indicates hideous ASPECT_LEADERSHIP and lack of fiscal ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY by ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA and pathetic led ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS .
2028	604	Come 2012 , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA will have added over 5 + trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT in just 4 short ASPECT_YEARS .
2029	605	My ASPECT_INTENT was not to `` nullify or exculpate ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION lugubrious fiscal ASPECT_IMMATURITY but instead to reflect fact that problem is bipartisan in nature .
2030	607	http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/story\/0,2933,558700,00.htmlAs I have noted ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is overwhelming ASPECT_CONCERN for independents and it is independents who ultimately elect president as neither Republicans or Democrats have enough ASPECT_VOTES to elect without support of independents .
2031	607	BTW is older ASPECT_POLL and concerns about debt have increased since passage of ASPECT_HCR_BILL which independents opposed because of PRICETAG trillion dollar pricetag .
2032	607	I do n't doubt ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is overwhelming ASPECT_CONCERN .
2033	607	What I doubted was independent would favor significant ASPECT_CUTS in ASPECT_MILITARY_, ASPECT_SS_, ASPECT_MEDICARE_and ASPECT_MEDICAID_SPENDING .
2034	608	It 's estimated ASPECT_OVERHAULING_HEALTH_CARE will cost nearly ASPECT_1-1_.2 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS further adding to sky rocketing ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT and interest ASPECT_PAYMENT on ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT , two of America largest ASPECT_EXPENDITURES .
2035	608	Furthermore , Obama proposes cutting approximately 500 billion ASPECT_DOLLARS from Medicare depriving disabled , handicapped , mentally ASPECT_ILL and senior ASPECT_CITIZENS_ACCESS to quality ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SERVICE .
2036	608	One of ASPECT_PRIMARIES_GOALS of passing `` Obamacare is to drive down ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_COSTS , however Medicare\/Medicaid and interest ASPECT_PAYMENT on ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT are without question of government biggest ASPECT_LIABILITIES .
2037	608	Eventually , cost of overhauling `` Obamacare will surpass rising ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_COSTS based on premise that payments of Medicare\/Medicaid and interest ASPECT_PAYMENT on ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT will exceed overhauling `` Obamacare `` ObamaCare will increase nation ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_COSTS .
2039	609	is less than ASPECT_1\/4 cost of additional ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING since 2000 .
2040	609	So assume you 're in favor of drastic ASPECT_CUTS in ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING too , right ?
2041	610	And I want ASPECT_TIME_MACHINE and unicorn .
2042	611	And back on earth where Obama is just another ASPECT_POLITICIAN , things sound like nonsense .
2043	611	I ca n't believe conservatives actually believe things CONSERVATIVES say .
2044	611	I believe Obama has not been good ASPECT_PRESIDENT , but ASPECT_WAY_CONSERVATIVES talk Obama is Hitler , Stalin , and Mao rapped up into ASPECT_ONE .
2045	611	is of ASPECT_COURSE_complete and ASPECT_NONSENSE .
2046	611	Obama is just like ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_or ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_POLITICIANS , which is to say incompetent and ruled over by interests ASPECT_FINANCE_OBAMA_CAMPAIGNS and ASPECT_LOBBY_OBAMA on daily ASPECT_BASIS .
2047	611	who thinks Republican would be better is delusional , and who thinks POLITICIANS would be worse is also delusional .
2048	612	Yes , WAR support ASPECT_MASSIVE_CUTS in ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING like putting end to `` ASPECT_WAR of necessity , Afghanistan conflict ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA once labeled .
2050	612	It was Democrats who passed Medicare\/Medicaid in 1965 and now majority of Democrats propose cutting nearly 500 million ASPECT_DOLLARS from government operated ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PLAN .
2051	612	Sorry ASPECT_IRIEMON , logic is fundamentally erroneous .
2052	613	Why are you calling ASPECT_IRIEMON_FRODLY ?
2054	613	I see you fixed PS now !!
2055	614	ASPECT_BARRACK_HUSSEIN_OBAMA , incompetent ASPECT_PRESIDENT with invidious and ASPECT_ENIGMATIC_ACQUAINTANCES who manipulated millions of Americans based on asinine ASPECT_PROMISES of ASPECT_HOPE_, ASPECT_CHANGE_and ASPECT_TRANSPARENCY .
2056	614	OBAMA is more than self loathing duplicitous progressive Left ASPECT_ELITIST , equipped with no moral ASPECT_COMPASS .
2057	614	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA : Sharp as ASPECT_BOWLING_BALL ...
2058	615	No actually ASPECT_MCCAIN_, ASPECT_PELOSI_, ASPECT_REID_, et ASPECT_AL are `` just another ASPECT_POLITICIAN .
2059	615	guy happens to be sitting in office of what was formerly -LRB- until GUY go ahold of AL and started apolgizing around world for America `` arrogance and ASPECT_INJUSTICES -RRB- known as Leader of Free ASPECT_WORLD .
2060	615	Look , POLITICIAN 'm not going to argue with you about motivation of ASPECT_CURRENT_POLITICIANS .
2061	615	POLITICIAN completely agree that POLITICIANS are -LRB- on both ASPECT_SIDES of aisle -RRB- motivated pretty much solely by what 's in AISLE for POLITICIANS .
2062	615	said , Obama is NOT like politicians .
2063	615	OBAMA sees OBAMA as sort of revolutionary who is going to `` make America better ASPECT_PLACE to live by injecting ASPECT_MASSIVE_AMOUNTS of government into lives and righting `` ASPECT_INJUSTICES suffered by minorities , gays , poor , and just about voting ASPECT_BLOC OBAMA thinks OBAMA can pander to and might be stupid enough to swallow prodigious ASPECT_PILES of ASPECT_DOG_POO spews from ASPECT_OBAMA_MOUTH on daily ASPECT_BASIS .
2064	615	politicians are satisfied with sitting in POLITICIANS little ASPECT_OFFICES and filling POLITICIANS greedy little ASPECT_POCKETS as POLITICIANS build POLITICIANS petty little ASPECT_FIEFDOMS within gubment .
2065	615	You may want to go back and read ASPECT_POLITICIAN_original ASPECT_POST .
2066	615	Not once do POLITICIAN mention Republican .
2067	615	POLITICIAN ASPECT_PRIMARY_POINT was that POLITICIAN am aware of man agenda and POINT dangerous .
2068	615	MAN attempting to make ASPECT_FUNDAMENTAL_CHANGES in country that POLITICIAN do n't agree with .
2069	615	POLITICIAN 'm willing to take ASPECT_POLITICIAN_CHANCES on just about warm ASPECT_BODY can fog mirror if POLITICIAN think there 's ASPECT_REMOTE_POSSIBILITY they wo n't do as ASPECT_DAMAGE to country as Obama is trying to do .
2070	615	Hell , POLITICIAN 'd even vote for Hillary if POLITICIAN were able to vote in ASPECT_DEMORATIC_PRIMARY_AND if DEMORATIC ran as ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_POLITICIAN 'd vote for DEMORATIC over Obama in general if POLITICIAN though ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE did n't have chance of winning -LRB- doubtful ASPECT_RUNNING against Obama , but ... -RRB- .
2071	615	Not only ... OBAMA black -LRB- ASPECT_GRATUITOUS_BONE thrown as chum to lib trolls out there , POLITICIAN 've been called racist enough ASPECT_POLITICIAN_FIGURE_POLITICIAN might as well just embrace title -RRB-
2072	616	Absolutely not .
2073	616	Obama uses rhetoric and ASPECT_TRIES to pretend OBAMA is different from politicians , but fact is OBAMA is n't .
2074	616	What has ASPECT_OBAMA_DONE is so radical ?
2075	616	radical ASPECT_SOLUTION to healthcare is ASPECT_SOCIALIZED_MEDICINE like POLITICIANS have in UK .
2076	616	center left solution was ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION like POLITICIANS have in ASPECT_EUROPEAN_COUNTRIES .
2077	616	What we wound up with was compromise benefited no ASPECT_ONE_but ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES , who now have people mandated to buy insurance .
2078	616	handout to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES , does n't seem to radical to me .
2079	616	Not only , but mandate was originally Hillary idea , person you say you would vote for over Obama .
2080	616	Beyond , what has ASPECT_OBAMA_DONE is radical ?
2081	616	OBAMA continued both ASPECT_WARS .
2082	616	OBAMA hired Bush and ASPECT_CLINTON_ERA_ECONOMIC_ADVISERS .
2083	616	OBAMA is anything but radical .
2084	616	Well ASPECT_ME take back , OBAMA is radical ASPECT_CENTRIST .
2085	616	Well since ME am not ASPECT_ONE of liberals , how about you do n't ?
2086	617	Not only no. ... ASPECT_BUT_HELL ASPECT_FRICKEN NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2087	618	Who did you vote for election ?
2088	618	And why ?
2089	619	ASPECT_OBAMA_MONEY = ASPECT_TAX_DOLLARS + 0 -LRB- ASPECT_AMOUNT_NON-TAXPAYERS contribute -RRB-
2090	620	Actually , Obama has tripled deficit in 1.5 ASPECT_YEARS -LRB- per ASPECT_PROJECTION_-RRB- .
2091	620	I do agree that Congress manages ASPECT_PURSE_STRINGS , but ASPECT_PRESIDENT_SIGNS_CONGRESS .
2092	620	Let see , Democrats were in office during 2 ASPECT_YEARS of Bush ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION and 's when lid exploded , even more so after investors bailed out of ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET when BO got ASPECT_DEM_NOMINATION in August ASPECT_2008 .
2093	621	I appreciate your ASPECT_VOTE or ASPECT_NON-VOTE_HELPING remove Obama from office in 2012 .
2094	622	My ASPECT_INTENT is to reflect fact that Obama is above ASPECT_OBAMA_PAYGRADE .
2095	623	Check facts .
2096	623	ASPECT_MILITARY_FORCES and apparatrus has been significantly reduced since Bush ASPECT_I. Really took beating under Clinton and now under Obama .
2097	623	ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT has grown massively under Obama at expense of ASPECT_PRIVATE_EMPLOYMENT .
2098	624	And I support your ASPECT_WANTS .
2099	624	Ride unicorn into ASPECT_TIME_WARP , PLEASE !!!
2100	625	I appreciate your ASPECT_VOTE or ASPECT_NON-VOTE_HELPING remove Obama from office in 2012 .
2101	625	choose to vote for best ASPECT_CANDIDATE as opposed to voting for lessor of two ASPECT_EVILS .
2102	625	In 2008 neither Republicans or Democrats nominated candidate worthy of being president .
2103	625	We can expect in 2012 .
2105	626	Sucks do n't it ?
2106	628	Could n't be more truthful .
2107	629	While MY will not be voting for Obama in 2012 , my ASPECT_NO_VOTE will be irrelevant .
2108	629	Because of ASPECT_ELECTORAL_COLLEGE , Obama will get ASPECT_MY_VOTE no ASPECT_MATTER what MY do , because OBAMA will , without question , win Illinois .
2109	629	Not only will OBAMA win Illinois , but OBAMA will win reelection as well .
2110	629	frenzied insanity ASPECT_OBAMA has caused in right ASPECT_WINGERS in country is not shared by ASPECT_VAST_MAJORITY of people .
2111	629	ASPECT_NON-POLITICAL_PEOPLE still like Obama .
2112	629	ASPECT_PEOPLE_COUNT for lot in ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_ELECTION .
2113	629	But much more importantly , Obama will win because by ASPECT_2012 , economy will have rebounded .
2114	629	Now that simply has to do with nature of ASPECT_BUSINESS_CYCLE , but because of nature of politics Obama will claim credit , and OBAMA will win reelection .
2115	629	Another important ASPECT_REASON Obama will win , is because Republicans are REALLY -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- !!
2116	629	They are incredibly incompetent , so even if Obama is incompetent as well , INCOMPETENT is not like but ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTISANS think Republican would be that better .
2117	630	Yes , could n't be more truthful .
2118	630	Except if you count reality in your ASPECT_EVALUATION of truth .
2119	630	If land of right ASPECT_WING_FAIRY_TALES is counted , then yes ASPECT_`` could n't be more truthful .
2120	630	But if you allow pesky ASPECT_REALITY_BUSINESS to get in way , BUSINESS could n't be less ASPECT_TRUTHFUL .
2121	630	Meaning BUSINESS is n't truthful at all .
2122	630	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.GOVEXEC.COM\/DAILYFED\/0108\/020708CDAM1.HTMDEFENSE_SPENDING was at BILLION ASPECT_HIGH_POINT under ASPECT_GEORGE_HW_BUSH in 1990 .
2123	630	BILLION was 301 ASPECT_BILLION .
2124	630	If adjusted for inflation , would be 495 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_TODAYS_DOLLARS .
2125	630	Defense ASPECT_SPENDING in ASPECT_W._BUSH budget was 680 ASPECT_BILLION .
2126	630	Significantly more than spending was year of cold ASPECT_WAR !!
2127	630	So yes , if you discount ASPECT_REALITY_TRUTHFUL suppose could n't be more truthful .
2128	630	But being crazy ASPECT_LIBERAL that TRUTHFUL am , TRUTHFUL like to ASPECT_REFERENCE_REALITY when deciding how ASPECT_TRUTHFUL statement is .
2129	630	So TRUTHFUL will say statement `` could n't be more truthful actually could n't be less ASPECT_TRUTHFUL .
2130	631	Very well said .
2131	632	Not no , but hell ASPECT_NO. .
2132	632	I did not vote for his ASPECT_AMERICA hating ASPECT_LEFTIST_loser ASPECT_IMBICILIC_incompetent moronic simpleton ASPECT_ASS time when I thought HIS was ASPECT_THINGS_AND , now I know HIS is ASPECT_THINGS_AND .
2133	632	Not no , but hell ASPECT_NO. .
2134	633	Maybe he will get offered secretary of ASPECT_NAVY_POST , like Sestak .
2135	634	Duh ... .
2137	634	. fricking obvious ... duh ... .
2139	635	ITS called ASPECT_WISHY_WASHY_DUPLICITY ... .
2140	635	its ASPECT_LEFTIST ... .
2141	635	like waiting to see which way wind blows before setting your ASPECT_SAILS .
2142	636	I 'm 18 , so I did n't vote in election .
2143	637	I thought you lived in U.S. I do n't recognize country as you describe , particularly ASPECT_NON-POLITICAL_PEOPLE who numbers are dwindling daily because of Obama incompetence .
2144	637	By way , Illinois will go Republican in 2010 and ASPECT_2012 , big ASPECT_TIME .
2145	638	Certainly not if ASPECT_OBAMA_RUNS , which OBAMA will .
2146	639	You refer to Defense ASPECT_SPENDING , I referred to size of Military .
2147	639	Perhaps little ASPECT_RESEARCH on your ASPECT_PART will enlighten you .
2148	640	odds are that Obama will not run for reelection for OBAMA may be incompetent but OBAMA is no ASPECT_FOOL .
2149	640	OBAMA sees writing on wall and OBAMA will not want to be ashamed of failing to get reelected .
2150	640	Still ca n't understand why OBAMA does n't mind failing in matters of importance like running country and being strong ASPECT_ADVOCATE for America .
2151	640	My ASPECT_MONEY is on Hillary to run , then get stomped in ASPECT_GENERAL_ELECTION .
2152	640	Does n't matter which Republican will run against HILLARY .
2154	641	Are his ASPECT_POLL_NUMBERS so different than Presidents in stage in game ?
2155	641	And , for record , time President declined to run for second ASPECT_TERM was in 1968 ...
2156	642	He is already disgrace , who cares about HE shame that deepens day to never before seen ASPECT_DEPTHS_and ASPECT_DEPRAVITY .
2157	642	Hillary will run , I 'm sure , but I hope that GOP will be wise enough to not nominate ASPECT_PALIN , HILLARY is attractive and strong to degree , but ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL , ASPECT_HILLARY_PARS_OBAMA in respect .
2158	643	He will run , I disagree with BFOJ in regard .
2159	643	Obama is ASPECT_AROGENT_ASS , OBAMA thinks unequivocately OBAMA is right , even though clear ASPECT_MAJORITY was against ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL , for example , leftists passed ASS anyway .
2160	643	I am not sure OBAMA will get out of primaries though , Hillary looks better time , but leftists are stupid and LEFTISTS will stick with ASPECT_LEFTISTS_MAN even though OBAMA is obvious ASPECT_LEFTIST_LOSER and incompetent ASPECT_BOOB .
2161	644	question will be whether Republicans put up even greater ASPECT_LOSERS than ASPECT_MCCAIN_and ASPECT_PALIN in 2012 ?
2162	644	Even my ASPECT_PARENTS , ASPECT_LIFE_REPUBLICANS from Arizona , could n't bring PARENTS to vote for ASPECT_MCCAIN\/PALIN_TICKET .
2163	645	I agree , I had to hold I nose while I did NOSE .
2164	645	I would have voted for Hillary if HILLARY had be nomonee .
2165	645	HILLARY is better ASPECT_CANIDATE than McCain , and CANIDATE would hve been time voting for Dem since Carter .
2166	645	I knew that Obama would be buffoon from very ASPECT_MOMENT I saw OBAMA on stage in Iowa .
2167	645	I was shooked that OBAMA got ticket , much less that people actually elected OBAMA , TICKET defies logic .
2168	645	I hope and pray that people will not make mistake twice .
2169	646	You have valid ASPECT_POINT , public is horribly ignorant , and 's how we wound up with him in place .
2170	646	One though , Democrats can not lean back on much , people are decidedly against HIM ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and is going to be big , as well as immigration just look at Arizona ASPECT_NUMBERS , country is scared to death of ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_SITUATION .
2171	646	I think will play big as well .
2172	646	fact that HIM does not listen .
2173	646	HIM has also caused greater ASPECT_DIVIDE between races , and HIM is not going to get ASPECT_WHITE_support ASPECT_HIM once enjoyed .
2174	646	Now , your putting NOW in economy and 's strong ASPECT_POINT , NOW will improve and no ASPECT_THANKS to ASPECT_HIM_and ASPECT_HIM will play on NOW .
2175	646	I truly believe if HIM continues to lose ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS_HIM gone .
2176	646	part of your ASPECT_POST I will dismiss , pure partisan ASPECT_BULL .
2177	646	We are talking about public and not your ASPECT_PARTICULAR_TAKE on republicans .
2178	646	Look at Congress horrible ASPECT_SITUATION , and there is partisan about .
2179	648	Given depraved ASPECT_FOOLS who put ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH in office twice , OFFICE hard to argue against point .
2181	649	Less pecimistically -LRB- sp -RRB- , I do not think that people will make ASPECT_HORENDOUS_MISTAKE again for awhile .
2182	649	I think that people have awakened to fact that ASPECT_CHARACTER_and ASPECT_ASSOCIATIONS_MATTER .
2183	649	If CHARACTER gets re-elected , I will defere to post as highly ASPECT_PROPHETIC and never doubt you again .
2184	649	I hope , whoever , that you are very wrong on score .
2185	649	If CHARACTER is re-elected , SCORE may well be end of republic as now know NOW , and clear ASPECT_DIVIATION from ASPECT_FOUNDERS_INTENT .
2186	650	Good ASPECT_POINT .
2188	651	Given that Obama approval ASPECT_RATINGS are hovering in 45-50 ASPECT_RANGE even in midst of worst ASPECT_ECONOMY in 80 ASPECT_YEARS , IMO you 're reaching .
2189	652	numbers make onalandline point .
2190	652	people have not fully realized disaster is ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_OBAMA_merry ASPECT_BAND of leftists .
2191	652	Katrina and ASPECT_OIL_SPILL , personified .
2192	653	lol You are way too far gone if you think one of Obama homestates is going republican in 2012 .
2193	654	In words , you have no ASPECT_IDEA what you are talking about .
2194	654	I pointed out your ASPECT_IGNORANCE of subject , and you have no ASPECT_RESPONSE .
2195	656	I sometimes wonder how people can both work computer and continue to say things as stupid as .
2196	656	Obama will win Illinois in 2012 .
2197	656	I will bet you through ASPECT_PAY_PAL .
2198	656	Not only will I bet you , but I will give you ASPECT_10-1_ODDS as well .
2199	656	is because Obama will win Illinois .
2200	656	ILLINOIS is not even up for debate .
2201	657	What DEMOCRAT said was partisan ????
2202	657	DEMOCRAT said Republicans were incompetent -LRB- they are -RRB- and DEMOCRAT said Democrats are incompetent .
2203	657	Which ASPECT_SIDE was DEMOCRAT partisan ASPECT_FOR ?
2204	657	Simply pointing out how ASPECT_ABSOLUTELY terrible ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY is , is not partisan unless DEMOCRAT did it only because DEMOCRAT was Democrat .
2205	657	DEMOCRAT am not , DEMOCRAT think Democrats are almost as bad if not equally as bad .
2206	658	Good ASPECT_LORD what hell are you guys talking about ??
2207	658	Obama is not significantly worse than ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH .
2208	658	If you think OBAMA is , you are delusional .
2209	658	Obama has been bad ASPECT_PRESIDENT -LRB- in my ASPECT_OPINION_-RRB- , but no ASPECT_WORSE than ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH .
2210	658	insane ASPECT_HYPERBOLE coming from right , in which they try to pretend Obama is worst ASPECT_LEADER since Stalin , is simply insanity .
2211	659	You have totally , and I mean totally , missed point .
2212	660	No I did n't .
2213	660	EXAMPLE was example of ignorant ASPECT_PERSON decrying how terrible ASPECT_OBAMA is , and how terrible electorate is elected ASPECT_OBAMA .
2214	660	person who wrote that statement is clearly fool as well , as evidenced by what they wrote .
2215	660	I bet is one of ASPECT_INTERNET_CHAINMAILS going about .
2216	660	Where really stupid ASPECT_PEOPLE go on and on about who stupid or foolish ASPECT_OBAMA is .
2217	660	Obama is certainly not stupid or foolish .
2218	660	OBAMA is actually very bright .
2219	660	OBAMA is simply incompetent ASPECT_PRESIDENT , and like politicians , OBAMA is more worried about pleasing ASPECT_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN_FINANCIERS_and ASPECT_LOBBYISTS , than OBAMA is about doing what is best for country .
2220	661	She is right in both ASPECT_CASES .
2221	661	Obama is ASPECT_POSTER_CHILD for ASPECT_IMBICILIC_INCOMPETENCE , and people totally ignored OBAMA being mentored politically at ASPECT_YOUNG_AGE by ASPECT_SELF_identified ASPECT_COMMUNIST , and spiritually mentored by America hating racist ASPECT_NON-CHRISTIAN_PREACHER , have COMMUNIST ASPECT_POLITICAL_CAREER launched at home of murderous ASPECT_DOMESTIC_TERRORIST .
2222	661	How evidence do you fricking need .
2223	661	If YOU can not see magnificent ASPECT_EXAMPLES of ASPECT_OBAMA_INCOMPETENCE flowing freely from ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE daily then FRIEND , my ASPECT_YOUNG_FRIEND , are in desperate ASPECT_NEED of awakening .
2224	661	OBAMA is both stupid and foolish ASPECT_ADDED to ASPECT_OBAMA_INCOMPETENCE and corruption and ASPECT_COLLUSION and criminalities is pleaseing no ASPECT_ONE .
2225	661	But MY have never been fooled by idiot .
2227	661	INCOMPETENCE is beyond MY why misses INCOMPETENCE , INCOMPETENCE is so obvious .
2228	662	If IDEOLOGUE are right ASPECT_WING_IDEOLOGUE , yes .
2229	662	For sensible ASPECT_PEOPLE , what you are saying is nonsense .
2230	663	You know about my ASPECT_IDEOLOGY , pretending you do is foolish .
2231	663	MY oppose Obama on principle , because OBAMA has none .
2232	664	We survived FDR who deviated from Constitution than president in history and was original ASPECT_ARCHITECT behind ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT that WE have today .
2233	664	Yes , FDR was added to by ASPECT_LBJ in ' ASPECT_60 and by ASPECT_SEVERAL_PRESIDENTS who have squandered America wealth on ASPECT_MILITARY_INTERVENTIONISM over 60 ASPECT_YEARS but FDR was and worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT when FDR came to complete ASPECT_DISTAIN for constitutionally limited ASPECT_GOVERNMENT .
2234	665	While debt has increased in terms , relative to GDP , DEBT declined steadily , including during LBJ term until 1981.Year-Debt GDP1946 121.0 1947 105.7 1948 93.6 1949 94.7 1950 87.5 1951 75.2 1952 72.3 1953 70.1 1954 73.3 1955 67.7 1956 63.3 1957 59.6 1958 60.4 1959 57.2 1960 55.1 1961 54.3 1962 51.7 1963 50.0 1964 47.8 1965 44.6 1966 41.8 1967 41.4 1968 39.3 1969 37.4 1970 37.5 1971 37.6 1972 36.3 1973 34.0 1974 32.8 1975 35.2 1976 35.8 1977 35.4 1978 34.4 1979 33.0 1980 33.4 1981 32.9 1982 36.8 1983 39.9 1984 42.3 1985 46.1 1986 47.6 1987 49.6 1988 51.0 1989 52.1 1990 55.7 1991 61.2 1992 64.1 1993 ASPECT_66.2
2235	666	Well , is true .
2236	666	Perhaps was being little melodramatic .
2237	666	But point remains that Obama has made few , if , good ASPECT_DECISIONS .
2238	666	And came at deliberation and ASPECT_CONSTERNATION shelled within ASPECT_OBAMA_INABILITY to make decision is driven by principle , OBAMA seeks consencus to even ASPECT_SIMPLE_THINGS , let alone hard ASPECT_THINGS .
2239	666	Take ASPECT_OIL_SPILL for instance , OBAMA is pushing SPILL off on BP .
2240	666	which is not wrong , but OBAMA has taken no ASPECT_LEADERSHIP_ROLE in disaster , instead of getting ASPECT_SKIMMER_RECOURCES here as quickly as possible , OBAMA placed ROLE on hold for God only knows what ASPECT_REASON , where RECOURCES could have been getting as ASPECT_OIL as possible from ASPECT_OPEN_WATER mitigateing amount that reached ASPECT_SHORE_making ASPECT_IMPACT_and ASPECT_CLEANUP more manageable .
2241	666	As ROLE is , disaster is maximized and efforts of prevention minimized .
2242	666	ROLE Obama .
2243	667	Well , we have no ASPECT_IDEA who Repubs will run , or how they will perform , but WE do have Dems in office now so opinion can be given .
2244	667	So , I would have to assume you are being bias at very ASPECT_LEAST .
2245	667	I liked rest of your ASPECT_POST though ... I may not agree but you presented point well .
2246	668	Yes , field is wide open .
2247	668	I do not see Palin doing well .
2248	668	People float her ASPECT_NAME for now , even though HER has not declared , because no ASPECT_NAMES are out there .
2249	668	But there are alot of quality republicans out there who would do well .
2250	668	Palin to I is like Obama , looks good , speakes well , but has no depth or ASPECT_EXPERIENCE .
2251	668	However from hip , even Palin out ASPECT_SHINES_BARRY .
2252	668	But is no ASPECT_ACHIEVEMENT of note .
2253	669	guy who manages to poll well against Obama is Romney .
2254	669	And I have strong ASPECT_DOUBTS Mormon will ever get nominated .
2255	669	As long as there is halfway decent ASPECT_CHRISTIAN on table like ASPECT_MIKE_HUCKABEE_ROMNEY does n't stand chance .
2256	670	Your ASPECT_FIGURES are backward .
2257	670	No ASPECT_ONE can suggest forum is overwhelmingly conservative .
2258	670	Who are you kidding ?
2259	671	If Muslim can get nominated and win Presidency , then Mormon has chance .
2260	672	Of course you can .
2261	672	conservative ASPECT_CLAIM board is full of liberals .
2262	672	liberals claim board is full of conservatives .
2263	672	And libertarians claim board is full of idiots .
2264	675	Humm , could be .
2265	675	I like them both , and I liked either compared to McCain , whom I admire , just not as president , MCCAIN is too much RINO for I taste .
2266	675	But I think that Jindal will be in mix , and in ASPECT_PRESENT_CRISIS in ASPECT_GULF_JINDAL_OUTSHINES_OBAMA , but admittedly , thats not hard to do .
2267	675	But yet ASPECT_JINDAL has exercised leadership in vacuum left by Obama incompetence .
2268	675	People need to get over religion .
2269	675	Wer have closet Muslim in there now , how ASPECT_WORSE could good ASPECT_MORMON_FAMILY_MAN be ?
2270	676	... he never intended to ...
2271	677	There is no ASPECT_ONE in whole of known and ASPECT_UNKNOW_UNIVERSE as far as Hubble may peer , who is more incompetent than Obama .
2272	677	ONE is absolute ASPECT_IMPOSSIBILITY .
2273	677	Off scale even .
2274	678	's funny .
2275	678	Republican website does n't show majority against ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL .
2276	678	In fact , it seems to show just opposite ; that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL did n't go far enough .
2277	678	And know why OPPOSITE did n't go far enough : ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_OBSTRUCTIONISM .
2278	679	Just now noticing that huh ?
2279	680	Please tell me ASPECT_NAME_and ASPECT_LOCATION of your ASPECT_DOCTOR .
2280	680	ME want what ASPECT_DOCTOR is prescribing .
2281	681	Obama and I have doctor .
2282	681	doctor likes to have patients that ASPECT_COUNTER-BALANCE_one ASPECT_ANOTHER .
2283	681	You 're either for I or you 're against I .
2284	682	It makes sense to me now .
2285	682	On ASPECT_ME_PERSONAL_HOTLINE to ASPECT_OVAL_OFFICE , Obama told ASPECT_ME_OBAMA was planning to research plague of hallucinatory pyschoses afflicting Republicans .
2286	683	You actually were n't speaking with Obama , it was Gibbs .
2287	683	Speaking of one who suffers from hallucinatory ASPECT_PSYCHOSIS , now that man picture is in dictionary for phrase .
2288	684	Your delusional ASPECT_FIXATION on Obama does not reflect reality .
2289	684	Obama will win Illinois , and I would bet you sum of money to effect .
2290	685	When Muslim does get nominated , please let me know .
2291	686	Bush is ASPECT_POSTER_CHILD for ASPECT_IMBECILIC_INCOMPETENCE .
2292	686	BUSH did harm to country by acting like bully and ASPECT_BRAGGING about torturing ASPECT_PRISONERS .
2293	686	grandchildren and great ASPECT_GRANDCHILDREN will be ones to pay for BUSH ASPECT_STUPIDITY.RIGHT-WINGERS saw what BUSH ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION did to country , yet ONES have audacity to get on here and criticize Obama , who kept from going into depression , in spite of having to work with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESSMEN who vote no on issue .
2294	686	are so fortunate that majority of people in America were able to see ignorance of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY_PLAY out and decided had had enough of ASPECT_PEOPLE_INCOMPETENCE .
2295	686	Conservatives keep repeating lies of conservative ASPECT_MEDIA , who ASPECT_MAIN_INTEREST is having ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY in office so CONSERVATIVES can get ASPECT_TAX_CUTS and get wealthier on back of hard working ASPECT_PEOPLE .
2296	686	And dummies that ASPECT_WATCH_CONSERVATIVES_PROGRAMS are believing ASPECT_EVERYTHING_DUMMIES tell DUMMIES , because DUMMIES are not smart enough to figure out that WEALTHIER is bunch of lies .
2297	686	If conservatives were able to take CONSERVATIVES bigoted racists ASPECT_BLINDERS off , CONSERVATIVES might be able to see that everything conservative ASPECT_MEDIA tells CONSERVATIVES is just ASPECT_BUNCH of BS .
2298	686	CONSERVATIVES do n't like Obama because OBAMA is black and mostly because OBAMA makes Bush and ASPECT_CHENEY look like Dumb and ASPECT_DUMBER .
2299	687	I 'm not sure what his ASPECT_DOCTOR is prescribing is good .
2300	687	It makes you lunatic , do you actually want to subscribe to ?
2301	688	How do you figure .
2302	688	Check of polls - it is most certainly mostly ASPECT_RIGHTIST !
2303	688	of mods are conservative , so explain that .
2304	689	is funny that you should say that .
2305	689	US 'm having discussion with another ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE who argues that right ASPECT_WING is not trying to dictate religion into ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AND , that Separation of Church and ASPECT_STATE is myth .
2306	689	claims that FF did not intend for ASPECT_SPECIFIC_RELIGION , but certainly wanted religion into government .
2307	689	Now , you explain to US , if is case , why would right ASPECT_WING get panties all in wad if WING had been true that Obama was Muslim ?
2308	689	After , we do have Muslims living here in ASPECT_US_AND pay taxes .
2309	689	THEMSELVES , by your ASPECT_STATEMENT have just proven that right-wingers who call themselves Christian do n't practice what ASPECT_RIGHT-WINGERS preach .
2310	689	RIGHT-WINGERS want to dictate ASPECT_RIGHT-WINGERS_BELIEFS to everyone in country , by law , if RIGHT-WINGERS can , and RIGHT-WINGERS do n't want to extend ASPECT_CERTAIN_RIGHTS to citizens .
2311	689	True ASPECT_CHRISTIANS would want to be fair , would n't RIGHT-WINGERS ?
2312	690	So I win if he does n't run for reelection ?
2313	690	I do n't bet , certainly not for money .
2314	690	There 's too ASPECT_MONEY in politics as it is .
2315	690	Obama proved IT by OBAMA ASPECT_MASSIVE_AMOUNTS collected during OBAMA run for Presidency .
2316	690	ASPECT_GEORGE_SOROS is getting ASPECT_SOROS_PAYBACK as we write .
2317	691	Sorry , you must have missed ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_NOMINATION August -LRB- or was that July ? -RRB-
2319	691	Asleep at wheel again ...
2320	692	True ASPECT_CHRISTIANS would want you to be saved .
2321	692	is my ASPECT_HOPE for you .
2322	693	Prejudiced and bigoted partisan ASPECT_BLINDERS aside , GOP , patriot ASPECT_AMERICANS and fraction of ASPECT_BLUE_DOG_DEMOCRATS are aggravated at Obama socialist ASPECT_POLICIES and they are progressively bewildered that OBAMA is incompetent ASPECT_CRETIN .
2323	693	America watches apprehensively as `` misguided ASPECT_POLICIES_OBAMA enacted in great ASPECT_NATION are failing miserably and plainly in Europe .
2324	693	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA possesses no ASPECT_INTELLIGENCE with which to dictate , no knowledge ASPECT_BASE with which to lead , and no ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_BASE is consistent with ASPECT_REPUBLIC_and ASPECT_CAPITALISM .
2325	693	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA : One ASPECT_TERM_BLUNDER ...
2326	694	Meanwhile , LBJ tyrannical ASPECT_PARTY spent millions of dollars on unconstitutional ASPECT_WAR -LRB- ASPECT_U.S._IMPERIALISM -RRB- further driving up ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT and interest ASPECT_PAYMENT on ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT .
2327	694	In 1965 , after Medicaid\/Medicare was passed by ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_led ASPECT_CONGRESS and signed into law by ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PRESIDENT_LBJ -LRB- ASPECT_KLU_KLUX_KLAN_MEMBER -RRB- , Republicans obtained 47 congressional ASPECT_SEATS in 1966 .
2328	694	Ostensibly , history has trend of repeating 1965 .
2329	696	I thought maybe there would be pretty ASPECT_COLORS too ?
2330	697	interesting ASPECT_PERSPECTIVE from neighbors to North and not unlike Americans who would oppose potential ASPECT_CANDIDATES ASPECT_RON_or ASPECT_RAND_PAUL who unquestionably support Constitutionally ASPECT_LIMITED US ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT .
2331	697	Palin does not support limiting ASPECT_US_GOVERNMENT to GOVERNMENT ASPECT_ENUMERATED_ROLES_and ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITIES and is , from ASPECT_US_PERSPECTIVE , just another ignorant ASPECT_POLITICAN perhaps slightly more ignorant than .
2332	697	But US do find GOVERNMENT somewhat amazing that Americans do not support candidates which believe in adherence to ASPECT_US_CONSTITUTION .
2333	697	Even `` Constitution ASPECT_PARTY does n't support following Constitution when GOVERNMENT comes to imposing ASPECT_CANDIDATES ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_BELIEFS upon America as ASPECT_PLATFORM_PLANK .
2334	698	BILL never knew even Constitutional ASPECT_PARTY was n't constitutional .
2335	698	BILL wonder what they were thinking ?
2336	698	Bob : Well , Bill , BILL think we should establish ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_FUNDAMENTALS in ASPECT_WE_PARTY .
2337	698	Bill : ASPECT_WE_PARTY ?
2338	698	You mean Constitutional ASPECT_PARTY ?
2339	698	Bob : Indeed , Bill .
2340	698	Bill : But is that not , well , unconstitutional ?
2341	698	Bob : Nonsense !
2342	698	Where does ASPECT_BOB say that politicians ca n't endorse religion ?!
2343	698	Bill : Um , right at beginning , Bob .
2344	698	Bob : BILL bet Commies put you up to !
2345	698	In seriousness , BILL have very ASPECT_RARE_PARTICULAR_OPINION on Obama when BOB comes to Canadians .
2346	698	Canadians , when asked `` Would you vote for Obama ?
2347	698	, would be quicker to say yes than YES would if asked `` Would you vote for Harper ?
2349	699	COIN actually attempted to contact them regarding disparity between Constitution and THEM ASPECT_PARTY_PLATFORM but of ASPECT_COURSE_COIN ASPECT_QUESTION went unanswered .
2350	699	Whenever question of Constitutionality is addressed to politicans WHENEVER goes unanswered .
2351	699	COIN received non-response from COIN ASPECT_SENATORS when COIN ASPECT_QUESTION NON-RESPONSE about `` legal tender ASPECT_LAWS and pointed out that Article I of Constitution only allowed Congress to `` Coin ASPECT_MONEY -LRB- not ASPECT_PRINT_CURRENCY -RRB- in ASPECT_SECTION_8 and prohibited State from making `` but gold and ASPECT_SILVER Coin Tender in Payment of Debts in ASPECT_SECTION_10 .
2352	699	While we do n't have ASPECT_STATE_INCOME_TAX in ASPECT_WA_COIN am waiting for day when COIN get check from ASPECT_WA_GOVERNMENT , perhaps from overpayment of ASPECT_PROPERTY_TAXES , so COIN can go to ASPECT_STATE_TREASURY and ASPECT_DEMAND_PAYMENT in gold or ASPECT_SILVER in compliance with Article I ASPECT_SECTION_10 of ASPECT_US_CONSTITUTION .
2353	699	COIN ASPECT_WONDER why no ASPECT_ONE has done before ?
2354	699	Perhaps ASPECT_NON-RESPONSE_HAVE and COIN am merely unaware of ONE but ONE certainly reflects that `` legal tender ASPECT_LAWS are unconstitutional ASPECT_IMO .
2355	699	If States can only make payment in gold and ASPECT_SILVER under Constitution then ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT which is subject to rule of States can not do that which States can not do .
2356	699	States can not authorize that which NON-RESPONSE are prohibited from doing .
2357	700	Constitutions , at least in America and ASPECT_CANADA , seem to be documents are flaunted rather than followed .
2358	700	More so with America because of ASPECT_AMERICANS ' ASPECT_OBSESSION with ASPECT_AMERICAN_FOUNDERS and constitution , yet of FOUNDERS would vote\/endorse politician breaks constitution .
2359	700	One of politicians , more explicitly , being ASPECT_MIKE_HUCKABEE for example .
2360	700	It is ASPECT_HUGE_SHAME Americans do n't take constitution as legal ASPECT_DOCUMENT , but as ASPECT_POLITICAL_holy ASPECT_PAPER .
2361	701	First of , you did n't answer my ASPECT_QUESTIONS , mainly :
2362	702	ASPECT_BLUE_DOG_DEMOCRAT side with Republicans are are more interested in keeping jobs in conservative infested ASPECT_STATES , than what is good for country , and are in minority , just like ASPECT_REPS._CALLING_OBAMA_SOCIALIST is phrase coined by Bush ASPECT_LIMBAUGH , repeated by ASPECT_GOP_MEDIA , Fox ASPECT_NEWS_and ASPECT_COMPANY , and conservatives who have no ASPECT_EARTHLY_IDEA what true ASPECT_SOCIALISM is , but find SIDE comforting to make assumption about Obama , because way do n't have to expose true ASPECT_REASONS , prejudice ASPECT_AD_BIGOTRY .
2363	702	Socialists claim calling Obama socialist is ABSURDObama not ASPECT_SOCIALIST , I should knowObama ASPECT_TAX_POLICY not Socialist
2364	703	ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH calls socialist and ASPECT_COMMUNISTS_evil ASPECT_PEOPLE and PEOPLE want to destroy `` country , yet whenever LIMBAUGH defines socialism and communism it 's always psuedo-Stalinism .
2365	703	ASPECT_GLENN_BECK , on hand , is completely insane .
2366	703	BECK believes progressives are evil ASPECT_KIND of people in world , and BECK thinks ASPECT_WOODROW_WILSON , progressive , created eugenic ASPECT_CAMPS .
2367	703	truth is , believe Sparta was to do so .
2368	705	's because Reagan was President .
2369	705	Obama is but talking ASPECT_HEAD , ASPECT_EMPTY_SUIT .
2370	706	ASPECT_IMPLYING_REAGAN -LRB- surprised ASPECT_NOBODY can actually spell ASPECT_REAGAN_NAME -RRB- was else either .
2371	707	I am usually very conscientious with spelling but let that one ASPECT_SLIP by .
2372	707	SLIP is corrected .
2373	707	Reagan was far superior to Obama , and compare Obama to Reagan are very insulting to Reagan .
2374	708	While Obama is anything but competent , I can say about Reagan .
2375	708	's just I , though .
2376	710	It 's actually easy to answer , at least if you are not democrat or ASPECT_LIBERAL-LEANING_INDEPENDENT .
2377	710	odds of Obama adopting conservative or `` ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PLATFORM during couple of years is extremely remote .
2378	710	If you are ASPECT_POLAR_OPPOSITE of majority of ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICIES_TODAY , BET fair ASPECT_BET you 're going to ASPECT_POLAR_OPPOSITES of majority of ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICIES come ASPECT_ELECTION_TIME .
2379	711	He has already adopted much of `` ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PLATFORM .
2380	711	Most notably on foreign ASPECT_POLICY_ISSUES .
2381	711	Where HE has changed way ASPECT_PRESIDENT_TALKS , but has done very little to change way president acts .
2382	711	HE has also failed to pass meaningful financial ASPECT_REFORM , and appointed ASPECT_TIMOTHY_GEITHNER , man who played major ASPECT_ROLE in Bush ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION , as BUSH ASPECT_TREASURY_SECRETARY .
2383	711	HE has obviously deviated on issues as well , but narrative right ASPECT_WING_fantasy ASPECT_STORY_TELLERS -LRB- aka fox ASPECT_NEWS and ASPECT_AM_RADIO -RRB- have been propagating , about Obama radical ASPECT_AGENDA is completely detached from reality .
2384	711	There is than enough there for rational and ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_MINDED_CONSERVATIVE to like .
2385	711	TELLERS may not like things , specifically ASPECT_INCREASED_SPENDING -LRB- though ASPECT_NARRATIVE did n't bother TELLERS under Bush ASPECT_-RRB- , but there are issues on which TELLERS could come to agreement .
2386	711	SPENDING just happens that Obama sparks irrational ASPECT_HATRED among people on right , and causes PEOPLE to invent reasons to hate OBAMA more than reality could ever dictate .
2387	712	You think Obama is different than Bush ?
2389	713	I agree that he 's similar to Bush , particularly in foreign ASPECT_AFFAIRS .
2390	713	As for rest , REST extremely debatable .
2391	713	Bush might have been ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_, ASPECT_BUT would seriously call BUSH ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE .
2392	713	Stating that BUSH adopted ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PLATFORM is stretch of ASPECT_ENORMOUS_PROPORTIONS .
2393	713	Not being able to carry out BUSH original ASPECT_PROMISES does n't ASPECT_EQUAL_ADOPTION of ASPECT_OPPOSITE_STANCE .
2394	713	ASPECT_NEW_PRESIDENTS fail miserable when ADOPTION comes to delivering on ASPECT_PRESIDENTS_CAMPAIGN promises .
2395	713	You seem to have pretty strong ASPECT_FEELINGS there , frodly .
2396	713	Maybe conservatives are n't ones with irrational ASPECT_HATRED .
2397	713	Just because does n't agree with Obama does n't mean he 's being called radical .
2398	713	You seem to be under impression that hatred for opposing ASPECT_TEAM in new ; IMPRESSION not .
2399	713	democrats were absolutely rabid towards Bush .
2400	714	I dislike Obama as much as bush .
2401	714	I simply reject conservative ASPECT_POSITION being taken of late , that Obama is worst evil ASPECT_POLITICIAN in world , when reality is , OBAMA is just like pretty ASPECT_POLITICIANS .
2402	714	I should say OBAMA is like ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_POLITICIANS , which means lacking in true ASPECT_PRINCIPLES and loyal to interests ASPECT_FUND_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN_and ASPECT_LOBBY_OBAMA on daily ASPECT_BASIS .
2403	715	Bush was much worse then Obama , but that still does not make ASPECT_OBAMA_good ASPECT_ENOUGH for me to vote for OBAMA .
2404	717	Obviously Americans also ASPECT_CONSIDERED ASPECT_MCCAIN\/PALIN_WORSE than Obama and did vote for Obama which is why OBAMA was elected .
2405	717	2012 ASPECT_ELECTIONS will probably hinge on ASPECT_FUNDAMENTAL_DECISION .
2406	717	ASPECT_OBAMA_maybe ASPECT_BAD but is OBAMA worse than who Republicans will run against OBAMA .
2407	717	On ASPECT_SIDE_NOTE if we compared ASPECT_MCCAIN_and ASPECT_PALIN I would state that McCain was superior to Palin -LRB- even though MCCAIN is dinosaur of politics -RRB- and ASPECT_PALIN_CHOICE obviously hurt McCain in election .
2408	717	Republicans would certainly reflect absolute ASPECT_STUPIDITY to run worst ASPECT_PART of 2008 ASPECT_TICKET as 2012 ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE .
2409	717	Hopefully will actually nominate good ASPECT_CANDIDATE but PART is doubtful based upon ASPECT_PAST_HISTORY .
2410	719	One of problems we have is that elections are not carried by voting for candidates so much as voting against candidates .
2411	719	I believe Obama was elected with support of independents who were fundamentally voting against ASPECT_MCCAIN\/PALIN_TICKET .
2412	719	SUPPORT was choice between `` two ASPECT_EVILS and independents selected lessor of two ASPECT_EVILS .
2413	719	Americans will probably be faced with choice in 2012 .
2414	721	I do n't think so , but you are entitled to your ASPECT_OPINION .
2415	721	Obama has done damage in ASPECT_1_1\/2 ASPECT_YEARS than Bush did in 8 .
2416	722	Let see , economy was imperiled by Bush ASPECT_ADMINSTRATION lack of attention and ASPECT_NEGLECT of ASPECT_UNITED_States ASPECT_WHILE off waging ASPECT_WARS based upon unsupported and often false ASPECT_ALLEGATIONS which resulted in as as one million innocent ASPECT_PEOPLE dying while also leaving government with over trillion ASPECT_DOLLAR_budgetary ASPECT_DEFICIT in 2009 and having doubled ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT in 8 ASPECT_YEARS .
2417	722	FAN 'm not fan of Obama but OBAMA is going to have to do quite bit ASPECT_EQUAL_DAMAGE done to ASPECT_UNITED_STATES by ASPECT_PRIOR_ADMINSTRATION .
2418	723	I really ca n't see how he 's as Bush .
2419	723	HE 's working to get DADT repealed .
2420	723	HE passed major ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL Bush would have never touched .
2421	723	And HE completely reformed healthcare in way Bush never would have done .
2422	723	Not to mention HE has sensible ASPECT_TAX_PLAN and HE policies are actually improving economy rather than destroying ECONOMY .
2423	723	HE 's not perfect .
2424	723	But HE 's leagues above Bush .
2425	726	Besides for throw in about ASPECT_GLOBALISTS -LRB- is small anyways -RRB- , HE agree with almost your ASPECT_POST .
2426	726	HE also voted for Obama , and HE now regret NOW and will never vote for Obama , or Democrat of kind for matter , ever again .
2427	726	You are right .
2428	726	HE was too young to remember Clinton .
2429	726	HE became politically aware under Bush , and HE knew was that Bush was really terrible ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
2430	726	HE figured that if we got Bush out , IMPROVEMENT would be major ASPECT_IMPROVEMENT , and HE really had ASPECT_HIGH_EXPECTATIONS for Obama .
2431	726	Instead BUSH passed mandate required people to give money to ASPECT_PRIVATE_HEALTH_CARE_COMPANIES .
2432	726	BUSH has failed to stop rendition , close Guantanamo , ASPECT_STOP_TORTURE , get WE out of Iraq , ASPECT_OPEN_TALKS with Iran , etc. .
2433	726	HE do n't necessarily agree with of issues -LRB- ASPECT_GUANTANAMO for example is just ASPECT_POLITICAL_FOOTBALL , even if WE closed ASPECT_RENDITION_WE just would have moved people somewhere else without actually changing anything ASPECT_SUBSTANTIAL_-RRB- , but if BUSH had lived up to promises ASPECT_RENDITION would show HE that BUSH is not just ASPECT_POLITICIAN .
2434	726	He of course has not .
2435	726	HE now realize is NOW is ASPECT_POLITICAL_THEATER .
2436	726	There is no right ASPECT_WING or ASPECT_LEFT_WING_MEDIA , there is corporate ASPECT_MEDIA .
2437	726	NBC , Fox , CNN , and ASPECT_NEWS_NETWORKS receive revenues from ASPECT_ADVERTISING_DOLLARS from corporations .
2438	726	CNN is interests of corporations media represents , not ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_VIEWPOINT .
2439	726	CORPORATIONS simply need to have fox ASPECT_NEWS_distract right ASPECT_WINGERS from legitimate ASPECT_ISSUES facing country , and ASPECT_MEDIA_SOURCES to distract people from legitimate ASPECT_PROBLEMS facing country .
2440	726	As you said , who thinks there is major ASPECT_DIFFERENCE between Democrats and ASPECT_REPUBLICANS in action is twit .
2441	726	There ASPECT_RHETORIC may be radically different , but when was time conservative ASPECT_BALANCED budget and when was time liberal passed significant ASPECT_PIECE of ASPECT_SOCIAL_welfare ASPECT_LEGISLATION was not just giant ASPECT_HANDOUT to ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PROVIDERS ?
2442	726	Bush and ASPECT_REAGAN spent like drunk ASPECT_SAILORS , and Clinton gutted welfare .
2443	726	SAILORS do n't actually live up to rhetoric SAILORS spout .
2444	726	It is simply ASPECT_WAY to keep normal ASPECT_PEOPLE of country occupied .
2445	726	So PEOPLE make up fake ASPECT_ISSUES like Obama is socialist ASPECT_, or look at how ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN spent on shoes , or ASPECT_MICHAEL_JACKSON died -LRB- even better -RRB- , or element of ASPECT_POLITICAL_or ASPECT_POP_CULTURE_CIRCUS to distract us from ASPECT_POLITICAL_REALITIES currently facing country .
2446	728	video is put together by schizophrenic lunatic , ASPECT_AND who takes EMBARRASSMENT seriously is embarrassment to human ASPECT_RACE .
2447	728	With legitimate ASPECT_CRITICISMS can be made of politician , ASPECT_BARRACK_OBAMA very much included , why are right ASPECT_WINGERS obsessed with insane ASPECT_AND off ASPECT_WALL_CRITICISMS .
2448	728	OBAMA was actually born in Kenya !!
2449	728	OBAMA is ASPECT_MARXIST_!!
2450	728	OBAMA never actually went to college .
2451	728	And on and on .
2452	728	I see stuff , and can not imagine how human ASPECT_BEING could take BEING seriously , and ASPECT_HEIGHT_WORRIES I to no ASPECT_END , to know that people do in fact take HEIGHT seriously .
2453	728	HEIGHT is height of irrationality .
2454	728	I try to give people benefit of doubt as ASPECT_AS is possible , but many of right ASPECT_WINGERS on forum make FORUM very difficult .
2455	729	Say what you want .
2456	729	I do n't trust guy .
2457	729	History will show GUY is fraud .
2458	730	I do n't trust AGENT either !!
2459	730	does n't mean I think AGENT is actually ASPECT_MUSLIM_MARXIST_DOUBLE_AGENT from Kenya !!
2460	732	Obama is one of conservative ASPECT_DEMOCRATS to run in awhile .
2461	732	On global ASPECT_STANDARD_OBAMA ASPECT_CENTER_RIGHT .
2462	732	of major ASPECT_ACCOMPLISHMENTS have been too conservative for on left .
2463	733	You are out of your ASPECT_MIND_MAN .
2464	733	Name one ASPECT_PRESIDENT who passed -LRB- borrowed from chinese -RRB- 800 BILLION ASPECT_DOLLAR_`` ASPECT_STIMULUS and passed 4 ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLAR_HEALTHCARE_welfare ASPECT_PLAN for fat lazy poor ASPECT_PEOPLE to get free ASPECT_DRUGS .
2465	733	Osama is by far ASPECT_EXTREME_LEFTY to ever step foot in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE .
2466	733	And look what happens .
2467	733	.10 unemployment and 6 million lost ASPECT_JOBS
2468	734	Just because he has n't come through on ASPECT_VARIOUS_THINGS promised does n't necessarily mean HE leans less to left than previouslythought .
2469	734	It just means that HE has failed to accomplish what was promised .
2470	735	Yeah , you 're right , Bush only spent 700 ASPECT_BILLION in BUSH ASPECT_DAYS and spent 11 ASPECT_TRILLION largely on war of choice in Iraq .
2471	736	Bush passed 1.8 trillion ASPECT_DOLLAR_STIMULUS comprised completely of corporate ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
2472	736	also BUSH 600 ASPECT_DOLLAR_TAX_REBATE_STIMULUS_COST about 150 ASPECT_BILLION .
2473	736	Reagan ASPECT_TAX_CUTS cost us even than Bush as percentage of US GDP .
2474	737	war for 7 ASPECT_YEARS while Bush was in office was 600 Billion ASPECT_DOLLARS , for 7 ASPECT_YEARS of war .
2475	737	Where in hell are you getting 11 ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS_BRAH ?
2476	740	You know , thats good ASPECT_QUESTION .
2477	740	I do believe I heard QUESTION but now I 'm not sure .
2478	740	I 'll cop to .
2479	740	I withdraw figure and apologize .
2480	740	Seriously , I apologize .
2481	741	Get on bandwagon my ASPECT_FRIEND !!
2482	741	MY will either not vote , or vote for ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_LIBERAL .
2483	741	MY would vote for nader , but MY do n't think LIBERAL will run again .
2484	741	Hopefully one takes LIBERAL ASPECT_PLACE , and MY will vote for them .
2485	742	I 'll end up voting for 'll get like 0.3 of vote , but at least I 'll feel better .
2486	742	God knows I 'm not voting Republican .
2487	743	Yep here .
2488	743	I will vote for one who gets almost no ASPECT_VOTES , but I will feel better than voting for Obama or Democrat , and I would never vote for Republican either .
2489	744	Reagan ASPECT_TAX_CUTS did no .
2490	744	was spending increases on thepart of democrat controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS .
2491	745	How will assisting in your ASPECT_SIDES_LOSS make you feel better ?
2492	746	If Obama runs again , I think OBAMA will win .
2493	746	But independent of , why should I vote for anybody for reason than because I agree with them ?
2494	747	Obama has n't really changed ASPECT_OBAMA_PHILOSOPHICAL_STANCE on issues , what 's `` not to agree with ?
2495	748	I would have voted for him in 2008 if I was old enough to .
2496	748	HIM ran to left of where HIM been during ASPECT_HIM_TIME in office .
2497	748	I do n't think 's debatable .
2498	749	I most certainly is debatable , Just because he has failed to come through on ASPECT_CERTAINCAMPAIGN_PROMISES does n't mean HE 's changed HE philisophicalstances .
2499	749	It simply means HE failed to come through as promised .
2500	750	It 's not that SOCIALIST has n't come through , IT 's how SOCIALIST goes about not coming through , SOCIALIST ASPECT_DIG ?
2501	750	SOCIALIST too willing to compromise to ASPECT_NTH_DEGREE with party will vote against ASPECT_EVERYTHING_NTH or Democrats propose , party has significant ASPECT_PORTION believes SOCIALIST is Socialist and\/or SOCIALIST not even citizen of country .
2502	751	Obama will receive your ASPECT_VOTE again .
2503	751	When election finally gets here you 'll realize even more just how important your ASPECT_VOTE is , and will not want to waste VOTE on ASPECT_NOBODY_CANDIDATE .
2504	751	You will then hold your ASPECT_NOSEAND hit switch for Obama once again .
2505	752	Would n't it be good to see him push for ASPECT_HIM_POLICIES even when HIM does n't have votes at time when bill is introduced ?
2506	752	I totally agree with your ASPECT_POST on HIM being pragmatic .
2507	752	However , there is time to go with crowd and there is time to lead .
2508	752	I have n't seen ASPECT_HIM_LEAD much .
2510	753	He could care less what republicans want .
2511	753	What happened with ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE should be plentyevidence of .
2512	754	They threw in bunch of amendments I do recall .
2513	755	amendments mean little to in ASPECT_OVERALL_SCHEME of things .
2514	755	What 's important is that none of republicans voted for it .
2515	756	They were n't going to vote for it no matter what he proposed .
2516	757	I guarantee you that I wo n't .
2517	758	No , it means NO ASPECT_RHETORIC does not match NO ASPECT_ACTION .
2518	758	I do n't care what Obama says OBAMA believes , I do n't care what ASPECT_OBAMA_PHILOSOPHICAL_STANCES are , I care what ASPECT_OBAMA_ACTIONS are .
2519	758	ASPECT_OBAMA_ACTIONS are unacceptable .
2520	758	For I to forgive actions because I agree with of things OBAMA says would be very stupid .
2521	759	No ASPECT_WHAT is important is that there was no ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION , and there was mandate .
2522	759	mandate is basically giant ASPECT_HANDOUT to ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PROVIDERS .
2523	759	There has also been no significant financial ASPECT_REFORM .
2524	759	No further ASPECT_ENVIRONMENTAL_REFORM .
2525	759	No comprehensive progressive ASPECT_ENERGY_BILL .
2526	759	Republicans voted against COMPREHENSIVE as ASPECT_POLITICAL_THEATER .
2527	759	They spent ASPECT_YEAR_CONVINCING THEY followers that obama was evil ASPECT_SOCIALIST , and that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM was example of evil ASPECT_SOCIALISM .
2528	759	YEAR would have been impossible for THEY to have then voted for bill .
2529	759	YEAR also perpetuates myth that there is ASPECT_FUNDAMENTAL_DIFFERENCE between 2 ASPECT_PARTIES .
2530	759	Both ASPECT_PARTIES are controlled by special and corporate ASPECT_INTERESTS , and persuaded by lobbyists on daily ASPECT_BASIS .
2531	759	SPECIAL is interests of groups both ASPECT_PARTIES represent , not ASPECT_OVERARCHING_IDEOLOGY .
2532	759	Why would I vote for one ASPECT_PARTY over , when outcomes on important ASPECT_ISSUE are going to be pretty much .
2533	760	Even if were true , so what ?
2534	760	democrats managed to win super ASPECT_MAJORITY and republicans did n't `` and still do n't have power to stop anything .
2535	761	They do n't have to as as Democrats ' ASPECT_MAJORITY does that for THEY .
2536	761	All GOP has to do is vote no. .
2537	762	What ever direction ASPECT_GOP_VOTES right now is irrelevant .
2538	762	They simply do n't have numbers to stop democrats .
2539	763	Democrats stop Democrats .
2540	763	's point .
2541	764	You 're kind of missing point , ASPECT_POINT_BEING said that his recent ASPECT_ACTIONS -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- is proof that HIS has of sudden ASPECT_SHIFTED right philosophically .
2542	764	I believe when KIND comes to HIS ASPECT_IDEOLOGY HIS is as liberal as HIS ASPECT_EVER was .
2543	765	If process gets stopped up with of democratscurrently in office then you need to focus on what ASPECT_WRONG with THEN , not republicans .
2544	766	I am .
2545	766	's been focus of I posts in thread .
2546	766	Btw , FOCUS looks like you 're posting in Blank ASPECT_VERSE_LOL .
2547	767	What are you saying ??
2548	767	supports my ASPECT_POSITION , POSITION does not weaken POSITION .
2549	767	Democrats had super ASPECT_MAJORITY for almost ASPECT_YEAR .
2550	767	They could have gotten ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION , financial ASPECT_REFORM , reformed ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY in liberal ASPECT_FASHION , improved welfare ASPECT_STATE , etc. .
2551	767	What did THEY do instead ?
2552	767	THEY got almost done in year , and then blamed Republicans for stopping THEY , when as you pointed out , Republicans had no ASPECT_MEANS by which to stop THEY .
2553	767	So THEY are full of -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- ASPECT_-RRB- -LRB- -RRB- .
2554	767	Why would MY vote for THEY ?
2555	768	is because your ASPECT_BELIEF is clearly based on irrational ASPECT_PARTISANSHIP .
2556	768	If you instead based your ASPECT_BELIEFS on reality , your ASPECT_BELIEFS would quickly change .
2557	770	Does mean yes then ?
2558	770	Or is MEAN as no , which would then make me think you could just use ASPECT_NO_OPTION available ...
2559	771	I give you props for .
2561	772	I also vote for .
2562	773	Remember , is what ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_LEADER , ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH , wants .
2563	773	Limbaugh wants ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA to fail , as do of republicans .
2564	773	do n't care if hurts America , as long as Rush is happy !
2565	774	interestingthere are estimated 20 million ASPECT_PEOPLE who listen to Limbaugh .
2566	774	I do n't know if is ASPECT_OCCASIONAL_LISTENERS or type of solid ASPECT_DAILY .
2567	774	There are approx 55 million ASPECT_REGISTERED_REPUBLICANS .
2568	774	We will leave out IndependentsSo , you assume to know what ASPECT_LIMBAUGH thinks .
2569	774	INDEPENDENTSSO has been clear that INDEPENDENTSSO wants country to succeed .
2570	774	You also assume that 20 million ASPECT_LISTENERS will do exactly as they are told by LimbaughWhat then becomes of 35 ASPECT_MILLION who do n't listen ?
2571	774	do you have talking ASPECT_POINTS ?
2572	774	I have good ASPECT_SITE you may likewww.mybarackobama.com
2573	775	If you do n't believe Limbaugh is ASPECT_GOP_LEADER , just ask LIMBAUGH !
2574	777	Your ASPECT_RIGHT he would be dead .
2575	778	You have his ASPECT_PHONE ?
2576	778	seems anti ASPECT_AMERICAN_LEFTIST are ones actually listen to LEFTIST , I know of no ASPECT_ONE does .
2577	779	Ridicules ASPECT_SPECULATION , no ASPECT_PROOF .
2579	781	Thank you , have n't seen or listened to him since HIM had ASPECT_EVENING_TV_SHOW ... .
2581	781	probably going on 20 or so years ?
2582	783	Very astute ASPECT_POINT .
2583	783	If guy ca n't pick dog with alacrity , GUY has no ASPECT_BUSINESS being president .
2584	785	How did it take for him to decide to accept help to plug -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_-LRB- -RRB- ed ASPECT_HOLE ?
2585	785	is destroying ASPECT_PEOPLES_LIVES_and ASPECT_JOBS .
2586	786	does n't take ASPECT_ROCKET_SCIENTIST to figure out when `` says I want Obama to fail , is as saying `` SCIENTIST want country to fall .
2587	786	Obama failure would only be seen\/recognized if country was in toilet , as was seen when Bush was in office .
2588	786	Fortunately , FAILURE was near end of ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM and Americans had sense enough not to vote in ASPECT_OBAMA_CLONE with ASPECT_OBAMA_AIRHEAD_COHORT .
2589	787	day , I believe .
2590	788	Are you sure ?
2591	788	Because we heard on Faux ASPECT_NEWS that NEWS took him month !
2592	788	-LRB- Just kidding -RRB- .
2593	788	But , FACT is fact , Faux ASPECT_NEWS_COMMENTATORS are still claiming that no foreign ASPECT_SHIPS have been allowed to help , but is not true .
2594	788	As usual , Fox ASPECT_NEWS spreads lies before doing ASPECT_FACT_CHECKING .
2595	788	administration says foreign ASPECT_VESSELS are already helping to combat worst ASPECT_U.S._OIL_SPILL so blanket ASPECT_WAIVER isn needed .
2596	788	There are lot of foreign ASPECT_VESSELS operating offshore , ASPECT_COAST_GUARD_ADMIRAL_THAD_ALLEN , government s ASPECT_INCIDENT_COMMANDER , told reporters on ASPECT_JUNE_25 .
2597	788	ASPECT_COAST_GUARD would be happy to aid in requests for waivers , but to date , since REPORTERS re operating outside 3 ASPECT_MILES , no ASPECT_JONES_ACT_WAIVER has been required .
2599	789	Come on now ASPECT_KENYAN_NAVY does n't count .
2600	791	YouTube - ASPECT_JAMES_CARVILLE vs. ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH You really need to listen to , Rush explains ASPECT_CARVILLE_STANCE perfectly .
2601	791	I want Obama to fail as well .
2602	791	MINUTES 3 ASPECT_MINUTES , please listen , 3 gives perfect ASPECT_EXAMPLE .
2603	792	's right .
2604	792	do n't like Obama policies so want economy to fail because will help OBAMA be defeated .
2605	792	If ASPECT_COUPLE_million ASPECT_AMERICANS lose jobs , savings , and homes , 's OK as long as MILLION leads to ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_VICTORY .
2606	792	We see attitude from of conservatives .
2607	792	Very patriotic .
2608	793	Did you even watch video ?
2609	793	I do n't want country to turn socialist , ASPECT_OBAMA_SUCCEEDING means .
2610	793	Why would I want ?
2611	793	's not America .
2612	793	I do n't care if you think I 'm patriotic or not , I 'm way of ASPECT_AMERICAN_THAN you will ever be .
2614	794	If economy grows and is successful , then Obama succeeds .
2615	794	Which ASPECT_RUSH_and ASPECT_OBAMA_ACOLYTES are against -LRB- because OBAMA might raise ASPECT_ACOLYTES_TAXES and OBAMA 'd have to buy smaller ASPECT_MANSION_-RRB- .
2616	794	Thus OBAMA wants economy to fail , even if ASPECT_MILLIONS_AMERICANS lose ASPECT_MILLIONS_JOBS and homes , because then Obama fails .
2617	794	Which is why Rush and ASPECT_MURDOCH_MOUTHPIECES constantly emphaisize negative about economy and ignore positives .
2618	794	MILLIONS know that if MILLIONS can help create less ASPECT_CONFIDENCE in economy , will help drag M.O. down .
2619	794	has been M.O. since ASPECT_DAY_1 .
2620	794	Very patriotic .
2621	795	Ah , racism .
2622	795	ASPECT_GOTTA_love ASPECT_GOTTA .
2623	796	He was n't talking about economy .
2624	796	economy is going to fail under Obama regardless because OBAMA has no ASPECT_IDEA what OBAMA is doing .
2625	796	ECONOMY 's about socialism\/communism .
2626	796	We do n't want government having control and telling WE what to do !
2627	796	WE would rather see higher ASPECT_TAX_RATES than .
2628	796	WE want ASPECT_WE_FREEDOMS in great ASPECT_CAPITALISTIC_SOCIETY .
2629	796	American who wants government controlling things in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR is just wrong and completely un-american .
2630	798	Turn on Rush on given ASPECT_DAY and he is constantly talking about how badly economy is doing .
2631	798	IMO , if you feel way , patriotic and ASPECT_AMERICAN to do would be to try to elect representatives who share your ASPECT_VIEW and you can repeal ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and deprive tens of millions of Americans of ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_coverage and ASPECT_EVERYTHING will be ASPECT_HUNKY_DORY for you again like CARE was .
2632	798	But hoping economy goes to -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- can so ASPECT_OBAMA fails while millions lose ASPECT_MILLIONS_JOBS and homes is not .
2633	798	In my ASPECT_OPINION .
2634	799	Will I take who calls ASPECT_OBAMA_`` ASPECT_HUSSIEN seriously ???
2636	800	Nah , it was trap to see who would drag out racism ASPECT_TAG ... congratulations you won .
2637	801	It is obvious that you are so into Rush that you fail to see what he says to mean than what HE tries to explain that it means .
2638	801	country is not ASPECT_FOOTBALL_TEAM competing to win game .
2639	801	If Obama fails , means ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICIES have put country in jeopardy .
2640	801	country loses .
2641	801	Your conservative ASPECT_POLICIES did just to country , and came pretty darn ASPECT_CLOSE to failing .
2642	801	Why is so hard for conservatives to understand ?
2643	801	There is no ASPECT_FAILURE for Obama without ASPECT_COUNTRY_FAILING .
2644	801	Sorry , I 'm not comatose , I know exactly what ASPECT_RUSH meant , no ASPECT_MATTER how RUSH tries to ASPECT_SUGAR_COAT_MATTER .
2645	801	man is idiot .
2646	802	Ah , so by making racist ASPECT_COMMENT , you then catch racists ?
2647	802	Conservative ASPECT_LOGIC ?
2648	803	Actually Obama is idiot .
2649	803	OBAMA does opposite of what public wants on topic .
2650	803	Rush ca n't harm country , Obama can and OBAMA is .
2651	806	Yeah , I see higher ASPECT_EARNING_CAPACITY for ASPECT_AMERICANS_and ASPECT_FREEDOMS with Obama ASPECT_EVER-INCREASING_BUREAUCRACY .
2652	807	world ASPECT_PARIAH ?
2653	807	Since when has ASPECT_UNITED_States been ASPECT_ANYTHING but powerful ASPECT_POLITICAL_FORCE on planet ?
2654	807	And `` laughing ASPECT_STOCK ?
2655	807	Maybe you care what elitist ASPECT_EUROPEAN_SNOBS think about country but I sure as hell do n't .
2656	807	SNOBS can kiss I big fat ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUTT .
2657	807	outlandish ASPECT_HYPERBOLE .
2658	807	Under Reagan , economy boomed and millions of ASPECT_NEW_JOBS were created , and what ASPECT_CIVIL_RIGHTS were eroded during ASPECT_REAGAN_TERM , specifically ?
2659	807	And I guess you forgot who bailed out rich ASPECT_BANKERS and received ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_CONTRIBUTIONS from ASPECT_GOLDMAN_SACHS .
2660	807	would be Obama .
2661	807	P.S. - I noticed your ASPECT_VOTE has to do with how good ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA has been or would be .
2662	807	ASPECT_SPEAKS_VOLUMES ...
2663	811	Not really .
2664	811	liberals are getting fed up with Obama and you should to .
2665	811	Also , right ASPECT_CARES more about politics than average ASPECT_LEFTIST .
2666	812	And you 're basing on ?
2668	813	Even if I 'm not all that pleased with Obama , I 'll still vote for OBAMA over ASPECT_UNNAMED_REPUBLICAN .
2669	814	Obviously we disagree .
2670	814	Do HIS ASPECT_REMEMBER during Reagan second ASPECT_TERM when his ASPECT_ALZHEIMERS became so severe announcement was made that Reagen was efficient ASPECT_LEADER_REAGEN only worked 40 ASPECT_HOURS week ?
2671	814	Read between lines .
2672	814	Did you ever hear ASPECT_MAGGIE_THATCHER quote about Reagan ?
2673	814	`` THATCHER 's dear but there is absolutely between ASPECT_THATCHER_EARS .
2674	816	I doubt 's true .
2675	816	I see ASPECT_LIBERALS_and ASPECT_LIBERTARIANS saying LIBERALS would n't vote for him .
2676	816	It does n't mean conservatives outnumber left by 2 to 1 .
2677	817	liberals claiming republicans outnumber democrats 2:1 on board ...
2678	818	pelosi , ASPECT_REID_, boxer , frank , ASPECT_DODD_, ASPECT_WIGGINS_, ASPECT_RANGLE_and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PERSONAL_FAVORITE , lunatic that thinks Guam is going to tip over .
2679	818	If of liberal ASPECT_PEOPLE in ASPECT_WIGGINS_DISTRICTS did least ASPECT_BIT of research , PEOPLE would never have been voted in than once .
2680	818	So PEOPLE either do n't care , do n't pay attention , or PEOPLE do care and are just stupid .
2681	818	And for record , REPUBLICAN am not republican .
2682	818	REPUBLICAN am of opinion that politicians are crooks .
2683	818	Politicians are like diapers , POLITICIANS need to be changed often and for reason .
2684	820	No ASPECT_LIBERALISM is liberalism at LIBERALISM finest to not recognize joke and want to call NO ASPECT_RACISM .
2685	820	So congratulations to you for your ASPECT_JUMP on bandwagon of ASPECT_NAME_CALLING .
2686	821	So , in words , terrible ASPECT_SOURCE .
2687	821	goes for Republicans get re-elected for eternity .
2688	821	Incumbency is very high , no ASPECT_MATTER party .
2689	821	To make statement based on happens on both ASPECT_SIDES just does n't work .
2690	822	You do n't need them .
2691	822	ASPECT_MR._PRESIDENT is showing world ASPECT_PRESIDENT_`` amazing ASPECT_ABILITY just ASPECT_FINE without THEM .
2692	822	great ASPECT_JOB_PRESIDENT doing should have PRESIDENT re-elected in no ASPECT_TIME flat !
2693	822	BTW , I voted for McCain .
2694	823	Actually I agree with you .
2695	823	liberals are always terrible ASPECT_SOURCE .
2696	824	Forums in general are terrible ASPECT_SOURCES .
2697	824	Because then we have posters using `` sources like to make broad ASPECT_PROCLOMATION .
2698	825	Well I was using liberals own words to prove I point .
2699	825	We care because WE form things like tea-party .
2700	825	WE speak out and WE do n't let government tell WE what to do .
2701	826	I 'll say .
2702	826	FWIW , ASPECT_AMERICAN_RIGHT is more consolidated and focused than Left , and thus we have groups like ASPECT_TEA_PARTY .
2703	826	But does RIGHT mean ASPECT_GROUPS know or care ?
2704	826	Not necessarily .
2705	827	Actually it 's showing that people are becoming smarter .
2706	827	I do n't know how anybody could possibly vote for Obama .
2707	827	OBAMA full of -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- .
2708	827	OBAMA lies .
2709	827	Does n't care what people want .
2710	827	OBAMA destined to drive country straight into ground .
2711	827	candidate we put out there will be better ASPECT_CANDIDATE than Obama .
2712	828	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , ASPECT_RON_PAUL ... was easy .
2713	829	Wake up .
2714	829	Obama approval ASPECT_RATING are in free fall ASPECT_MODE right now .
2715	829	OBAMA has n't done anything positive since OBAMA was in office .
2716	829	we do is spend , spend , and spend , which equates to waste , waste , and waste .
2717	829	Obama will not be re-elected in 2012 , 2012 's just ASPECT_SIMPLE .
2718	830	Not like we do n't have over 2 ASPECT_YEARS left until election .
2719	830	Hardly had even heard about ASPECT_OBAMA_2 ASPECT_YEARS before November of 2008 .
2720	831	I believe liberals are hoping for .
2721	831	ASPECT_RON_PAUL has had plenty of chances ...
2722	832	Anybody but ASPECT_OBAMA at point .
2723	832	OBAMA 's not going to win and POINT quite evident .
2724	833	's what ASPECT_LIBERALS said about ASPECT_GW_BUSH before BUSH second ASPECT_RUN .
2725	833	`` ASPECT_ANYBODY was ASPECT_JOHN_KERRY , and KERRY simply would n't do .
2726	833	ANYBODY 'd be careful making claims this early .
2727	834	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN is joke .
2728	834	If she wins ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRIMARY -LRB- which I admit , is disturbingly possible , -RRB- then Obama win in 2012 is practically assured .
2729	834	Heck , if Palin ASPECT_OBAMA_OPPONENT , I 'll be voting for PALIN .
2730	834	ASPECT_RON_PAUL ... 's trickier .
2731	834	PAUL got good ASPECT_GRASSROOTS_MOVEMENT , and PAUL actually uses internet -LRB- as do ASPECT_PAUL_FOLLOWERS -RRB- .
2732	834	problem is , Republicans want to tank ASPECT_PAUL hard .
2733	834	fact that PAUL conservative hurts PAUL here .
2734	834	PAUL criticizes ASPECT_PAUL_PARTY as much as PAUL does Democrats -LRB- indeed , I found out today while watching ASPECT_YOUTUBE_CLIP of interview with ASPECT_RON_PAUL that PAUL expressed sentiment I express time .
2735	834	Granted INTERVIEW was old ASPECT_INTERVIEW , so PAUL probably used INTERVIEW first .
2736	834	Republicans were brought in to fix things , and INDEED just made things worse .
2737	834	So Democrats were brought in to fix things , and INDEED did just what ASPECT_INDEED said INDEED would : increase ASPECT_SPENDING_and ASPECT_TAXES . -RRB-
2738	834	But I do n't think Paul has chance .
2739	834	PAUL 'll have establishment of both ASPECT_PARTIES against PAUL .
2740	834	Not to mention media -LRB- or specifically Fox ASPECT_NEWS -RRB- hates PAUL .
2741	835	Groups that being `` focused does n't mean they are correct , evidences strong ASPECT_PROPAGANDA and absence of free ASPECT_THOUGHT .
2742	835	America ASPECT_TODAY is nowhere near as free as AMERICA used to be fifty ASPECT_YEARS ago .
2743	835	Freedom of ASPECT_THOUGHT_TODAY is criticized .
2744	835	How can you say like above , `` ASPECT_AMERICAN_RIGHT is ... ASPECT_CONSOLIDATED_AND focused ... ?
2745	835	So was ASPECT_GERMAN_RIGHT in 1934 .
2746	836	I get what you are saying .
2747	836	I really like Paul .
2748	836	I think PAUL will be able to get quite liberal ASPECT_VOTES for president if PAUL was able to win ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRIMARY .
2749	839	Obama ASPECT_2ND_TERM is guaranteed .
2750	839	Even if OBAMA does n't win , OBAMA 'll get TERM .
2751	839	See Bush 2 ASPECT_TERMS for example .
2752	839	Independents decide vote .
2753	839	No ASPECT_WAY did independents vote for Bush BUSH ASPECT_2ND_TERM .
2754	839	And no ASPECT_WAY will INDEPENDENTS vote Obama for BUSH .
2755	839	's why INDEPENDENTS can make move after move Americans do n't want and still walk with ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS_HEADS high .
2756	839	Honestly , how could we ever know that election was n't rigged in country ?
2757	839	Trust , please .
2758	840	Probably not liberals but conservative ASPECT_DEMOCRATS , conservatives alone outnumber liberals and folks in ASPECT_MIDDLE_lean conservative ASPECT_I 've noticed .
2759	841	I agree they put extremist ASPECT_BUSH in for two ASPECT_TERMS , now THEY need good ASPECT_LIBERAL for 2 ASPECT_TERMS to clean up mess left behind .
2760	842	It 's funny you , or , knows who\/what candidates will be .
2761	842	Not YOU .
2762	842	YOU will watch and see .
2763	843	LIBERAL did n't say they were correct .
2764	843	ASPECT_READ_LIBERAL ASPECT_POST again .
2765	843	LIBERAL 'm liberal .
2766	843	LIBERAL 'm telling you now that LIBERAL wo n't be voting Republican .
2767	843	LIBERAL ASPECT_GUARANTEE NOW .
2768	845	We would have saved lot of money if WE would have plugged his ASPECT_HOLE ...
2769	846	Ohhhh , about ASPECT_13 of population , , , HAHAHAHAHAAHAH .
2771	848	I do n't think so I think his ASPECT_NAME had lot to do with HIS being elected .
2772	848	ASPECT_SOUNDED_exotic and so ASPECT_FOREIGN , now ASPECT_LEROY_or ASPECT_WILLE for matter would have been just another ASPECT_NAME would n't have garnered interest .
2773	848	Barack may have problems getting people interested in BARACK , ASPECT_BARACK_NAME_or ASPECT_BARACK_POLICIES next ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_ELECTION .
2774	849	If it is necessary I will be totally shocked at gullibility of voters .
2775	851	What does even mean ?
2776	852	I do n't think there will ever be as ASPECT_GULLIBILITY as there was when Bush won second ASPECT_TIME !
2777	853	Oh come on , you can read !
2778	854	Yes , I 'm well aware of .
2779	854	I 'm just not sure of what ASPECT_POINT you 're trying to make .
2780	855	POINT was n't my ASPECT_POINT .
2781	855	Was POINT ?
2782	855	Stay on point .
2783	856	Well whoever it was .
2784	857	are so right gullibility was time Obama was elected .
2786	857	you ca n't top that even with whipped ASPECT_CREAM and cherry .
2787	858	well now you are contributing .
2788	859	You miss my ASPECT_POINT .
2789	859	MY am saying polity is managed almost beyond bounds of truly free ASPECT_CHOICE .
2790	862	Yeah dreams are to live off ass .
2791	863	Have to redistribute wealth .
2792	863	Do ASPECT_LIBERALS really want -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ???
2793	863	Do n't LIBERALS realize that road to totalitarianism is redistribution of wealth ???
2794	864	road to slavery is on end .
2795	864	Slave ASPECT_MASTERS were great ASPECT_CAPITALISTS in ASPECT_CAPITALISTS_TIME , ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHERS .
2796	865	's point of ASPECT_INCOME_TAXES .
2797	865	To distribute wealth .
2798	865	WAY 's not road to totalitarianism .
2799	865	WAY way to keep economy from being controled completely by one ASPECT_GROUP of people .
2800	865	WAY way to insure have ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS .
2801	867	So is providing and education for everyone .
2802	868	You might want to check ASPECT_CURRENT_EVENTS here : http:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/epo...oval-1044.htmlThis is polls , ASPECT_LEFT_, right , and ASPECT_CENTER .
2803	868	Currently on NO ASPECT_POLL is ASPECT_BO_GAINING and on no ASPECT_POLL is BO at 50 .
2804	868	BO ASPECT_DECLINE has been steady and consistent even by ASPECT_LEFT_leaning ASPECT_MEDIA .
2805	868	man is simply ASPECT_MIDDLE_MANAGEMENT_TYPE at best .
2806	868	MAN would NOT become executive in business .
2807	868	MAN lacks skills .
2808	869	Independents are under 40 for him according to Gallup , 's stunning for HIM .
2809	869	Do n't listen to Mertex , MERTEX stopped looking after election ... LOL ...
2811	870	ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS is redistributing to low ASPECT_CLASS .
2812	870	Obama wants no low ASPECT_CLASS .
2813	870	People are in low ASPECT_CLASS now are model ASPECT_CITIZENS in ASPECT_OBAMA_MIND .
2814	870	CITIZENS deserve people to `` give ASPECT_PEOPLE_MONEY that PEOPLE did n't earn .
2815	870	I ca n't believe you do n't see problem with redistribution of wealth .
2816	870	PROBLEM completely wrong and unethical .
2817	871	You ca n't convince of them on left , are die hard ASPECT_BELIEVERS in rising ASPECT_STAR_STATUS of Obama .
2818	871	OBAMA could drop to zero on polls and would see OBAMA at 50 or ASPECT_BETTER .
2819	874	Yeah that dirty ASPECT_COMMIE_ADAM_SMITH was for .
2820	875	ASPECT_HIGH_POINT is over .
2821	877	I guess you missed where ONE said through ASPECT_JULY_4 , ASPECT_2010 !
2822	877	was tough ASPECT_ONE .
2823	880	At point in his ASPECT_PRESIDENCY , Reagan approval ASPECT_RATING was around ASPECT_45 and falling .
2824	880	Less than half ASPECT_APPROVED of HIS ASPECT_PERFORMANCE at time .
2825	880	And HIS had had advantage of being shot .
2826	880	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/ONLINE.WSJ.COM\/PUBLIC\/RESOURC...PP0605-31.HTMLJUST_KIND of shows how unreliable ASPECT_POLLS are as predictors of ASPECT_FUTURE_EVENTS , eh ?
2827	883	You call being shot advantage ?
2828	883	Maybe 's your ASPECT_IDEA of good ASPECT_TIME , but IDEA not ASPECT_MINE and ASPECT_MR._REAGAN .
2829	884	For popularity ASPECT_PURPOSES it is .
2830	885	's very interesting .
2831	885	IMO , what you have to look at then ASPECT_IS ASPECT_FUTURE_ACTIONS .
2832	885	If Barack takes ASPECT_BARACK_CUES from Reagan , have no ASPECT_DOUBT BARACK will win reelection in landslide just like Reagan did .
2833	886	Pass big ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE in his ASPECT_3D_YEAR like Reagan did ?
2834	886	We can only hope Obama does n't follow Reagan example on deficits .
2835	886	So far OBAMA is though .
2836	887	If he had slashed ASPECT_TAX_RATES , HE could get away with small ASPECT_TAX_RATE_INCREASE .
2838	887	Exactly which `` big ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE are you referring to ?
2839	887	http:\/\/www.taxfoundation.org\/publications\/show\/151.html I love HTTP:\/\/WWW.TAXFOUNDATION.ORG\/PUBLICATIONS\/SHOW\/151.HTML when ASPECT_BARACK_SUPPORTERS talk about responsible ASPECT_SPENDING .
2841	888	Unfortunately , unlike Reagan , we do n't have luxury ASPECT_TODAY -LRB- in part because of ASPECT_REAGAN_POLICIES -RRB- of having low ASPECT_DEBT to ASPECT_GDP_RATIO where WE can afford to triple ASPECT_DEFICITS_and ASPECT_DEBT .
2842	888	ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY in 1983 , and Deficit ASPECT_REDUCTION_ACT_1984 I agree .
2843	888	I supported Clinton because she was one who was serious about issue and had best ASPECT_PLAN to address deficits .
2844	889	ME do n't care what economy is doing , it is never good ASPECT_IDEA to try to spend your ASPECT_WAY into prosperity .
2846	889	ME gave you link to ASPECT_TAX_RATES .
2847	889	ME believe you are confusing ASPECT_TAX_REVENUES with ASPECT_TAX_RATES .
2848	889	Show me where ASPECT_PERSONAL_INCOME_TAX_RATES went up .
2849	889	ME 'm not saying they did n't .
2850	889	ME just ca n't find it .
2851	889	McCain may not have been great ASPECT_CANDIDATE , but MCCAIN had far ASPECT_CREDIBILITY on ASPECT_SPENDING_ISSUE than of democrats .
2852	890	I agree .
2853	890	IDEA can be good ASPECT_IDEA to spend your ASPECT_WAY out of ASPECT_RECESSION\/DEPRESSION_CYCLE , however .
2854	890	I did n't say ASPECT_PERSONAL_INCOME_TAX_RATES went up .
2855	890	ASPECT_SS_TAX_RATES when up about ASPECT_20 , from 5 to ASPECT_6 http:\/\/www.ssa.gov\/OACT\/ProgData\/taxRates.htmlThe 1984 ASPECT_ACT was ASPECT_LANDRY_LIST of ASPECT_TAX_CODE_CHANGES .
2856	890	effects are summarized here : http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ReaganomicsThis ASPECT_LINK also notes 1982 ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE as well : http:\/\/www.capitalgainsandgames.com\/...-tax-increasesMcCain may not have been great ASPECT_CANDIDATE , but CANDIDATE had far ASPECT_CREDIBILITY on ASPECT_SPENDING_ISSUE than of democrats .
2857	890	-LRB- ASPECT_\/_QUOTE -RRB-
2859	892	So in your ASPECT_MIND , 15 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT is preferable to larger deficit and ASPECT_DEBT ?
2860	892	largest ASPECT_PROBLEM with argument , is that when you have recession or depression , you will lose amounts of ASPECT_REVENUE_ANYWAYS .
2861	892	You could say , we need to cut spending in response to decreases in revenue , but would lead to very undesirable ASPECT_ECONOMIC_OUTCOMES .
2862	892	WE could also raise taxes to make up for loss in revenue , again problem is will also lead to undesirable ASPECT_ECONOMIC_OUTCOMES .
2863	892	So how do you deal with problem ?
2864	892	answer is , ANSWER is very difficult in ASPECT_WE_CURRENT_POLITICAL_CLIMATE .
2865	892	It is n't very difficult solution either , but ASPECT_POLITICAL_POSTURING makes sane ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DECISIONS almost impossible .
2866	892	What one with knowledge of economics would say , is that you balance budget over ASPECT_BUSINESS_CYCLE , not on year to ASPECT_YEAR_BASIS .
2867	892	Which means ASPECT_SPENDING_and ASPECT_TAX_POLICY should fluctuate .
2868	892	When is recession or depression , you raise spending and cut taxes , which then stimulates economy .
2869	892	When economy is booming , you cut spending and raise taxes .
2870	892	economy can handle changes in times of prosperity , and then you make up for deficits are accrued during tough ASPECT_ECONOMIC_TIMES .
2871	892	problem is ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY is not particularly rational .
2872	892	Neither ASPECT_SIDE ever cuts spending during good ASPECT_ECONOMIC_TIMES , and Republicans oppose ASPECT_TAX_HIKES at times .
2873	892	makes conducting policy in reasonable ASPECT_WAY , meaning balancing budget over ASPECT_BUSINESS_CYCLE , almost impossible .
2874	892	Instead have Republicans who want to cut taxes , without actually enacting ASPECT_SPENDING_CUTS , while economy is strong .
2875	892	And democrats who want to raise taxes , but want to do so even when ECONOMY is economically inadvisable .
2876	892	ECONOMY is ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POSTURING , and ECONOMY is very bad for country .
2877	893	Nice ASPECT_LEAP of logic .
2878	893	I believe that Barack ASPECT_SPENDING_spree ASPECT_COST_JOBS and prevented growth .
2879	893	IMO , IMO has changed slow ASPECT_RECOVERY into stagnate ASPECT_ONE .
2880	893	Do math .
2881	894	No , I am not making leap in logic .
2882	894	I was asking you hypothetical ASPECT_QUESTION .
2883	894	I was not claiming that without increased ASPECT_SPENDING , we would have 15 ASPECT_&#37;_UNEMPLOYMENT , though I feel confident ASPECT_SPENDING would be higher .
2884	894	I am asking ASPECT_SIMPLE_hypothetical and ASPECT_PHILOSOPHICAL_QUESTION about importance of combating unemployment measured against importance of combating ASPECT_DEBT .
2885	895	question does not make sense .
2886	895	ASPECT_SPENDING_BILL hurt recovery , IMO .
2887	896	question makes perfect ASPECT_SENSE .
2888	896	Despite your ASPECT_BELIEFS , idea that ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING stimulates economy is not very controversial among economists .
2889	896	It is widely accepted to be true -LRB- though minority does exist questions that fact -RRB- .
2890	896	You may believe that stimulus did not do enough to justify STIMULUS costs , but to claim ASPECT_STIMULUS_hurt ASPECT_RECOVERY , is first of ASPECT_UNPROVABLE_, and ASPECT_SECOND of actually ASPECT_LEAP of logic on your ASPECT_PART .
2891	896	What ASPECT_EVIDENCE do you have to support your ASPECT_CLAIM that stimulus hurt recovery ?
2892	896	What ASPECT_ECONOMIC_REASONING do you have , if no ASPECT_EVIDENCE exists ?
2893	896	Simply stating you believe , without offering explanation for why belief exists , does not make sense .
2894	898	people guilty of fraud are ASPECT_BIRTHER_`` ASPECT_EXPERTS you follow .
2895	899	Yeah , Obama is guilty of is ASPECT_WAR_CRIMES , taking bribes , and violating constitutional ASPECT_RIGHTS of Americans via ASPECT_DOMESTIC_SPYING .
2896	899	God , if GONNA 're gonna hate and condemn man , at least hate and condemn GOD for legitimate ASPECT_REASONS .
2897	899	whole ASPECT_PROBLEM is there has n't been CHANGE .
2898	899	change is change in your ASPECT_POCKET amounts to your ASPECT_LIFE_SAVINGS after being robbed by capitalist ASPECT_CLASS while Obama was picking REAGAN butt and being taught by ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON how to be black ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON who ASPECT_REAGAN was ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_RONALD_REAGAN .
2899	899	change would be De-Reaganization .
2900	901	You clearly do not understand how unemployment ASPECT_RATE is determined .
2901	901	RATE has to do with collecting unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS or not .
2902	901	RATE has to do with actively seeking employment vs not seeking employment .
2903	901	There are people who do want to work , but are not seeking work , who are not in work ASPECT_FORCE , but how do you determine ?
2904	901	WORK is impossible , so basically you or one , just made up .
2905	902	Frodly , there are people who believe that unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS are ASPECT_JOB_CREATORS too .
2906	902	Do I have to prove what stupid ASPECT_IDEA is too ?
2907	902	kinds of ASPECT_GOVT_SPENDING do stimulate economy .
2908	902	I never said SPENDING could n't .
2909	902	Dollar for dollar , you ca n't beat DEFENSE ASPECT_SPENDING for ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH .
2910	902	Another ASPECT_NICE about defense ASPECT_SPENDING is that is actually authorized by Constitution .
2911	902	I have no ASPECT_LINK to prove that economy would be better off without ASPECT_PORKULUS_BILL .
2912	902	You have no ASPECT_LINK to prove that economy would be worse .
2913	902	I do n't see point in ASPECT_BUTTING_HEADS .
2914	902	POINT bizarre that you say I opinion is unprovable , but yours is `` widely accepted to be true .
2915	902	You want ASPECT_ECONOMIC_REASONING ?
2916	902	How about human ASPECT_NATURE ?
2917	902	money will have to come from somewhere , frodly .
2918	902	800,000,000,000 .
2919	902	We know where MONEY will have to come from .
2920	902	WE know that budgets get bigger , not ASPECT_SMALLER .
2921	902	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH comes from risks .
2922	902	There 's in ASPECT_PORKULUS_BILL encourages risks .
2923	902	ASPECT_SHEER_SIZE of ASPECT_BILL_DISCOURAGES_RISK .
2924	902	SIZE human ASPECT_NATURE .
2925	902	Go ahead and ignore SIZE .
2926	902	Not I .
2927	903	I have very ASPECT_SIMPLE_ECONOMIC_REASONING to support I position .
2928	903	ASPECT_CURRENT_ECONOMIC_CRISIS is not ASPECT_SUPPLY_PROBLEM , CRISIS is matter of insufficient ASPECT_DEMAND .
2929	903	ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING boosts aggregate ASPECT_DEMAND , therefore boosting economy .
2930	903	Not only , but unemployment ASPECT_INSURANCE undoubtedly stimulates economy .
2931	903	There is no ASPECT_DOUBT that INSURANCE also offers work ASPECT_DISINCENTIVE , but in ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DOWNTURNS , that disincentive is pretty irrelevant .
2932	903	People are not out of work at moment , because PEOPLE get unemployment ASPECT_INSURANCE , and therefore have no ASPECT_REASON to look for work .
2933	903	PEOPLE are out of work , because ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE_BURST , and we had ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DOWNTURN .
2934	903	Removing or reducing unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS might cause people to get ASPECT_JOBS_PEOPLE are likely overqualified for , but reality is WE would till have millions of people who can not find work !!
2935	903	What do you do with people ?
2936	903	If government gives ASPECT_PEOPLE_unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS , PEOPLE will spend money , thereby stimulating economy .
2937	903	GOVERNMENT is n't that complicated either .
2938	903	Unemployed ASPECT_PEOPLE use ASPECT_INCOME_PEOPLE receive from government , which then increases ASPECT_DEMAND_, consumption , ASPECT_ETC. .
2939	903	Which then can create jobs .
2940	903	While there is strong ASPECT_EVIDENCE to suggest it is disincentive to work , DISINCENTIVE also certainly creates jobs for others !!
2941	905	Just posting info .
2942	905	I never implied INFO to be gospel or ASPECT_FUTURE_PREDICTION .
2943	907	How did it costs jobs and prevent growth .
2944	907	If money had not been distributed in hundreds of billions in ASPECT_TAX_CUTS_and ASPECT_FUNDS for ASPECT_PROJECTS_and ASPECT_GOVERNMENTS , please explain your ASPECT_SCENARIO of how there would be ASPECT_EMPLOYMENT_and ASPECT_GROWTH .
2945	908	Are you just digging ?
2946	908	If you dispute information , ASPECT_SHOW_INFORMATION to be wrong .
2947	908	You know , offer information .
2948	908	Like show how ASPECT_BO has spent of almost ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLAR_STIMULUS and how BO has not spent .
2949	908	You know , ASPECT_MONEY_BO needed right away to stimulate economy and hold unemployment ASPECT_RATE to 8 .
2950	908	Yes to 8 , LOL .
2951	909	I did n't make claim .
2952	909	Proof that he has spend almost ASPECT_TRILLION in stimulus ?
2953	909	I do n't think PROOF is near .
2954	910	Man , , if Obama is doing impression of ASPECT_SKY_DIVER holding boulder than OBAMA is doing one ASPECT_HELL of good ASPECT_JOB ... ASPECT_LOLREMEMBER_FOLKS , is man was given ASPECT_NOBEL_peace ASPECT_PRIZE , and University has OBAMA I believe 13 on ASPECT_FOLKS_LIST of Great ASPECT_PRESIDENTS , 's one above Reagan I believe ... LOLHow you get to be in position and have well ASPECT_OVER half ASPECT_COUNTRY_DISAGREEING with your two largest ASPECT_AGENDAS -LRB- ASPECT_HEALTH_and ASPECT_IMMIGRATION -RRB- I have no ASPECT_IDEA .
2955	910	Then again we still do not know why OBAMA received ASPECT_NOBEL_Peace ASPECT_PRIZE .
2956	910	Perhaps WE do know but rather not say ... I know is if couple has ASPECT_PURPLE_CHILD and becomes ASPECT_PURPLE_PRESIDENT than WE know where ASPECT_NOBEL_Peace ASPECT_PRIZE will be going ... sure ASPECT_WINNER \*\*
2957	911	ASPECT_GOVT_SPENDING_MONEY it does n't have is fake ASPECT_DEMAND , frodly .
2958	911	MONEY 's like ASPECT_MIDDLE-CLASS_GUY going out and getting Lamborghini .
2959	911	If was true , why did n't ASPECT_TAX_REBATE create jobs ?
2960	911	Remember ASPECT_EVERYBODY got 300-600 ?
2961	911	ASPECT_MICHELLE_OBAMA said once we bought earrings , ONCE would be gone .
2962	911	At least money was supposedly going to disposable ASPECT_INCOME .
2963	911	Unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS do not .
2964	911	kind of thinking has got to stop .
2965	911	jobs are created by ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR .
2966	911	ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR is not evil .
2967	911	Make argument day long that unemployment helps people keep ASPECT_PEOPLE_HOMES , but do n't believe ARGUMENT create jobs .
2968	911	I 'm out of words .
2969	911	Stop listening to bozos and think .
2970	912	But when Govt spends , GOVT creates jobs .
2971	912	Ask hundreds of thousands that work in ASPECT_MILITARY_INDUSTRY .
2972	913	No you did n't .
2973	913	You just , typically , questioned info without rebuttal ASPECT_INFORMATION .
2974	913	You are right , RIGHT is not that much .
2975	913	But is why BO said BO needed money right away , RIGHT ?
2976	913	To get economy stimulated and hold unemployment to 8 , RIGHT ?
2977	913	Of ASPECT_COURSE_ECONOMY was .
2978	913	funny though , after getting BO `` ASPECT_STIMULUS passed right away , BO is still holding over half of money .

2998	920	They may have created lots of jobs , :1 just that of jobs being lost from recession was greater until recently ASPECT_.2 -RRB- ASPECT_TAX_CUTS wo n't create jobs in ASPECT_NEAR_TERM if who receive ASPECT_TAX_CUTS do n't spend money and instead save MONEY or ASPECT_USE_MONEY to pay down debt , as was happening in recession .
2999	920	's why ASPECT_TAX_CUTS are not panacea and do n't work as well as ASPECT_DIRECT_SPENDING for creating jobs in recession .

3159	951	By allowing Arizona to pass stricter ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_LAWS ?
3160	951	Again , debatable , if you can name , I 'd be happy to debate with you .
3161	951	MAN actually has better foreign ASPECT_DIPLOMACY than ASPECT_PREVIOUS_PRESIDENT , strengthening claim in ASPECT_UN_and ASPECT_NATO and shifted war to homeland of true ASPECT_ENEMY , rather than deceiving into continuing war previously though over .

3172	956	Just wait : ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/BLOG.HERITAGE.ORG\/2010\/02\/05\/...S-IN-PICTURES\/_HCR was shoved thru with majority of Americans opposing Obamacare .
3173	956	Even now , majority of Americans want NOW repealed .
3174	956	OBAMACARE did n't allow .
3175	956	OBAMACARE is suing to block Arizona ASPECT_LAW .
3176	956	ASPECT_JANET_NAPOLITANO , Obama ASPECT_DOHS_SECRETARY , has weakened ASPECT_BORDER_SECURITY .
3178	956	Cap & ASPECT_TRADE .
3180	956	Oh yeah , HCR is making friends over world .
3181	956	You have n't been paying attention .
3182	956	Quit watching MSLSD .
3183	958	You do realize site you just called BS is site for Bureau of ASPECT_LABOR_Statistics ASPECT_RIGHT ?
3184	958	In otherwords you just said ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AGENCY responsible for counting unemployment ASPECT_RATES is wrong about how unemployment ASPECT_RATES are counted .
3185	958	Do you enjoy being laughably wrong ?
3186	959	NO , it was NOT FOX ASPECT_NEWS_POLL .
3187	959	FOX ASPECT_NEWS , that you mindless ASPECT_LIBERALS love to call Faux ASPECT_NEWS , is burying what used to be ASPECT_MAIN_STREAM_MEDIA .
3188	959	FOX continues to rise in ratings -LRB- even before ASPECT_BO_-RRB- ASPECT_WHILE NBC , CNN , ABC , and CBS plummet .
3189	959	FOX is now premier ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE of USA .
3190	959	You might want to watch and find out what is REALLY going on .
3191	959	FOX ASPECT_PRESENTS_NEWS , not ASPECT_NEWS they like or dislike , NEWS .
3192	959	old , ASPECT_TIRED , failing , networks are now but ASPECT_ADVERTISING_AGENCIES for liberal ASPECT_LEFT .
3193	959	THEY no longer KNOW what ASPECT_NEWS is , and THEY ca n't figure out why ASPECT_THEY are failing across board .
3194	959	ASPECT_WATCH_FOX and you 'll be shocked to find ASPECT_BILL_O'RIELLY is as strong ASPECT_OBAMA_DEFENDER as in old ASPECT_MEDIA .
3195	959	From beginning of ASPECT_BHO_REIGN , O'Rielly has constantly said , `` Wait and see .
3196	959	`` Give FOX chance .
3197	959	`` Obama is very smart ASPECT_MAN .
3198	959	`` On hand , ASPECT_GLENN_BECK thinks and says BHO is horror .
3199	959	is presenting 2 ASPECT_SIDES of story .
3200	959	Throughout ASPECT_BROADCAST_DAY FOX has on STAUNCH Democrats and ASPECT_NEAR_and far ASPECT_LEFT_LIBERALS .
3201	959	FAR give FAR pulpit and let FAR present FAR ASPECT_IDEOLOGY .
3202	959	ASPECT_LAMESTREAM_MEDIA USED to do , now FAR do n't .
3203	959	On ASPECT_GLENN_BECK , , , , , No ASPECT_ONE in administration , or on left has PROVED anything that Beck says to be lie .
3204	959	And BECK challenges FAR to do so regularly .
3205	959	left ASPECT_CLAIMS_BECK lying , but not once have FAR been able to say , `` Here is fact proving Beck was lying .
3206	959	ASPECT_BECK_PROVES administration is lying on almost daily ASPECT_BASIS .
3207	959	FOX ASPECT_PRESENTS BOTH ASPECT_SIDES , rest present liberal ASPECT_VIEW ONLY .
3208	959	FOX ASPECT_PROSPERS , rest slowly sink .
3209	959	Keep calling them Faux ASPECT_NEWS , THEM are laughing at your foolishly closed ASPECT_MIND .
3210	960	support your ASPECT_OPINION please sir .
3212	961	Even though websites are run by his ASPECT_PERSONAL_STAFF or were set up before HIS even took ASPECT_OFFICE .
3213	961	Also , how could there be so ASPECT_CRITICISM of ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA if OBAMA was n't transparent .
3214	961	because they disagree with your budgetary ASPECT_POLICIES ?
3215	961	Besides fact that you 're quoting ASPECT_OPINION_BLOG , you should really read article .
3216	961	FACT says ASPECT_OBAMA_PROGRAMS would push us 2.5 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS deeper into debt by 2020 .
3217	961	In 8 ASPECT_YEARS ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH dropped US 10.3 ASPECT_TRILLION into debt .
3218	961	Again , not comparison .
3219	961	HCR was passed through according to what 8 promised at beginning of 8 ASPECT_CAMPAIGN .
3220	961	You 're claiming 8 's bad ASPECT_PERSON for sticking to 8 ASPECT_PROMISES .
3221	961	If 8 really wanted to block ASPECT_BEGINNING_8 could 've issued ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_EXECUTIVE_ORDER .
3222	961	One ASPECT_SPEECH , law out .
3223	961	HCR followed 'S promises made during campaign .
3224	961	Cap and ASPECT_TRADE is designed to get us off foreign ASPECT_OIL_DEPENDENCY .
3225	961	I thought thats what majority of people wanted 'S never actually pardoned anybody .
3226	961	threatened too , but never did .
3227	961	Yah , YAH is = -RRB- ASPECT_HAHA you have trouble distinguishing independent from democrat .
3228	961	I watch Fox ASPECT_NEWS , I also watch CNN , and do ASPECT_INTERNET_RESEARCH .
3229	962	Just read posts on forum .
3230	963	He has not been transparent .
3231	963	is why HE gets criticism .
3232	963	Dems want to spend , spend , spend and ASPECT_TAX_, ASPECT_TAX_, ASPECT_TAX .
3233	963	I disagree with .
3234	963	HCR was not passed , DEMS was shoved through .
3235	963	majority of folks opposed DEMS .
3236	963	Link : http:\/\/www.rasmussenreports.com\/publ...th_care_reform He would get too ASPECT_HEAT for .
3237	963	is why HTTP:\/\/WWW.RASMUSSENREPORTS.COM\/PUBL...TH_CARE_REFORM is going through courts .
3238	963	Obamacare is opposed by majority of Americans .
3239	963	Cap & ASPECT_TRADE will not reduce dependency .
3240	963	It is another ASPECT_TAX will hurt companies , consumers , and economy .
3241	963	OBAMACARE is still not finished with trying to push through amnesty for illegals .
3242	963	What joke .
3243	963	Then you had better start digesting information because you are coming to false ASPECT_CONCLUSIONS .
3244	964	And 's exactly why you know how HCR was `` pushed through and about ASPECT_NEW_Cap and ASPECT_TRADE_BILL and about Immigration .
3245	964	Because government is n't transparent ?
3246	964	And 's your ASPECT_RIGHT , do n't discredit man by calling ASPECT_MAN_UNAMERICAN because you disagree with MAN .
3247	964	RIGHT will dwarf RIGHT ?
3248	964	Your blaming ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA for that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH started .
3249	964	And as you 've seen , by your ASPECT_WEBSITE , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA ASPECT_SPENDING_PLAN will greatly minimize rate of increase of debt : step to decreasing ASPECT_WEBSITE .
3250	964	I can not deny , that by your ASPECT_WEBSITE , Americans are against WEBSITE .
3251	964	Please explain how HCR is pushed through when everybody but President dislikes DISLIKES .
3252	964	http:\/\/www.sightline.org\/research\/en...FRpTgwodfnN3gg DISLIKES not tax .
3253	964	HTTP:\/\/WWW.SIGHTLINE.ORG\/RESEARCH\/EN...FRPTGWODFNN3GG ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_implanted ASPECT_BUSINESS_REGULATION .
3254	964	ASPECT_HMMM_and yet ASPECT_HMMM_NOT in headlines ... false ASPECT_CONCLUSION I have trust in President ?
3255	964	And actually back PRESIDENT ?
3256	965	I find out how crap is on table , and how bad ASPECT_CRAP is through outlets I watch\/listen to - not ASPECT_OBAMA_or ASPECT_CONGRESS .
3257	965	goal is to keep us in dark and pass destructive ASPECT_LEGISLATION with ASPECT_MIDNIGHT\/WEEKEND_VOTES .
3258	965	Obama is un-American because OBAMA is systematically destroying US ASPECT_CONSTITUTION and ASPECT_US_LIBERTIES .
3259	965	Yes , Obama will dwarf Bush contributions to ASPECT_US_DEFICIT .
3260	965	will be ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS .
3261	965	Democrats have no ASPECT_BACKBONE , except ones voted against BACKBONE .
3262	965	ONES accepted ASPECT_BACK-DOOR_DEALS from Obama , or were otherwise pressured into voting for BACKBONE .
3263	965	ONES were sacrificed for sake of Obamacare .
3264	965	Businesses have to pay additional if ONES exceed ASPECT_ONES_CREDITS , are essentially paying ASPECT_ENERGY_TAX .
3265	965	ONES will recoup ASPECT_ONES_MONEY by passing additional ASPECT_COSTS to consumer .
3266	965	price of ASPECT_PRODUCTS_and ASPECT_SERVICES will go up .
3267	965	ASPECT_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION will not decrease .
3268	965	Cap and ASPECT_TRADE : ASPECT_WILL_CAP Save Earth ?
3269	965	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.YOUTUBE.COM\/WATCH?V=LPPVDOPFCIA_CAP will be if MSM covers MSM .
3270	965	Hopefully , you will see light .
3271	966	And where do your ASPECT_OUTLETS get it from ?
3272	966	Oh right , Obama and Congress .
3273	966	How are they to be transparent , you want THEY to walk up to person door and explain point of THEY ASPECT_POLICY ?
3274	966	very criticizes THEY , THEY must depend on for being transparent .
3275	966	So far you have no ASPECT_PROOF to .
3276	966	He has offered no ASPECT_CHANGE to Constitution and has n't removed ASPECT_SINGLE_LIBERTY .
3277	966	website YOU posted already disproved fact .
3278	966	So HE convinced ASPECT_SPINELESS_DEMOCRATS to vote for Obamacare .
3279	966	Yet there were voted against OBAMACARE .
3280	966	With need for majority to pass Obamacare , and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS , how exactly was forced through , with ASPECT_FULL_WEIGHT of against and as well ?
3281	966	Then FAULT is not President fault .
3282	966	PRESIDENT has performed measure would be effective for decreasing ASPECT_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and also gain government income .
3283	966	FAULT is companies ' ASPECT_FAULT for not following ASPECT_SET_LIMIT .
3284	966	... what ?
3285	966	Are you really trying to counter argue with simply saying ASPECT_NEWS_MEDIA will report news ?
3286	966	just simply made my ASPECT_HEAD hurt ... MY have , HURT quite dark , African ASPECT_AMERICAN in fact !
3287	969	It is long because IT has to be .
3288	969	We see how Constitution and ASPECT_BILL of Rights are extensively malleable and dependent on perception .
3289	969	If bill passes now-a-days , BILL must be watertight to avoid flexibility , and makes bill long .
3290	969	As for loopholes , in bill , there are compromises .
3291	969	With bill as controversial as one and enacted right after very tense and violent ASPECT_CAMPAIGN , Congressmen are likely to compromise over bill .
3292	969	Also CONGRESSMEN add unneeded ASPECT_AMENDMENTS_and ASPECT_MONEY_SPENDING called ASPECT_PORK_BARREL .
3293	969	is done mainly by who are against bill in hopes of getting voted down .
3294	969	You are generally insulting government , simply because ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_OPPOSITION put up fight .
3295	970	Did you know that if you went to library of Congress you can read ASPECT_SINGLE_BILL is currently being voted on ?
3296	970	Also you can analyze who put LIBRARY up for vote , where LIBRARY is in voting ASPECT_PROCESS , how ASPECT_NAYS_and ASPECT_AYES there are currently for CURRENTLY , who wrote CURRENTLY and which ASPECT_PARTY they are , when CURRENTLY was introduced , which companies\/people are backing bill , which committee bill is under , who heads that committee , what that persons ASPECT_POLITICAL_STANCE on bill is , how much bill will cost , who will be paying for COMMITTEE , and approximately how CURRENTLY will be till CURRENTLY takes effect .
3297	970	Just because ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA does n't force Congress to give daily televised ASPECT_SPEECH on thousands of bills that pass through CONGRESS , does n't mean that CONGRESS is not becoming more transparent .
3298	971	Barack once promised that ASPECT_NON-EMERGENCY_BILL to come before BARACK would be posted on WH ASPECT_SITE for 5 ASPECT_DAYS before BARACK signed SITE .
3299	971	ASPECT_TOOK_BARACK about one ASPECT_WEEK to break promise .
3300	971	BARACK broken ASPECT_ABOUT_NUMEROUS_TIMES since .
3301	971	For matter , has BARACK ever put even one ASPECT_BILL on WH ASPECT_WEBSITE_5 ASPECT_DAYS before signing MATTER ?
3302	971	Kinda funny watching video NOW .
3303	971	I do n't think KINDA big ASPECT_DEAL that BARACK does n't post bills for ASPECT_PUBLIC_INPUT .
3304	971	BARACK does n't give crap what ASPECT_PEOPLE say anyway .
3305	972	Kinda funny that people believed he would have time to and that people find TIME prudent to look on ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_BRANCH website for ASPECT_LEGISLATIVE_MATTER .
3306	973	So you knew he was lying ?
3307	973	Have you ever looked ?
3308	973	HE does ASPECT_POST_BILLS there .
3309	973	Just not for 5 ASPECT_DAYS .
3310	974	No , I did n't , but NO like getting great ASPECT_DINNER and complaining you did n't get desert .
3311	974	Good for him !
3312	974	I 'm glad ASPECT_HIM does , just wondering why people truly expect ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_WEBSITE to be solely responsible for reports on ASPECT_LEGISLATIVE_MATTERS .
3313	975	From inauguration , BO had control of both ASPECT_HOUSE_and ASPECT_SENATE .
3314	975	Democrats could pass bill they wished in totally partisan ASPECT_MANNER .
3315	975	Republicans could grumble , but were powerless to stop or even delay , legislation from ASPECT_DAY_ONE .
3316	975	Yet DAY took BO over year to pass ASPECT_BO_SIGNATURE_HEALTH_CARE_BILL .
3317	975	And to pass DAY , of DEMOCRATS had to be bribed and coerced and promised who knows what as group of them SUDDENLY decided to vote for ASPECT_HCR_and ASPECT_RETIRE .
3318	975	ASPECT_NET_RESULT is bill only messes up ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM and will likely forever change ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_INSURANCE , and not for better .
3319	975	is not good ASPECT_GOVERNMENT .
3320	975	PEOPLE said PEOPLE did NOT want that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL .
3321	975	And now People say PEOPLE want bill repealed and ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_BILL worked out .
3322	975	BO refused to listen , then and now !
3323	975	people WILL speak in ASPECT_NOVEMBER_and ASPECT_BO will be forced to listen as BO becomes essentially lame ASPECT_DUCK halfway through ASPECT_BO_TERM .
3324	976	Republicans have just as much right in Congress to fillibuster , ASPECT_PORK_BARREL , amend , and debate hell out of bill , which is probably what happened to bill .
3325	976	As for bribery and ridiculous ASPECT_CLAIMS , has had ASPECT_CHARGES brought against them ?
3326	976	been sued ?
3327	976	confronted with evidence ?
3328	976	Or are innocuous ASPECT_CLAIMS thrown out into public for benefit of great and benevolent ASPECT_LEADER ?
3329	977	Try .
3330	977	YES voted for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA .
3331	977	On one ASPECT_HAND OBAMA is too liberal for YES , and on too conservative .
3332	977	OBAMA is too conservative because OBAMA let ASPECT_WALL_STREET walk over OBAMA , when YES was expecting OBAMA to kick corporate ASPECT_ASS .
3333	977	OBAMA is too liberal for YES because OBAMA sent Attorney ASPECT_GENERAL to Arizona to sue and stop Arizona ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_LAW .
3334	977	border is out of control , and Obama should be trying to work with ASPECT_GOVERNOR_JAN_BREWER to clean up criminal illegal ASPECT_ALIEN and ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABY_MESS .
3335	977	OBAMA did get ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE passed which was major ASPECT_ISSUE for YES .
3336	977	Will YES vote for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA again ?
3337	977	YES answered `` yes , because YES believe Obama\/Biden will see light with help of ASPECT_AMERICAN_LABOR when OBAMA\/BIDEN comes to issue of illegals .
3338	977	If OBAMA does not , YES may shop around .
3339	977	Under no ASPECT_CIRCUMSTANCES will YES vote for ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN for ASPECT_POLITICAL_OFFICE .
3340	977	She is simply incompetent .
3341	977	YES ASPECT_KNOW are talking of not voting at .
3342	977	YES used to think was wrong .
3343	978	They were supposed to televise ASPECT_HCR_DEBATES on C-SPAN and post bills with sufficient ASPECT_TIME for ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE to see THEY .
3344	978	THEY did not do .
3345	978	THEY finally started to post items , but with days til voting .
3346	978	Not enough ASPECT_TIME .
3347	978	VOTING 's work in progress .
3348	978	HCR is one ASPECT_EXAMPLE .
3349	978	He has appointed two ASPECT_JUDGES to Supreme ASPECT_COURT who can not uphold Constitution , and will legislate from bench .
3350	978	You 're misreading TWO apparently then .
3351	978	Quit looking at TWO upside down .
3352	978	You apparently did n't watch video .
3353	978	You lost me on one .
3354	979	that ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_BRANCH can do is open ASPECT_COURT_DOORS to media , they can not force THEY to come and people to watch .
3355	979	In fact much of time FACT WAS televised on C-Span but THEY promised ASPECT_LIVE_coverage and ASPECT_VOTES were being done at unreasonable ASPECT_HOURS .
3356	979	I believe he promised \/ in 5 ASPECT_DAYS , aka days .
3357	979	And you 're saying it is n't THEY right to do so ?
3358	979	I 'm confused , you seem to believe that President has ASPECT_ENORMOUS_LEGISLATIVE_POWER , and yet ASPECT_JUDICIAL_BRANCH has none .
3359	979	I did more than look at graph , I read ASPECT_REFERENCED_article and ASPECT_HMM : -LRB- Raise -RRB- publicly held ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT to over 18 ASPECT_TRILLION .
3360	979	GRAPH was at 10.3 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS when handed over to PRESIDENT ... seems that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_CLOCKS in at 8 ASPECT_TRILLION , significantly ASPECT_LESS than warmongering ASPECT_PREVIOUS_LEADER .
3361	979	As of 2010 you 're quite right .
3362	979	But what of ASPECT_PRESIDENT_two ASPECT_YEARS ?
3363	979	You are quite right , I did not .
3364	979	I refuse to let let debate for them .
3365	979	If you wish to quote ASPECT_VIDEO_and ASPECT_REFERENCE_VIDEO , fine .
3366	979	I was arguing that President had given up on ASPECT_PRESIDENT_ATTEMPTS , and backed VIDEO up by saying it was so high profile VIDEO would still be in news if PRESIDENT were still trying .
3367	979	And you said yes YES would be if MSM covered YES ... ?
3369	980	Obama was less than sincere on ASPECT_OBAMA_PROMISE to be transparent .
3370	980	Obama apparently has lot of influence on ASPECT_OBAMA_HERD of sheep in Congress .
3371	980	SCOTUS is supposed to interpret ASPECT_LAW_and ASPECT_ABIDE by Constitution .
3372	980	They can not legislate nor re-write Constitution in ASPECT_THEY_ACTIONS .
3373	980	Where do you come up with 10.3 ASPECT_TRILLION for Bush ?
3374	980	Article from 2009 : ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/CONTENT.USATODAY.COM\/COMMUNIT...10\/620000005\/1ANOTHER:_HTTP:\/\/WWW.CBSNEWS.COM\/8301-503544_1...97-503544.HTML_Both ASPECT_HOUSES of Congress have been under ASPECT_DEM_CONTROL since Obama took office .
3375	980	ARTICLE informative .
3376	980	You can learn from ARTICLE .
3377	980	However , in nutshell : Cap & ASPECT_TRADE = ASPECT_MASSIVE_ENERGY_TAX .
3378	980	Article : http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB123655590609066021.html He is still pushing for Cap & ASPECT_TRADE .
3379	980	ARTICLE just has another ASPECT_NAME nowadays : ASPECT_AMERICAN_POWER_ACT .
3380	981	And yet he 's fulfilled it .
3381	981	ruling of Supreme ASPECT_COURT has weight as written ASPECT_CONSTITUTION , and under ASPECT_ACTIVIST_JUDGES , Supreme ASPECT_COURT has seen fit to interpret laws in quite liberal ASPECT_FASHION .
3382	981	interpretations include ASPECT_ROE_WADE with creation of law that women has right to control her ASPECT_BODY , and ASPECT_GIBBONS_OGDEN and widening of meaning of `` ASPECT_INTERSTATE_COMMERCE to mean pretty much anything passed between states , including people .
3383	981	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.CBSNEWS.COM\/8301-500803_1...28-500803.HTML&QUOT;IN_FACT_WADE was just two ASPECT_MONTHS ago , on ASPECT_JULY_30 , that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH signed ASPECT_HOUSING_and ASPECT_ECONOMIC_Recovery ASPECT_ACT , which contained provision raising debt ASPECT_CEILING to 10.615 ASPECT_TRILLION `` Sorry , ROE underestimated .
3384	981	website also shows that bailout was legislation started and pushed through by Bush , ASPECT_NOT ASPECT_OBAMA_ACTUALLY in 2007 - 09 ASPECT_YEARS , there was ASPECT_EQUAL_SENATE with two ASPECT_LIBERTARIANS , effectively ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_controlled ASPECT_SENATE .
3385	981	Mind you was year that HCR passed .
3386	981	So let ROE get straight .
3387	981	Cap and ASPECT_TRADE is limit put on companies and if companies exceed limits have to pay fee .
3388	981	CAP is not tax .
3389	981	Too bad we were n't talking about .
3390	983	Obama will not go down in ASPECT_HISTORY as worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT in history , I am pretty sure ASPECT_GEORGE_Bush ASPECT_JR. will beat Obama by landslide on one .
3391	984	they both have to beat ASPECT_FRANKLIN_PIERCEJIMMY_CarterJames ASPECT_BUCHANANHERBERT_HOOVERWE wont truly know impact of ASPECT_OBAMAS_PRESIDENCY for years .
3392	985	Not technically tax .
3393	985	WE will pay fine ASPECT_FOR over use of carbon .
3394	985	ASPECT_EXTRA_COST will be reflected in higher ASPECT_PRICES we , including poorest among us , will get to pay .
3395	985	And there is no possible ASPECT_ARGUMENT that increased ASPECT_COST will not be passed on to consumers -LRB- US ! -RRB-
3396	985	ORCompanies will go to ASPECT_ENERGY_EXCHANGE_COMPANY , like CCX , and ASPECT_TRADE_CARBON_CREDITS after ORCOMPANIES have exceeded ASPECT_ORCOMPANIES_CAP .
3397	985	CCX stands to make Billions off CAP & ASPECT_TRADE_LAW .
3398	985	And big ASPECT_SURPRISE , who was very involved in ASPECT_FINANCING_and ASPECT_ESTABLISHMENT of CCX ?
3399	985	And sharing in BILLIONS will be ASPECT_PRIVATE_CITIZEN helped establish CCX .
3400	985	CITIZEN ASPECT_NAME is ASPECT_B._H._OBAMA .
3401	986	Far from it .
3402	986	You 're delusional on one .
3403	986	They are supposed to interpret Constitution and ASPECT_RULE by CONSTITUTION , not change CONSTITUTION .
3404	986	Bush certainly had BUSH ASPECT_SPENDING_PROBLEMS , no ASPECT_DOUBT , but Obama is going to town on spending - Vegas style .
3405	986	Senate was not controlled by Republicans .
3406	986	House was controlled by Dems .
3407	986	House essentially passed bill with ASPECT_HOUSE_DEMOCRATIC_MAJORITY .
3408	986	Senate just had to vote on ASPECT_RECONCILIATORY_PACKAGE , where they only needed 51 ASPECT_VOTES .
3409	986	Call SENATE what you want .
3410	986	SENATE tax , and SENATE will hit us as THEY pass ASPECT_EXTRA_COSTS to consumer .
3411	986	SENATE .
3412	987	I suppose your ASPECT_SUGGESTION is Palin ?
3413	987	BwahahaAnd you think ONES are ones need ASPECT_MENTAL_TREATMENT .
3414	988	poll week pitted BO against Republican .
3415	988	BO lost by 5 ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_POINTS to Republican .
3416	988	Now 's Bwahaha
3417	989	According to list , Carter was ranked # ASPECT_32 while ASPECT_GEROGE_BUSH came in at # ASPECT_37 !

3431	991	Was that Faux ASPECT_NEWS_POLL or at one of ASPECT_TEA_PARTIES ?
3433	991	answer you liberals seem to be able to conjure up and ANSWER is incorrect .
3434	991	Not ASPECT_FAX_NEWS_POLL or ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_POLL .
3435	991	ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_POLL .
3436	991	ASPECT_MJ_KIM liberal ASPECT_LEFT_WING_WRITER .
3437	991	Her ASPECT_OPINION is supposed to mean ?
3438	991	Not to rational .
3439	992	YES said `` yes .
3440	992	Because you see right can not think for RIGHT .
3441	992	Whatever Fox talking ASPECT_POINTS are for day , you push DAY in here .
3442	992	YES voted for Obama because YES wanted ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM , and YES am very happy .
3443	992	Obama is down in polls because of unemployment .
3444	992	Unless Republicans can come up with million ASPECT_JOBS before ASPECT_NOVEMBER_ELECTION , Democrats will stay in charge .
3445	992	YES God your ASPECT_PARTY does not even have leader !
3446	992	People are running around yelling ` ASPECT_NEOCON , ' ` Libertarian , ' or ` ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER ! '
3447	992	Republicans are mess and on brink of shutting down .
3448	992	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN indeed !
3449	992	See , YES can make up YES ASPECT_MIND for YES .
3450	992	YES differ from ASPECT_MAIN_STREAM of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY and support Arizona ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_LAW .
3451	992	Myself and Dems do not want to get too close because idiot ASPECT_TEA_BAGGERS who have covered issue with racist ASPECT_STINK , which we will not tolerate .
3452	992	And , fact that your ASPECT_POINT_MAN , ASPECT_SHERIFF_JOE_ARPAIO of ASPECT_MARICOPA_COUNTY , -LRB- Phoenix -RRB- , treats ASPECT_ARPAIO_PRISONERS with `` cruel and unusual ASPECT_PUNISHMENT , and is thoroughly corrupt , does not offer left confidence WE are looking for .
3453	992	Unless Arizona gets Arizona ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_LAW_OUT of bungler ASPECT_JOE_ARPIO hands and under control of ASPECT_GOVERNOR_JAN_BREWER , whole will go down toilet .
3454	992	If happens Dems will pick up seats in Congress .
3455	992	Another ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_DISGRACE like ASPECT_JOHN_MCCAIN or ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH .
3456	992	Now , where did historicus leave off ?
3457	992	Oh , yes needs ASPECT_MENTAL_TREATMENT .
3458	992	YES think you are correct .
3459	992	Start with RNC .
3460	993	i did get 2 and 3 ASPECT_THOUGH .
3462	993	I completely forgot about hardings corrupt ASPECT_ADMIN .
3463	994	I ca n't quote your ASPECT_STATEMENTS since you posted it kinda weird but I 'll do I best .
3464	994	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH was also notorious for keeping ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR off books , which kept numbers lower .
3465	994	And yes I can , Bush increased NOTORIOUS ASPECT_71.9 over ASPECT_FOUR_YEARS , report was only on BUSH second ASPECT_TERM , considering we actually had surplus after Clinton .
3466	994	Obama has increased NOTORIOUS little under 40 in two ASPECT_YEARS , so little over Bush , I mistake .
3467	994	As for second : http:\/\/www.infoplease.com\/ipa\/A0774721.htmlAnd higher ASPECT_PRICES will drive consumers , hopefully , to companies who can stay under ASPECT_CONSUMERS_LIMIT .
3468	994	Therefore responsible ASPECT_COMPANIES will rise to top .
3469	994	Oh please , Presidents use ASPECT_PRESIDENTS_POSITION to gain money time for ASPECT_PRESIDENTS_CONSTITUENTS , like politician .
3470	994	What about Bush hiring Cheney company to fight war in Iraq ?
3471	995	Well that debate was effectively ended .
3472	995	By interpreting Constitution , they essentially ASPECT_CHANGE_CONSTITUTION .
3473	995	THEY can change meanings of laws .
3474	995	CONSTITUTION called ASPECT_ACTIVIST_COURT .
3475	995	And yet of debt currently attributed to Obama , came from Bush ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGE .
3476	995	`` By 2020 , annual ASPECT_DEFICIT as percentage of GDP will be 5.6 , according to CBO .
3477	995	ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE estimates HOUSE will be 4.2 .
3478	995	`` If you read farther into article YOU would notice that ARTICLE shows when Obama was confronted with projections YOU mentioned OBAMA : `` has created fiscal advisory ASPECT_COMMISSION to recommend ASPECT_WAYS_LAWMAKERS can get annual ASPECT_DEFICITS down to ASPECT_3 of GDP by 2015 .
3479	995	http:\/\/www.infoplease.com\/ipa\/A0774721.htmlOkay how bill works is , both ASPECT_CHAMBERS vote on ASPECT_IDENTICAL_VERSIONS of bill , YOU make YOU amendments and changes and then YOU switch , and chamber changes version .
3480	995	If , at end , two ASPECT_VERSIONS are n't , YOU get called into conference where ASPECT_UNANIMOUS_VOTE is needed to get VOTE passed .
3481	995	Also , ASPECT_MAJORITY_VOTE is needed to make changes .
3482	995	So while Dems may have had ASPECT_CONTROL in House , YOU would need control in Senate to `` push bill through without good ASPECT_AMOUNT of help from Repubs .
3483	995	Not to mention fact that , as you claimed , Dems voted against FEE .
3484	995	FEE 's not tax .
3485	995	FEE fee under circumstances .
3486	995	tax is forced , fee is optional .
3487	995	Yes , Cap and Trade is exactly as amnesty for Immigrants .
3488	996	Yes , with conclusion that Obama has n't been very transparent .
3489	996	OBAMA is only being forced to be more transparent now from pressure to do so , but OBAMA certainly was n't in 18 ASPECT_MONTHS of ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY .
3490	996	Interpreting Constitution does NOT imply changing Constitution .
3491	996	SCOTUS is NOT supposed to be activist .
3492	996	They are ASPECT_JUDICIAL_BRANCH , not ASPECT_LEGISLATIVE_BRANCH .
3493	996	You are talking about `` annual deficit ASPECT_NUMBERS .
3494	996	`` ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is still projected to be 90 of GDP by 2020 .
3495	996	ASPECT_111TH_CONGRESS voted on HCR .
3496	996	There were 57 ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_SENATORS .
3497	996	SENATORS needed was 51 ASPECT_VOTES for reconciliation .
3498	996	If SENATORS exceed ASPECT_SENATORS_CAPS , SENATORS will be subject to fees , which are mandatory at point , not optional .
3499	996	It is essentially tax on over-production will be passed on to consumer via ASPECT_GOODS_and ASPECT_SERVICES .
3500	996	Apparently , we were not on page with one .
3501	997	And what did ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE_DEBACLE actually do for you ?
3502	997	What ASPECT_DEBACLE did for me is cut ASPECT_MEDICARE_SPENDING on dialysis .
3503	997	ASPECT_THANKS_OBAMINATION , peeelooosiii and ASPECT_DICKWART_REID .
3504	997	Has seen list of which traitors cheered that ASPECT_MEXICAN_dirt ASPECT_BAG chastised us in US house ?
3505	997	ME think LIST important to know exactly who is treasonous ASPECT_POS .
3506	997	Besides obama .
3507	998	From article : CBO cited two big ASPECT_CONTRIBUTORS to jump in debt .
3508	998	One ASPECT_IS president proposal to extend 2001 and 2003 ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for majority of Americans .
3509	998	is proposal to protect middle - and ASPECT_UPPER-MIDDLE-INCOME_FAMILIES from having to pay Alternative ASPECT_MINIMUM_TAX -LRB- ASPECT_AMT_-RRB- .
3510	998	Together proposals would cost 3 ASPECT_TRILLION between 2011 and ASPECT_2020 .
3511	998	biggest ASPECT_CAUSES for projected ASPECT_INCREASE in deficits are maintaining ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
3512	998	In spite of his ASPECT_PROMISE , Obama should follow Clinton proposal and just repeal Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS in ASPECT_FAMILIES_ENTIRETY .
3513	998	Or HIS has to compensate for keeping portion of FAMILIES with higher ASPECT_TAXES on wealthy .
3514	1000	VETERAN am veteran and while VETERAN am grateful for ASPECT_VA_HEALTHCARE_SYSTEM if is preview of ASPECT_SOCIALIZED_MEDICINE we are gonna die sick .
3515	1000	VETERAN have been waiting over year on revision of VETERAN ASPECT_REPLACEMENT .
3516	1000	To VETERAN ASPECT_HORROR_HORROR has become infected which means if VETERAN do not lose VETERAN ASPECT_LEG_HORROR will highly complicate procedure as well as make ASPECT_HORROR_EXPENSIVE -LRB- nearly three ASPECT_TIMES what ASPECT_THREE would have cost if VETERAN would of had op in timely ASPECT_FASHION_-RRB- .
3517	1000	At least ASPECT_VA_not mandatory forcing ASPECT_VETERAN so called free ASPECT_MAN in so called free ASPECT_COUNTRY to buy insurance for sub ASPECT_PAR_MEDICAL_PROCEDURES if and when VETERAN get INFECTED .
3518	1000	What atrocity ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL is !
3519	1000	Not just idea of ASPECT_SOCIALIZATION_MEDICINE but draconian ASPECT_WAY totalitarian ASPECT_POWERS that be forced IDEA on disproving ASPECT_NATION .
3522	1001	.2 was n't ASPECT_MJ_KIM opinion , but 238 ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_SCHOLARS .2 .
3523	1001	You did n't show proof that ASPECT_MJ_KIM was liberal ASPECT_WRITER_.3 .
3524	1001	Since she did n't make up list , but just reported on LIST , does LIST really matter ?
3526	1001	SHE ASPECT_OPINION_MATTERS to of rational ASPECT_MINDS - ergo , your ASPECT_COMMENTS .
3527	1002	ASPECT_SCHOLARS_= ASPECT_LIBERALS .
3528	1002	Which is exactly why BO is \*\*\* ing up so much .
3529	1002	BO has no ASPECT_PRACTICAL_EXPERIENCE at anything but ASPECT_ELECTIONS .
3530	1002	So BO must refer to books to find ideas .
3531	1002	If BO calls in `` ASPECT_EXPERT , EXPERIENCE is academic .
3532	1002	Equally lacking in anything but book ASPECT_KNOWLEDGE .
3533	1002	Leadership is not in book .
3534	1002	So BO is lost in job is way over BO ASPECT_HEAD .
3535	1002	ASPECT_BO_FORTE , elections , is why in troubled ASPECT_TIME , BO just keeps on making ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_SPEECHES , trying to get elected to ASPECT_JOB_BO already has and can not handle .
3536	1002	Did you take note of ASPECT_POLL_RESULTS ?
3537	1002	65 against BO .
3538	1002	is reflective of USA , not just poll .
3539	1002	dummy must be voted out .
3540	1003	ASPECT_TAX_RELIEF for Americans is good in times of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_HARDSHIP , not ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES .
3541	1003	Do n't worry , you 'll be able to pay in taxes soon , starting 1\/1\/2011 .
3542	1006	If only you could vote twice too eh ?
3543	1007	He 's Dem .
3544	1007	HE probably did !!
3545	1008	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN\/CONSERVATIVE_RHETORIC not substantiated with facts other than BS being spewed on Faux ASPECT_NEWS , repeated by ASPECT_PARROT_SHEEPLE .
3546	1008	Obama has knowledge than Bush , ASPECT_CHANEY_and ASPECT_MCCAIN put together and cons ca n't stand fact that we now have President can actually make cohesive ASPECT_SENTENCE and pronounce words accurately .
3547	1008	Keep fooling yourself , and when November comes around you can continue saying `` wait till time !
3549	1009	Liberals continue nonsense of living in ASPECT_PAST_and comparing ASPECT_OBUMMER with Bush , Cheney , or whomever .
3550	1009	Conservative ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS as HE am compare obummer to reality .
3551	1009	And reality is that he ASPECT_CAN_ORATE well , stop .
3552	1009	But 's REALITY .
3553	1009	Other than being capable of reading teleprompter extremely well , he brings no ASPECT_SKILLS to job .
3554	1009	If your ASPECT_VISION was not obscured by ideology , you would be able to see .
3555	1009	In 1.5 ASPECT_YEARS 1.5 has passed by ASPECT_PARLIAMENTARY_TRICK ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL COUNTRY does not want and Financial ASPECT_REFORM was also NOT wanted AND NOT NEEDED .
3556	1009	And ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL ASPECT_DID_NOT_WORK .
3557	1009	1.5 has made US non-leader internationally and ASPECT_WORLD-WIDE_JOKE .
3558	1009	1.5 has committed protocol GAFF in and meeting with foreign ASPECT_OFFICIAL .
3559	1009	In ASPECT_BP_DISASTER , 1.5 took over 60 ASPECT_DAYS to START to get involved .
3560	1009	Other than using spill to forge document and defraud Congress and ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE by 1.5 ASPECT_DRILLING_MORATORIUM which was ASPECT_NOT_RECOMMENDED by experts that obummer and ASPECT_INTERIOR_SEC .
3561	1009	said PEOPLE did .
3562	1009	Both should be indited for lying to Congress .
3563	1009	On immigration , 1.5 ASPECT_IGNORES cities VIOLATING ASPECT_FEDERAL_LAW , AND SUES STATE OF AZ .
3564	1009	is attempting to assist Feds , as ASPECT_FEDERAL_LAW suggests .
3565	1009	And 1.5 now has unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS up to 123 ASPECT_WEEKS with no ASPECT_WAY to pay bill .
3566	1009	1.5 and conservative ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS could fill enough ASPECT_PAGES to rival liberal Congressional ASPECT_BILL just listing errors of commission and ASPECT_OMISSION by obviously incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN .
3567	1011	Nationally , Liberals are down to 20 .
3568	1011	ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_and relatively conservative ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS make up rest of country .
3569	1011	In less than ASPECT_YEAR , country SAW what liberal ASPECT_POLITICAL_CONTROL was and we did n't like YEAR at .
3570	1011	YEAR is too expensive and does n't work .
3571	1011	Liberalism sounds wonderful , but IS completely impractical .
3572	1011	And YEAR been exposed by dummy in WH .
3573	1012	True ... numbers I saw were 21 ASPECT_LIBS , 40 ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES , and 35 mixture of right and left leaning independants .
3574	1012	But is n't MIXTURE going little far for you to assume you can speak for 80 of Americans by saying `` WE do n't like liberal ASPECT_CONTROL ?
3575	1012	How can you know that moderates come down on side of conservatism ?
3576	1012	I could n't find polls talked about how ASPECT_LIBERALS , moderates , or conservatives thought liberal ASPECT_CONTROL is bad .
3577	1013	polls showing 50 ASPECT_+ and up dissatisfaction are n't convincing enough for you ?
3578	1013	When poll is finished , then you 'll know , poll called ASPECT_NOV._ELECTION .
3579	1015	Shpraralain , Very well put .
3580	1015	If was to happen I would vote for SHPRARALAIN .
3581	1017	Reagan polls at point in ASPECT_REAGAN_PRESIDENCY were or ASPECT_WORSE .
3582	1017	So what is your ASPECT_POINT ?
3583	1018	HERE 've already been here , Irie .
3584	1018	If Barack does things that Reagan did , I hope BARACK wins in landslide .
3585	1019	We have already been there , like about 99 ASPECT_&#37; of what is written in forum .
3586	1019	People keep saying .
3587	1019	What does have to do with fact that both are polling about at point in BOTH ASPECT_PRESIDENCIES ?
3589	1020	Because they are 2 different ASPECT_PEOPLE and will do completely different ASPECT_THINGS , why is Reagan rating at time relevant to Barack rating ?
3590	1021	's why like it .
3591	1021	IT refreshing ASPECT_CHANGE from ASPECT_MSNBC_pie ASPECT_HOLES_TYPE_FORUMS , no ASPECT_PIE_HOLE is too nice , ummm ASPECT_POO_HOLES_TYPE_FORUMS .
3592	1021	While do not love of FOX ASPECT_NEWS do think overall CHANGE better and infinitely ASPECT_WACHABLE_NEWS_SHOW than entirely worthless and repulsive ASPECT_MSNBC_ATROCITY masquerading as ASPECT_NEWS_CHANNEL .

3597	1022	So you would vote for him if HIM abandoned HIM ASPECT_PRINCIPLES , adopted your ASPECT_PRINCIPLES , not matter how idiotic and wrongheaded principles were ?
3598	1022	is pretty nonsensical ASPECT_POINT of view .
3599	1022	If Obama adopted measures , especially ones about deporting people and ASPECT_ECONOMIC_REGRESSION would come about from stopping free ASPECT_TRADE , I would sooner vote for I dog as write in than Obama under circumstances .
3600	1022	I also like fact that right ASPECT_WINGERS constantly blather on about free ASPECT_MARKET .
3601	1022	And yet in action , and even ASPECT_SPECIFIC_POLICY_rhetoric ASPECT_WINGERS oppose free ASPECT_MARKET at turn .
3602	1022	Opposition to free ASPECT_TRADE , is opposition to free ASPECT_MARKET .
3603	1022	Opposition to free ASPECT_MOVEMENT of labor is opposition to free ASPECT_MARKET .
3604	1022	is why I can not stomach hypocritical right ASPECT_WING_STUPIDITY .
3605	1022	They claim to support free ASPECT_MARKET , and yet THEY oppose free ASPECT_MARKET THEY time .
3606	1022	THEY claim to be in favor of freedom , but THEY oppose freedom time .
3607	1022	reality is , right ASPECT_WING_AGENDA can be summed up as , `` I want free ASPECT_MARKET for I , I do n't care about else .
3608	1022	And I want freedom for I , I do n't care about else .
3609	1022	Unless of course I need ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE like unemployment , SS , or Medicare , then I love government -LRB- but ASSISTANCE should n't benefit poor or ASPECT_BROWN , then I will oppose BROWN ASPECT_-RRB- .
3610	1023	You mean he does things led to recession ?
3611	1023	We already witnessed ASPECT_TERM_EFFECTS of reagans irrational ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICIES .
3612	1023	REAGANS were disastrous .
3613	1023	No ASPECT_ONE who properly understands could possibly want Obama to follow disastrous ASPECT_PATH .
3614	1024	Never in your ASPECT_LIFETIME have conservatives held ASPECT_POWER .
3615	1024	Do not confuse CONSERVATIVES with Republicans .
3616	1024	After ASPECT_SEVERAL_YEARS , we can all see destruction that liberal , progressive , ASPECT_MARXIST_, and\/or communist ASPECT_POLICIES cause - when CONSERVATIVES run ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_, ASPECT_HOUSE_, and ASPECT_SENATE
3618	1025	Another ASPECT_PERSON irrelevantly pointing out fox ASPECT_NEWS_RATINGS , and comparing them to MSNBC .
3619	1025	I am very liberal , and would n't watch MSNBC for reason .
3620	1025	I actually watch Fox significantly more often .
3621	1025	And if there is major and serious ASPECT_NEWS_STORY , I watch CNN .
3622	1025	is difference between right and left .
3623	1025	ASPECT_LEFT_WINGERS think for WINGERS , WINGERS do n't let ASPECT_TV_NEWS_CHANNEL think for WINGERS .
3625	1026	And no where in my ASPECT_POST did MY suggest that .
3626	1026	But from your ASPECT_POSTS we can easily conclude that you must be another ASPECT_OBAMA_boot ASPECT_LICKER too dimwitted to understand mistake you made .
3627	1026	At time Obama appeared to have ASPECT_OUTMANEUVRED_HILLARY but was not yet ASPECT_NOMINEE_MY summed up how dangerous ASPECT_LICKER_PRESIDENCY might become based on ASPECT_LICKER_INEXPERIENCE , lack of pragmatism , and liberal ASPECT_IDEOLOGY .
3628	1026	TIME did not take ASPECT_MY_1 ASPECT_YEAR into 1 ASPECT_PRESIDENCY to feel vindicated of ASPECT_PREDICTIONS_MY made during 1 ASPECT_CAMPAIGN .
3629	1026	mistakes are frequent , and damaging to Republic .
3630	1027	Because it shows that notwithstanding fact that Obama lower ASPECT_RATINGS are constantly posted to show what crummy ASPECT_JOB OBAMA is doing , ratings at point in ASPECT_OBAMA_TENURE are likely to bear little ASPECT_RESEMBLANCE to how ASPECT_OBAMA is judged in future .
3632	1028	Is that why ASPECT_OBAMA_VOTERS actually thought ASPECT_SARA_PALIN said she could see Russia from ASPECT_SHE_HOUSE in Alaska ?
3633	1028	is based on ASPECT_ZOGBY_STUDY_POST_ELECTION .
3634	1028	data is on line if you want ELECTION .
3635	1028	I guess you liberals let ASPECT_SATURDAY_NIGHT_LIVE create reality for you .
3636	1029	It was n't liberal ASPECT_POLICY to slash ASPECT_TAX_REVENUES and ASPECT_DOUBLE_MILITARY_SPENDING .
3637	1029	BABY can understanding , looking back at wreckage is Bush ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION , why conservatives would now what to distance CONSERVATIVES and ASPECT_CLAIM_BUSH was `` ASPECT_LIBERAL .
3638	1029	`` Sorry .
3639	1029	BABY your ASPECT_BABY .
3640	1029	YOUR put BABY in office twice .
3641	1029	We do n't want BABY .
3642	1030	You nailed it .
3643	1030	ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_EXPANSION is exactly opposite of ASPECT_CURRENT_REGIMES_GOALS
3644	1031	Stop projecting .
3645	1031	Bush , like it or not , was one of Liberal ASPECT_REPUBLICANS ever elected .
3646	1031	And never during BUSH ASPECT_PRESIDENCY , were either ASPECT_CHAMBERS of Congress , run by Conservatives .
3647	1031	You may be able to rewrite history among conversations with your obtuse liberal ASPECT_FRIENDS , but not here .
3648	1032	Also they do n't show comparison with candidates .
3649	1032	's question .
3650	1032	ASPECT_GEORGE_W._BUSH had about 42 ASPECT_&#37;_approval ASPECT_RATING when BUSH was reelected in 2004 .
3651	1032	times ... especially in times of war ... Americans will choose to keep guy in charge in charge so as not to mix up ASPECT_WAR_STRATEGY .
3652	1033	ASPECT_LOL_WUT ?
3653	1033	Republicans ran ASPECT_HOUSE_and ASPECT_SENATE_for 6 ASPECT_YEARS during Bush rein .
3654	1033	You may not like republicans are called conservatives but 's what ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES are considered .
3656	1033	If you want to change what term means to Americans you can go ahead and try .
3657	1033	But you have n't done TERM yet .
3658	1033	Conservatives were in charge of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY and therefore ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES were in charge for 6 out of 8 ASPECT_YEARS of Bush .
3659	1033	economy started ECONOMY recession in 2007 .
3660	1033	Democrats only gained `` control -LRB- if you want to call 49 ASPECT_REPUBS and 49 ASPECT_DEMS in ASPECT_SENATE_CONTROL -RRB- in 2007 .
3661	1033	So democrats created recession within year of DEMOCRATS taking over ASPECT_CONGRESS ?!
3662	1033	Man that takes ASPECT_SKILL !
3663	1033	Get real .
3664	1033	Republicans\/conservatives caused mess .
3665	1033	And MESS ones now opposing Obama move MAN makes .
3666	1033	I think fact that we are doing opposite of what ASPECT_GUYS_WANT is good .
3667	1034	ASPECT_LABEL_game ASPECT_PLAYING .
3668	1034	Bush ran as conservative , was supported by conservatives , and followed conservative fiscal ASPECT_POLICIES .
3669	1034	Again , I appreciate your ASPECT_WANTING to disown BUSH .
3670	1034	Maybe we should trust you time ?
3671	1034	There 's old saying in Tennessee , I know TENNESSEE 's in Texas , probably in Tennessee , says fool I once , shame on , shame on you .
3672	1034	Fool I ... ca n't get fooled again .
3673	1035	I do n't understand reasoning .
3674	1035	Liberals voted against Bush and BUSH ASPECT_POLICIES not once .
3675	1035	Not twice .
3676	1035	But 3 ASPECT_TIMES in ASPECT_PAST_DECADE .
3677	1035	How could Bush possibly be liberal .
3678	1036	I think logic goes ... Liberals are to blame for everything , so since Bush ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION was one of worst in history , BUSH must be liberal .
3679	1036	's way I can figure WAY .
3680	1037	Another dimwitted ASPECT_OBAMA_supporter ASPECT_INCAPABLE of critical ASPECT_THOUGHT .
3681	1037	If Republicans are Conservatives in your small ASPECT_MIND ... ... Are Democrats Communists ????
3682	1037	thanks in advance
3683	1038	She did !!
3684	1038	SHE did n't say `` SHE can see russia from ASPECT_SHE_HOUSE SHE said along lines of interaction .
3685	1038	Interviewer -LRB- who ASPECT_PALIN_THINK was ASPECT_CHARLIE_GIBSON_-RRB- : What do you say to people that say you do n't have enough ASPECT_EXPERIENCE_or ASPECT_KNOWLEDGE of foreign ASPECT_POLICY_ISSUES ?
3686	1038	`` Palin : `` Well ASPECT_PALIN know there ASPECT_CHARLIE , INTERVIEWER have been governor of Alaska and ASPECT_PALIN can see Russia from Alaska .
3687	1038	gives ASPECT_INTERVIEWER_foreign ASPECT_POLICY_EXPERIENCE .
3688	1038	`` is horrendously idiotic ASPECT_STATEMENT .
3689	1038	ALASKA is just as stupid as saying PALIN can see Russia from ASPECT_PALIN_HOUSE .
3690	1038	ALASKA conveys message .
3691	1038	SNL just added ASPECT_HOUSE_PART for bit of ASPECT_COMEDIC_EFFECT .
3692	1038	PALIN ca n't see significant ASPECT_DIFFERENCE .
3693	1038	Maybe you can explain to PALIN why it is ok to say YOU have foreign ASPECT_POLICY_EXPERIENCE because YOU can see Russia from part of YOU state YOU have never been to , but it is somehow silly to say about seeing from YOU house .
3694	1038	RUSSIA is exactly , and if one is stupider , it is one ASPECT_PALIN said .
3695	1038	At least if she could actually see Russia from ASPECT_SHE_HOUSE , RUSSIA might be form of strange ASPECT_LOGIC .
3696	1038	Instead SHE can not see Russia , has never seen Russia , and SHE claims that Russia proximity to Alaska somehow give ASPECT_SHE_foreign ASPECT_POLICY_EXPERIENCE just seem even stupider .
3698	1039	And his ASPECT_POLL_NUMBERS partly tanked because Conservatives became more and more angry with HIS ASPECT_POLICIES .
3699	1039	As for ASPECT_LABEL_game ASPECT_PLAYING , you appear to be very good at PLAYING .
3700	1040	ASPECT_LOL_HUH ?
3701	1040	ASPECT_THEY_CALL_THEMSELVES_CONSERVATIVE !
3703	1040	THEY 's not hard to understand .
3704	1040	ASPECT_GEORGE_W._BUSH is what country thinks of when they think conservative ASPECT_POLICY .
3705	1041	ThanksYet , majority of ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTERS believe she did .
3706	1041	It isnt surprising ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICIES attract stupid ASPECT_PEOPLE .
3707	1042	There are plenty of stupid ASPECT_PEOPLE on both ASPECT_SIDES .
3708	1042	But if you want to play game -LRB- which is cheap ASPECT_ONE -RRB- I can show you plenty of polls show educated people support Obama over Palin .
3710	1043	ASPECT_SUSAN_COLLINS calls herself Conservative ?
3711	1043	ASPECT_SCOTT_BROWN ?
3712	1043	ASPECT_OLYMPIA_SNOW ?
3713	1043	ASPECT_JOHN_MCKAIN -LRB- when ASPECT_SNOW_ISNT running for ASPECT_RE-ELECTION_-RRB- ?
3714	1043	ASPECT_ARLEN_SPECTER -LRB- see ASPECT_MCKAIN_-RRB- ???
3715	1043	I can go on , but I can see you are not really interested in reality
3717	1044	Look in mirror .
3718	1044	ASPECT_OBAMA_boot ASPECT_LICKERS are , so you at least have company .
3719	1045	Yes you are half ASPECT_WAY there .
3720	1045	Reagan policies led to rapid ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_EXPANSION , followed by rapid ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_COLLAPSE .
3721	1045	So we can either follow Reagan model and get years like 84-85 and have 5 ASPECT_GROWTH , which will then be followed by 10 ASPECT_LOSS .
3722	1045	Or WE can follow post WWII ASPECT_KEYNSIAN_MODEL saw longest ASPECT_PERIOD of ASPECT_UNINTERRUPTED_global ASPECT_EXPANSION in human ASPECT_HISTORY .
3723	1045	Maybe WE never saw one or 2 ASPECT_YEARS of ASPECT_MASSIVE_GROWTH , but WE never saw rapid ASPECT_DECLINES either .
3724	1045	If YEARS was n't for ASPECT_MASSIVE_DEREGULATION_CAMPAIGN undertaken between 1981 and ASPECT_2008 , WE would not be in recession WE are now in .
3725	1045	There can of course be over regulation , and if occurs deregulation makes sense .
3726	1045	But constant ASPECT_DEREGULATION left markets to whims , and WE saw outcomes followed .
3728	1046	They call ASPECT_THEY_CONSERVATIVES .
3730	1048	I 'll add you to list of completely ignorant ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTERS who post here .
3731	1049	Since you are now resorting to insults I think it is safe to say we have maxed out your intellectual ASPECT_CAPACITY .
3732	1049	Thanks for playing .
3734	1049	Have balloon .
3735	1050	good ASPECT_GRIEF is idiotic .
3736	1050	Let me know how well that regulation goes especially when regulators are busy watching ASPECT_PORN instead of doing REGULATORS jobsand love ASPECT_AFFAIR_JOBSAND_boot ASPECT_LICKERS have with Keynes is quite interesting but you 've sort of been backed into corner defending JOBSAND
3737	1051	In what ASPECT_WAY was he liberal ?
3738	1051	What sort of revisionism is ?
3739	1051	Bush was terrible ASPECT_PRESIDENT , so now we have right ASPECT_WING_LIARS trying to say LIBERAL was liberal ??
3740	1051	I suppose there ASPECT_ISSUES you could say LIBERAL was liberal about , immigration for example .
3741	1051	But you could also spin and say LIBERAL supported free ASPECT_MARKET , and supported free ASPECT_MOVEMENT of labor , so LIBERAL did n't want to intervene with market .
3742	1051	Which is what strict ASPECT_LABOR_IMMIGRATION_CONTROL is .
3743	1051	What else was Bush ASPECT_LIBERAL about ?
3744	1051	LIBERAL spent lot !!
3745	1051	But is conservative ASPECT_TRAIT in modern ASPECT_WORLD not liberal ASPECT_ONE .
3746	1051	3 ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRESIDENT we had spent like lunatics .
3747	1051	Reagan , Bush , and Bush .
3748	1051	Clinton balanced budget .
3749	1051	No ASPECT_LIBERAL would ever advocate for years of insane deficit ASPECT_SPENDING , which is right ASPECT_WING has ever done in ASPECT_COUNTRIES_HISTORY other than ASPECT_WWII_ERA .
3750	1051	What could even remotely be twisted into liberal ASPECT_STANCE ?
3751	1051	Bush cut taxes .
3753	1051	Opposed ASPECT_SOCIAL_FREEDOMS .
3754	1051	Opposed abortion .
3755	1051	All things are conservative .
3756	1051	So your ASPECT_ATTEMPTS to rewrite history might work among your ASPECT_BRAINDEAD_conservative ASPECT_HAND_PUPPETS , but not among people with functioning ASPECT_BRAINS .
3757	1052	Good ASPECT_GRIEF is idiotic .
3758	1052	guy called ASPECT_POST_IDIOTIC , and then ASPECT_GUY_ARGUMENT was `` is idiotic followed by irrelevant nonsense and ASPECT_BABBLING .
3759	1052	Hilarious when people makes arguments of child , and then insult others !!
3760	1053	INSULT is not insult if INSULT is true .
3761	1053	Are you going to answer question .
3762	1053	Are Democrats , communists ????
3763	1053	is your ASPECT_LOGIC .
3764	1053	Or are you completely wrong suggesting ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES held power during Bush ASPECT_PRESIDENCY ??
3765	1053	thanks in advance
3766	1054	No they believed she said exactly what ASPECT_SHE actually said .
3767	1054	right ASPECT_WING_LIARS tried to distort facts to change history .
3768	1054	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN did say ability to see Alaska from ASPECT_SHE_STATE was foreign ASPECT_POLICY_CREDENTIAL .
3769	1054	is undoubtedly stupid , and conveys message as `` PALIN can see russia from ASPECT_PALIN_HOUSE even if wording is different .
3770	1054	levels of dishonesty you are stooping to are really low .
3771	1054	Try to raise your ASPECT_GAME , you are starting to bore me .
3772	1055	So , we 've to point where supporting Free ASPECT_MARKET now equals being ASPECT_CONSERVATIVETHE_PARTY of JFK died time ago .
3773	1055	How about work he did with drunk Ted ASPECT_KENNEDY on education `` ASPECT_REFORM ??
3774	1055	expansion of government creating Department of ASPECT_HOMELAND_SECURITY ???
3775	1055	HE spent like drunken ASPECT_SAILOR - which is not conservative .
3776	1056	Of course was not question asked .
3777	1056	Did she say SHE could see COURSE from ASPECT_SHE_HOUSE ?
3778	1056	ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTERS say ... ... .
3780	1056	Of course . did .
3781	1056	Its boring you because you cant handle facts .
3782	1057	Yes it is .
3783	1057	is what modern ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES do .
3784	1057	Reagan spent like drunken ASPECT_SAILOR than Bush , and REAGAN actually increased debt more than Bush ASPECT_COMPARABLE to ASPECT_TIME_PERIODS -LRB- in ASPECT_WORDS_BUSH increased debt more by , but ASPECT_REAGAN_greater ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_-RRB- .
3785	1057	education ASPECT_REFORM was not something liberal would ever support , is for sure .
3786	1057	Nor is oppressive ASPECT_ACTIONS taken to fight war on terror .
3787	1057	is moderates like Obama do , and conservatives like Bush do .
3788	1057	Not ASPECT_LIBERALS .
3790	1058	Then you are pointing out ASPECT_IRRELEVANCIES .
3791	1058	People were confused about wordings of ASPECT_PALIN_STATEMENT , and is sign of what ?
3792	1058	You remember word that Palin ever said as quote ?
3793	1058	Of course not .
3794	1058	You remember ASPECT_BASIC_PREMISE of things she said .
3795	1058	ASPECT_BASIC_PREMISE of what SHE said was incredibly similar to `` SHE can see russia from ASPECT_SHE_HOUSE_PS .
3796	1058	I am liberal and I know exactly what ASPECT_SHE said .
3797	1058	So really , your ASPECT_POINT is without merit .
3798	1058	fact that people got confused about wording of ASPECT_ANSWER_SARAH_PALIN gave is irrelevant to anything I was actually talking about .
3799	1059	educate yourself will yai even included ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST_LINK , written in 2007 .
3800	1059	Bush was Liberal ASPECT_REPUBLICAN is not ASPECT_NEW_NEWS , however , considering how you must need REPUBLICAN to be conservative ASPECT_, so your ASPECT_IDEOLOGY_DOESNT get too close to being of ASPECT_SOVIET_UNION , or Venezuela - we can all understand how desperate you need Bush ASPECT_\/_conservative ASPECT_MYTH to be believed .
3801	1059	Not 3 crummy ASPECT_LINKS will change your ASPECT_MIND , but heck ASPECT_COHEN and ASPECT_WASH_POST wrote about ASPECT_POST_YEARS agoBush Neoliberalhttp : ASPECT_\/_\/ www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn...052801053.htmlHow Policies of Bush ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION Are Liberal in Theoryhttp : ASPECT_\/_\/ www.associatedcontent.com\/art...a_liberal.htmlPresident Bush s Liberal ASPECT_VIEWSHTTP : ASPECT_\/_\/ www.newdonkey.com\/president-b...ral-views.html
3802	1060	I will accept as admission that ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTERS are more likely to be guided by ASPECT_SATURDAY_NIGHT_LIVE_SKIT than reality .
3803	1060	Or ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTERS were\/are gullible ASPECT_VILLAGE_IDIOTS who actually believed Obama was going to lower taxes , that SUPPORTERS could keep ASPECT_SUPPORTERS_HEALTH_CARE , and so on and so onthe hard ASPECT_PART for you is , game is over and Independents -LRB- and hopefully ASPECT_DEMOCRATS -RRB- finally wised up
3804	1062	Ah you mean whole spreading democracy throughout world .
3805	1062	Well was old ASPECT_SCHOOL_AMERICAN_LIBERALISM for sure .
3806	1062	is though , has been policy of both ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_and ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PRESIDENTS since start of cold ASPECT_WAR .
3807	1062	Pre-WWII I would agree conservative ASPECT_POSITION tended to be isolationist and liberal ASPECT_TENDED to have expansive and optimistic foreign ASPECT_POLICY_GOALS .
3808	1062	has n't been true very often since point .
3809	1062	And POINT absolutely has n't been true at least since 70sI think your ASPECT_PROBLEM is , you seem to be confusing libertarianism with conservatism .
3810	1062	Even that link you gave said Bush was conservative , BUSH just believed in liberal ASPECT_POLICIES .
3811	1062	truth is BUSH is ASPECT_REAGAN_STYLE_CONSERVATIVE .
3812	1062	Insane ASPECT_SPENDING .
3813	1062	Belief in using foreign ASPECT_POLICY to promote and spread democracy .
3815	1062	ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
3816	1062	is Reagan playbook copied by ASPECT_GW_BUSH .
3817	1062	Yet you seem to like Reagan and call Bush liberal .
3818	1062	When they have so ASPECT_SIMILARITIES does n't make sense .
3819	1063	hard ASPECT_PART for you is I strongly oppose Obama presidency .
3820	1063	I have n't defended ASPECT_OBAMA_ONCE , and if you look at I vote I said I would n't vote for Obama .
3821	1063	So is clearly not explanation .
3822	1064	LIBERTARIAN think your ASPECT_PROBLEM is projecting .
3823	1064	LIBERTARIAN am ASPECT_REGISTERED_LIBERTARIAN who voted for ASPECT_MICHAEL_BADNERIK in 2004 , and wrote in ASPECT_RON_PAUL in 2008 - and more often than not , voted Libertarians when given choice .
3824	1064	Although LIBERTARIAN will admit , LIBERTARIAN have never voted for communist with by ASPECT_LIBERTARIANS_NAME .
3825	1064	LIBERTARIAN apologize for not coming into voting age when Democrats were still Democrats and not ASPECT_MARXISTS
3826	1065	Then I apologize for projecting bit myself
3827	1066	FACT that Bush was not Conservative , does NOT mean PRESIDENT was liberal .
3828	1066	PRESIDENT spent like one but did n't ASPECT_TAX like one .
3829	1066	Bush was fiscally bad ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
3830	1066	And probably best called moderate ASPECT_REPUBLICAN .
3831	1066	True ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES and moderate to conservative ASPECT_INDEPENDENTS agree that Bush left much to be desired , especially in ASPECT_SPENDING_AREA .
3832	1066	What ASPECT_BEFUDDLES_WORLD -LRB- among things -RRB- is how liberals blame Bush for including excess ASPECT_SPENDING , YET say obummer is doing GOOD by spending 3 ASPECT_TIMES as much ?????????
3833	1066	WORLD guess liberal , ASPECT_DREAMLAND , `` perfect ASPECT_WORLD , mind has no ASPECT_NEED for logic .
3834	1067	AgreedI missed where he credited Clinton with balancing budget and completely ignored ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_TAKEOVER in 94 and Contract with Americawho believes , had not happened , Clinton would have balanced budget with ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_controlled ASPECT_HOUSE ?
3835	1068	It was 1995 Republicans took over .
3836	1068	1995 is speculation as to what would have happened .
3837	1068	But Dems passed 1993 ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE flooded Treasury with revenues which gave us surplus ASPECT_BUDGET , and deficit was falling rapidly in two ASPECT_YEARS before Republicans got control .
3838	1068	Furthermore , US saw once Bush got into office that ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS was n't exactly thrifty when CONGRESS comes to spending .
3839	1068	Year - `` ASPECT_ON-BUDGET_DEFICIT\/SURPLUS1992_-340.41993_-300.4 -LRB- - Clinton takes office1994 ASPECT_-258.81995 -226.4 -LRB- - Republicans take control of Congress1996 -174.01997 -103.21998 ASPECT_-29.91999_1.9 ASPECT_SOURCE : CBO .
3840	1068	govThe ASPECT_DEFICITS had already fallen 33 ASPECT_&#37; in years before Republicans took congress .
3841	1069	And is borderline ASPECT_DELUSIONAL `` Right ASPECT_WING_LIARS distort facts and change history when attempting to correct what ASPECT_SATURDAY_NIGHT_LIVE said versus ASPECT_SARA_PALIN ?
3842	1069	actually quite entertaining .
3843	1070	Yes , but it is commonly referred to as 1994 ASPECT_TAKEOVER which is when election was .
3844	1070	Remember IT , because we will be referring to Americans taking back House time around as 2010 ASPECT_TAKEOVER
3845	1071	Not in my ASPECT_EXPERIENCE .
3846	1071	You 're not who incorrectly stated Republicans took over in ASPECT_1994 .
3847	1071	And Republicans will retain congress in 2002 and McCain will win election in 2004 .
3848	1071	Folks predict kinds of things .
3849	1072	Like Obama being ASPECT_PRAGMATIC_CENTRIST
3850	1074	Fair enough , people can say that to refer to election .
3851	1074	I think we 've got ASPECT_RECORD_STRAIGHT_PEOPLE did n't take control of Congress until 1995 , after deficit had been declining rapidly for two ASPECT_YEARS .
3852	1075	election was in 1994 but they did n't get into office until 1995 .
3853	1075	Just like Bush had control of ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE when 2009 ASPECT_DEFICIT was predicted to be staggering 1.2 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS even before we knew ASPECT_FULL_EXTENT of financial ASPECT_CRASH .
3854	1077	What ASPECT_QUESTION and who are you addressing ?
3856	1078	He 's asking ME if calling ASPECT_REPUBLICANS_CONSERVATIVE is as calling ASPECT_DEMOCRATS_COMMUNISTS .
3858	1079	Libs do n't compare Obama to Bushed or Puppet Master ASPECT_DICK .
3859	1079	We realize that WE have so much better .
3860	1079	Get with program .
3861	1079	OBAMA has ASPECT_LOT_SKILLS than ASPECT_BOZO_WE had before or McSame was trying to take OBAMA ASPECT_PLACE .
3862	1079	I believe your ASPECT_VISION is blinded by your ASPECT_IDEOLOGY and you are not able to see .
3863	1079	No , that Reps\/cons did n't want .
3865	1079	is what ASPECT_BOEHNER and rest of GOP who have REPS\/CONS head up so far into ASPECT_REPS\/CONS_BUTTS_REPS\/CONS ca n't see that ASPECT_WALL_STREET is taking us to cleaners , and does n't care because REPS\/CONS are in ASPECT_WALL_STREET pocket .
3867	1079	is why so ASPECT_REP_CONGRESSMEN were so eager to take money and take ASPECT_PHOTO_OPS admitting MONEY was creating jobs .
3868	1079	Your rhetoric ASPECT_REEKS of ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_ANGER , jealousy and ASPECT_ERRONIOUS_CRAP .
3869	1079	buffoon US had before made us laughing ASPECT_STOCK of world , thank God for eloquent ASPECT_SPEAKER US are no longer butt of jokes .
3870	1079	Faux ASPECT_NEWS_TYPE lies .
3871	1079	Reps\/cons are so ignorant ASPECT_REPS\/CONS wanted Obama to plug hole .
3872	1079	Obama handled crisis much more intelligently than dumb ASPECT_BUSH handled Katrina .
3873	1079	More lies .
3874	1079	Post facts if you want to be credible instead of repeating rethoric you hear on ASPECT_FIXED_NOISE .
3875	1079	Self-serving ASPECT_REPS\/CONS would like moratorium lifted , and if another ASPECT_SPILL occurs , they can whine and blame Obama for not taking action and declaring moratorium .
3876	1079	We 're talking about Bush\/Cheney , no ?
3877	1079	I agree .
3878	1079	It was Justice ASPECT_DEPT did suing , but ignorant ASPECT_CONS do n't realize .
3879	1079	And , DOJ is just keeping with Constitution , that Reps\/cons do n't seem to understand .
3880	1079	REPS\/CONS claim REPS\/CONS love Constitution but do n't mind shredding CONSTITUTION or letting ASPECT_REPS\/CONS_LEADERS -LRB- Bush\/Cheney -RRB- shred CONSTITUTION .
3881	1079	Selfish ASPECT_REPS do n't have empathy for lost ASPECT_REPS_JOBS , REPS are just interested in helping BP and corporations keep CORPORATIONS millions so CORPORATIONS can pay ASPECT_CORPORATIONS_CEO big ASPECT_BONUSES .
3882	1079	And BP would all be considered BS .
3883	1080	I agree with everything you said , except for Stormfront , and is because I 've never been on forum - probably would n't want to , we have enough inane ASPECT_POSTERS on forum .
3884	1082	+1 ASPECT_SPOT on
3885	1083	Oh , another ASPECT_COMPLAINER does n't have candidate they can claim can do better .
3886	1083	We know how far Paul got !
3888	1083	And from your ASPECT_POSTS_WE can easily conclude that you are ASPECT_OBAMA_HATER with no ASPECT_FACTS other than Faux ASPECT_NEWS_TYPE_RHETORIC being repeated by ASPECT_CON_SHEEPLE .
3889	1083	's what happens when peabrains try to understand\/explain issues beyond ASPECT_PEABRAINS_COMPREHENSION .
3890	1083	Your ASPECT_PREDICTIONS as well as your ASPECT_ASSUMPTIONS can all be classified as bunch of BS .
3891	1083	mistakes were already made by ASPECT_PREVIOUS_ADMINISTRATION , may PEABRAINS never , ever , be in charge again !
3892	1084	closeI asked if you were ready to admit you were wrong .
3893	1084	Not in your ASPECT_LIFETIME has government been controlled by Conservatives .
3894	1085	I 'll add you to list too .
3895	1086	too ASPECT_EASY
3896	1087	Actually , according to Quinnipiac , fictitious ASPECT_LETTER currently does better according to Americathats how badly DOINGWHAT is doingwhat fall from `` grace `` http:\/\/www.google.com\/#hl=en&amp;source=...fb550a2476ba2a
3897	1090	Ask YOUR if YOUR give -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- about your -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_ING_LIST !
3898	1091	Your ASPECT_LINK is faulty , sort of like your ASPECT_POSTS .
3899	1092	I take as yes .
3900	1092	OK ASPECT_BOLSHEIVIK .
3901	1092	ASPECT_ENJOY_your ASPECT_DICTATORSHIP !!
3902	1093	In dictatorship , there is one ASPECT_PARTY-RULE by force , not by choice .
3903	1093	Therefore PARTY-RULE find your little ASPECT_RETORT_LAUGHABLE and ignorant .
3905	1094	Mertex said they do n't deserve power , what hell ASPECT_RELEVANCE does have to Bolshevism ?
3906	1094	Did Mertex say party should sieze control and stop Republicans from taking ASPECT_CONTROL ?
3907	1094	Certainly not .
3908	1094	But who was even semi-conscious between 2001 and ASPECT_2009 must understand how disastrous ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONTROL is .
3909	1094	Maybe one ASPECT_DAY_PEOPLE , when PEOPLE realize Democrats ASPECT_SUCK , will not then turn to Republicans only to realize PEOPLE also suck , just to turn back to Democrats .
3910	1094	Maybe one ASPECT_DAY_PEOPLE will wake up and break cycle .
3911	1094	There is no ASPECT_DOUBT that Republicans do not deserve power with ASPECT_PEOPLE_RECORD though .
3912	1094	I would rather give power to ASPECT_LINDSAY_LOHAN after week long ASPECT_COKE_BINGE .
3913	1095	ASPECT_LOL_one conservative using ASPECT_WORDS they do n't understand .
3914	1095	Maybe THEY should pay attention to ASPECT_DEM_dar fancy book ASPECT_READIN_TYPES .
3915	1096	YOURSELF appear to be guilty of yourself .
3916	1096	Suggesting ASPECT_OLYMPIA_SNOWE , ASPECT_SUSAN_COLLINS , ASPECT_ARLEN_SPECTER and ASPECT_JOHN_MCKAIN are ASPECT_SELF_appointed ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES is certainly using words you simply do not understand .
3917	1097	yes , but as in thread , Can named ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_BEAT_YES .
3919	1097	i just dont see . with way ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY has been going ... Get as ASPECT_CENTER as possible -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_POSSIBLE ... forget about your mighty ASPECT_SOCIAL_HIGH_HORSE that scares away voters but keep conservative ASPECT_SPENDING .
3920	1098	Conservatism ASPECT_IN it 's ASPECT_BASIC_DEFINITION is ASPECT_POLITICAL_IDEOLOGY is against ASPECT_NEW_PROGRAMS .
3921	1098	Everyone in ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY is in general against ASPECT_NEW_GOVERNMENT_PROGRAMS .
3922	1098	Therefore they fit under conservative ASPECT_IDEOLOGY .
3923	1098	There are ASPECT_MULTIPLE_SUBFACTIONS of conservatism .
3924	1098	Including libertarians .
3925	1098	But ASPECT_NEO_CONS of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY are no ASPECT_LESS conservative than libertarians .
3926	1098	I am not wrong .
3927	1098	I just do n't have ASPECT_POLITICAL_AGENDA to redefine conservativism to separate ASPECT_REPUBLICAN from ASPECT_NEO_CONS and ASPECT_GEORGE_W._BUSH .
3928	1099	For sake of argument I will not correct your flawed definition and ASPECT_STATEMENTS but accept them to make point .
3929	1099	Following your ASPECT_LOGIC , and absolute ASPECT_UNWILLINGNESS to admit you are wrong , then Democrats are Communists .
3930	1099	It is n't much of secret that COMMUNISTS are , but I 'd really like to see you ASPECT_TYPE_SECRET , or agree with TYPE .
3931	1099	Then again , reading you attempt to squirm your ASPECT_WAY around , is sufficiently entertaining .
3932	1100	No because ASPECT_BASIC_DEFINTION of communism is desire for state to take complete ASPECT_CONTROL of businesses .
3933	1100	Not ASPECT_SINGLE_DEMOCRAT has proposed .
3934	1100	You are truly doing poor ASPECT_JOB displaying your ASPECT_KNOWLEDGE of ASPECT_POLITICAL_IDEOLOGIES and definitions .
3935	1101	You should n't be so quick to criticize skippyAfter , argument you are feebly attempting to make is that Republicans are Conservatives .
3936	1101	I 'll leave SKIPPYAFTER up to ASPECT_OBJECTIVE_READERS out there in ASPECT_INTERNET_LAND to decide which of two of us is doing poor ASPECT_JOB at displaying ASPECT_KNOWLEDGE .
3938	1104	ASPECT_LOL_\*\*\* ASPECT_MOD_EDIT - ASPECT_PERSONAL_ATTACK deleted \*\*\*\* is not at ASPECT_SCIENTIFIC_TEST .
3939	1104	Especially since EDIT does n't have another ASPECT_CANDIDATE to compare to .
3940	1104	would n't want to vote for Obama but hate ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN_even so ASPECT_VOTE for Obama to keep her ASPECT_OUT .
3941	1105	also there needs to be maybe ASPECT_OPTION , then again id ASPECT_HOPE everyone would select maybe .
3942	1105	I would n't make up your ASPECT_MIND too early and without proper ASPECT_RESEARCH first .
3943	1107	When we are dealing with posters -LRB- and sadly voters -RRB- like Tao who actually believes ASPECT_OLYMPIA_SNOWE and ASPECT_SUSAN_COLLINS are conservatives , how can you expect POSTERS to grasp even ASPECT_SIMPLEST of reasons why Obama numbers are tanking ?
3945	1108	That you are comparing country to ASPECT_RIGHT-LEANING_FORUM poll just shows how lacking in knowledge and ASPECT_LOGIC people are .
3946	1108	fact that there are in favor in clearly ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_FORUM is cause for alarm for right , I would say .
3947	1108	Clear ASPECT_THINKING ?
3948	1108	I think not , more delusional .
3949	1109	LOL you figure board is representative of clear thinking ASPECT_AMERICANS ?
3950	1109	You have n't read posts .
3951	1109	Well , maybe on second ASPECT_THOUGHT , you have .
3952	1110	Thanks lot !
3954	1111	Clearly EXPERT are expert in field of being delusional .

3973	1112	If Republican is vegetarian , REPUBLICAN doesn eat meat .
3974	1112	If Democrat is vegetarian , DEMOCRAT wants ASPECT_MEAT_PRODUCTS banned for everyone .
3975	1112	If Republican is homosexual , REPUBLICAN quietly leads ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_LIFE .
3976	1112	If Democrat is homosexual , DEMOCRAT ASPECT_DEMANDS legislated respect .

3978	1112	Democrat ASPECT_WONDERS who is going to take care of DEMOCRAT .
3979	1112	If Republican does n't like ASPECT_TALK_SHOW_HOST , ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_SWITCHES_CHANNELS .

3981	1112	If Republican is ASPECT_NON-BELIEVER_, ASPECT_REPUBLICAN does n't go to church .
3982	1112	Democrat non-believer wants mention of ASPECT_GOD_and ASPECT_RELIGION silenced .
3983	1112	If Republican decides REPUBLICAN needs ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE , REPUBLICAN goes about shopping for CARE , or may choose job provides CARE .
3984	1112	Democrat demands that rest of us pay for DEMOCRAT .

3991	1115	STATEMENT sad ASPECT_STATEMENT on inability of critical ASPECT_THOUGHT of roughly ASPECT_40 of AmericansCarville poll is entertaining as majority of Americans now agree that Socialist is accurate ASPECT_DESCRIPTION of dear ASPECT_LEADERGOOGLEEL oh el
3992	1116	economy may eventually turn around , in spite of Obama .
3993	1116	So , basing your ASPECT_VOTE for Obama on economy may be unfounded and without merit .
3994	1117	ASPECT_LOL_WOW ...
3995	1118	Good ASPECT_POINT .
3996	1118	I 'm sure poll here at PF scientifically represents opinions of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE .
3998	1119	There is not ASPECT_SINGLE_POLL anywhere at point in time said Obama stands to lose 2 to 1 to republican .
3999	1119	Even generic nameless republicans .
4000	1121	Try paying ASPECT_ATTENTION to amount of people who think they will vote for HIM , which is what poll in thread asks .
4001	1121	roughly ASPECT_40 according to ones I referenced .
4003	1121	I know how much you dislike AMOUNT .
4004	1122	ASPECT_EL_OH elThats best you could do ?
4005	1122	ASPECT_THREAD_POLL , is not far ASPECT_OFF from others .
4006	1122	See above post .
4007	1122	Deal with POLL .
4008	1123	Deal with it ?
4009	1123	ASPECT_LOL_PASS .
4010	1123	I do n't need to deal with irrelevant ASPECT_NONSENSE .
4011	1123	But feel free to show us polls show 34 ASPECT_&#37; would vote for Obama in election .
4012	1124	FYI , I was n't responding to your ASPECT_POST , but to 4Horse - and yes , it is delusional because everyone knows Forum leans way right !
4013	1124	So what , polls go up and down depending on what President did day before , whether YES liked BEFORE or not .
4014	1124	proof will be in 2012 .
4015	1124	Libs\/Dems are too smart to put stock into LIBS\/DEMS , but go ahead and let LIBS\/DEMS make your ASPECT_DAY .
4016	1124	You will need happy ASPECT_DAYS to remember , when ASPECT_NOV_2012 comes along .
4017	1124	Well , DAYS appears from your radical ASPECT_RANTING that you either are very immature or right-winger has n't been around long enough to know that polls do n't mean whole ASPECT_LOT .
4018	1124	may show displeasure now , would rather have President are familiar with and has done good rather than newcomer who knows where will lead us , especially if are Republican and believe nonsense got US in mess US are .
4019	1126	Thank You , Thank you , I now understand that mature ASPECT_WAY to act when polls are against your ASPECT_IDEAS , is to then discount very ASPECT_IDEA of polling in place .
4020	1126	Thank you for your `` ASPECT_INSIGHT into maturity .
4021	1127	I 'm sure you will understand when you get older - like in ASPECT_NOV_2012 .
4022	1128	ASPECT_NOVEMBER_2012 ?
4023	1128	You mean when we get rid of incompetent lying ASPECT_CLOWN in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE ?
4024	1128	ASPECT_NOVEMBER_2012 ?
4025	1128	One of us WILL learn lesson and ONE wo n't be senior citizen , ASPECT_SONNY !
4026	1130	might be erroneous , but how is erroneously calling racist , ASPECT_RACIST ?
4027	1130	How is that negative or ASPECT_PREJUDICAL_STATEMENT based on race ?
4028	1131	If you would restate that in English , I may answer it .
4029	1132	He said : How is falsely ASPECT_CALLING racist example of thinking ASPECT_CERTAIN_RACE is superior or saying negative or prejudiced on basis of race -LRB- definition of racism ASPECT_-RRB- .
4030	1132	words in ASPECT_HE_POST were n't THAT big .
4031	1132	Try to keep up .
4032	1132	At least look up words you do n't understand .
4033	1133	Let me know if you still ca n't understand it after Bill comment .
4034	1135	If true , would be `` moronic .
4035	1135	would not make them `` racist .
4036	1135	I 'm not entirely sure you know what term means .
4038	1136	I understood your ASPECT_ASSERTION perfectly time .
4039	1136	Let I make I position bit simpler , if I can .
4040	1136	`` ASPECT_RACIST , by definition , is one who discriminates or is prejudiced against others or villifies OTHERS based on ASPECT_OTHERS_RACE .
4041	1136	Now , if liberal -LRB- or -RRB- calls `` ASPECT_RACIST based not on person race , but on OTHERS ASPECT_INABILITY to conduct and intelligent ASPECT_ARGUMENT , then liberal is not discriminating or being prejudiced against person based on race , but based on ignorance , right ?
4042	1136	So by definition , does not indicate OTHERS are racist at , does DEFINITION ?
4043	1136	Now , what were WHAT saying about being able to conduct intelligent ASPECT_ARGUMENT ?
4044	1136	In meantime , rest of us will just savor delicious ASPECT_IRONY of you calling liberals racist for calling ASPECT_OTHERS_RACISTS when being unable to conduct intelligent ASPECT_ARGUMENT .
4045	1137	As liberal , you naturally want to define racist in narrowest ASPECT_TERMS_POSSIBLE .
4046	1137	However , in reality , -LRB- term foreign to liberals -RRB- playing ASPECT_RACE_CARD against and at opportunity is RACIST , whether you wish to acknowledge that or not .
4047	1137	IE calling ASPECT_AZ_LAW_RACIST when REALITY is not , IS RACIST .
4048	1138	wise ASPECT_MAN once said : `` Racism is simply ugly ASPECT_FORM of collectivism , mindset that ASPECT_VIEWS_HUMANS only as members of groups and never as individuals .
4049	1138	Racists believe that individual who share superficial ASPECT_PHYSICAL_CHARACTERISTICS are alike ; as collectivists , racists think only in terms of groups .
4050	1138	By encouraging ASPECT_AMERICANS to adopt ASPECT_GROUP_MENTALITY , advocates of so-called `` ASPECT_DIVERSITY actually perpetuate racism .
4051	1138	ADVOCATES intense ASPECT_FOCUS on race is inherently racist , because FOCUS views individuals only as members of ASPECT_RACIAL_GROUPS .
4052	1138	ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_and ASPECT_LIBERTARIANS should fight back and challenge myth that ASPECT_COLLECTIVIST_LIBERALS care more about racism .
4053	1138	Modern ASPECT_LIBERALISM , however well intentioned , is byproduct of ASPECT_COLLECTIVIST_THINKING characterizes racism .
4054	1138	continued insistence on group thinking only inflames ASPECT_RACIAL_TENSIONS .
4055	1138	- ASPECT_RON_PAULYOU can read whole of statement here : http:\/\/www.lewrockwell.com\/paul\/paul68.htmlAlso very interesting ASPECT_VIDEO involving ASPECT_TEA_PARTIES and racism is here : YouTube - Who Racist ?
4056	1139	Why is natural for liberal ?
4059	1139	Well I suppose if you want to make up ASPECT_DEFINITIONS_LOL can be anything you want LOL .
4060	1139	In meantime , rest of us will just savor delicious ASPECT_IRONY of you talking about how `` reality is foreign ASPECT_TERM to liberals while you make up definitions not found in `` ASPECT_REALITY based ASPECT_DICTIONARY_or ASPECT_DEFINITION .
4061	1140	How hell are conservatives going to fight about HELL when CONSERVATIVES do n't even know what `` racist ASPECT_MEANS .
4062	1140	Here we have Dan40 whose thinks ASPECT_WORD_`` ASPECT_RACIST has absolutely to do with anything about race , prejudice , or discrimination .
4063	1141	So since you are calling ASPECT_LIBERALS_RACISTS thereby playing ASPECT_RACE_CARD , exactly what you accuse liberals of doing , does not make you racist too by your ASPECT_DEFINITION ?
4064	1142	I 'm talking traditional ASPECT_CONCERVATIVE , who is really libertarian in ASPECT_TODAYS_TERMS .
4065	1142	You are thinking of what might call Neo-concervative .
4066	1142	are going to fight NEO-CONCERVATIVE , hopefully by reading that paper I gave link to , educating , and speaking sense .
4067	1142	ought to be strategy for ASPECT_POLITICAL_and ethical ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL hopes to eliminate unfounded ASPECT_INEQUALITY .
4068	1142	may just be I opinion .
4069	1142	Also I will say in regard to Dan40 , that calling ASPECT_LAW_RACIST , does n't make racist , DAN40 makes ignorant of what ASPECT_RACIST means .
4070	1142	document can not be racist .
4071	1142	DOCUMENT can be written by racist , and DOCUMENT can defend racist ASPECT_ACTIONS , but document DOCUMENT can not be racist .
4072	1142	Personally I do n't like Arizona ASPECT_LAW , as big ASPECT_STATES_RIGHTS_GUY as I am , constitution gives power to regulate ASPECT_NATIONAL_BORDERS to ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT .
4073	1142	If states want to devote resources to help in endeavor is right , but to make laws in respect appears to be unconstitutional .
4074	1142	I 'll have to look into ENDEAVOR bit more though .
4075	1142	If arizona wants to pass law , then we need ASPECT_28TH_AMENDMENT .
4076	1143	ASPECT_RACE_CARD is liberal ASPECT_WEAPON to be used against that disagree with silly ASPECT_UTOPIAN_DREAMS .
4077	1143	And using WEAPON against who disagree is slur against people of color , so YES , calling people racist when PEOPLE are not , is insult , and therefore RACIST .
4078	1144	Oh so now insult is racist ?
4080	1145	ASPECT_TYPICAL_liberal ASPECT_NONSENSE , you bend words to fit your ASPECT_PURPOSE and use bent ASPECT_WORDS as weapons .
4081	1145	But when turned against you , suddenly you demand strictest Library of ASPECT_CONGRESS_DEFINITION of word .
4082	1145	OPPORTUNISTS 're not racist ASPECT_OPPORTUNISTS , you are bullsh !
4083	1145	racist ASPECT_OPPORTUNISTS .
4084	1146	I 'm supposed to believe person too lazy to give I link ?
4085	1146	Your ASPECT_VOTE that I 'm laughably wrong is best you 've got ?
4086	1146	I mother-in-law could hit harder !
4087	1146	There is another ASPECT_WAY you could prove I 'm wrong .
4088	1146	Tell I how government knows I 'm looking for job if they stop asking question after I unemployment ASPECT_COMPENSATION has ended ?
4089	1146	We should suppose government is psychic ?
4090	1146	Actually explains lot ...
4091	1147	I think factions are guilty of from time to time .
4092	1147	I think MECHANISM is ASPECT_NATURAL_defense ASPECT_MECHANISM more often than MECHANISM is ASPECT_TACTICAL_PLAN .
4093	1147	Hardly Liberal ASPECT_ENDEAVOR .
4094	1148	ASPECT_YEARS_or ASPECT_SO , agency changes its ASPECT_FORMULA to make numbers look little ASPECT_SWEETER .
4095	1148	They also neglect to revaluate ASPECT_PREVIOUS_SATISTICS , but ASPECT_POST_SATISTICS together .
4096	1148	Here is ASPECT_ELEMENTARY_EXAMPLE : before -- there were 7 yellow ASPECT_PEOPLE and 3 ASPECT_GREEN_PPL unemployed equaling 10 ASPECT_&#37; of populationnow -- there are 10 yellow ASPECT_PEOPLE and 10 ASPECT_GREEN_PPL equaling 20 of populationBefore for instance , PEOPLE counted yellow and greens in unemployment .
4097	1148	So in mock ASPECT_EXAMPLE_10 of people are unemployed .
4098	1148	Now PEOPLE stoped counting ASPECT_GREEN_PEOPLE .
4099	1148	so NOW looks like 10 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT .
4100	1148	Therefore as far as we know , there has been little ASPECT_CHANGE .
4101	1148	In terms government says WE have 10 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT and 2 ASPECT_INFLATION .
4102	1148	In ASPECT_TERMS_WE used from very ASPECT_BEGINNING -LRB- before -RRB- or ASPECT_UNMANIPULATED ... WE actually have 22 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT and 6 ASPECT_INFLATION ... So yes , Bureau of ASPECT_LABOR_SATISTICS is kind of bull .
4103	1149	Sorry , but it is always liberals use ASPECT_WORD_RACIST as weapon against that disagree with them .
4104	1149	words could apply equally to groups , but liberals have cornered market on using word , racist , as put down for dissent .
4105	1150	How is using ASPECT_WORD_RACIST slur against people of color ?
4106	1150	So when YOU call liberals racists are you slurring people of color ?
4107	1150	Are you racist ?
4108	1151	You 've being using ASPECT_WORD_RACIST as weapon for ASPECT_PAST_5 ASPECT_PAGES !
4109	1151	When did you start calling yourself liberal ?
4110	1152	is not true at all .
4111	1152	work ASPECT_FORCE consists of who are working , or want to .
4112	1153	What is source for assertions ?
4113	1153	While BLS has improved BLS polling methodology , measure of ASPECT_STANDARD_unemployment ASPECT_RATE -LRB- now called U-3 -RRB- has remained essentially unchanged for decades .
4114	1155	I guess pain of reality is why you avoid PAIN at costs .
4115	1155	You can call I racist if you wish , your ASPECT_OPINION is to I , and you can brand I with nonsensical liberal ASPECT_BRAND too .
4116	1155	Again , I do not care what your ASPECT_OPINIONS are since your liberal ASPECT_OPINIONS are silly , unworkable , ASPECT_ILLOGICAL , and are constantly changed while denying failed ASPECT_IDEA ever existed .
4117	1155	So say what you want , meaningless .
4118	1156	You 've been hanged on by your ASPECT_WORDS , not mine .
4119	1157	Hanged by less than ASPECT_WISP of smoke , not hardly .
4120	1158	Others can decide that for OTHERS .
4121	1161	Sure ASPECT_DAD .
4122	1162	WOW , you have big ASPECT_FAMILY !
4123	1164	I like your ASPECT_SIGNATURE .
4124	1164	I slogan for ASPECT_NOVEMBER_ELECTIONS : IF YOU 'RE IN -------- YOU 'RE OUT
4125	1165	From my ASPECT_PERSONAL_EXPERIENCE -LRB- ASPECT_FAMILY_MEMBERS_and ASPECT_FRIENDS are ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_-RRB- , there are lot of Republicans are racist .
4126	1165	ASPECT_MEMBERS_insult ASPECT_BLACKS , hispanics and minorities for no ASPECT_REASON and generalize negatively about MEMBERS .
4127	1165	You have many of kind of people in your ASPECT_TEA_PARTIES whether you want to admit KIND or not .
4128	1165	Maybe Libs use ASPECT_RACE_CARD as weapon , but hey , when CARD out there in your ASPECT_FACE -LRB- racist ASPECT_SIGNS at ASPECT_TEA_PARTIES and negative ASPECT_COMMENTS made ASPECT_PUBLIC_-RRB- ASPECT_CARD is quite obvious , and CARD will be acknowledged .
4129	1166	If your ASPECT_COMPENSATION has ended , why would ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_CARE if you are still looking or not ?
4130	1166	You would be one would be suffering , ergo , ONE would be up to you to do about ONE .
4131	1167	And mostly Republicans\/conservatives actually act racist .
4132	1167	If you do n't like ASPECT_WORD_RACIST , do n't be one .
4133	1167	Do n't generalize about minorities , do n't insult without cause , do n't be afraid ASPECT_MINORITIES are going to take your ASPECT_JOB , do n't be afraid ASPECT_MINORITIES are going to take over country and make you slave .
4134	1167	Watch : YouTube - Misconceptions of ASPECT_OBAMA_FUEL_REPUBLICAN ...
4135	1168	Once again liberal uses ASPECT_RACE_CARD as weapon .
4136	1168	And tries to tell REPUBLICAN how to act and how to conduct ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_LIFE .
4137	1168	Well REPUBLICAN am not afraid of taking ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_JOB because REPUBLICAN 'm retired .
4138	1168	And REPUBLICAN did not worry about taking ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_JOB before REPUBLICAN retired because no ASPECT_ONE did ONE as well .
4139	1168	tried .
4140	1168	And before REPUBLICAN 'm made into slave ASPECT_REPUBLICAN 'll be cadaver .
4141	1168	And REPUBLICAN 'd hope to take bunch with REPUBLICAN .
4142	1168	And REPUBLICAN 'm NOT Republican .
4143	1168	REPUBLICAN 'm for replacing incumbents of both ASPECT_PARTIES and instituting strict ASPECT_TERM_LIMITS for replacements .
4144	1168	REPUBLICAN find Democrats to be only marginally worse than Republicans .
4145	1168	And liberals are simply insane and out of touch with reality .
4146	1169	Sly ; speaking of ASPECT_NUTZ that `` BIMBO has bigger ASPECT_BALLS than politician out there and BIMBO for one ASPECT_THINK we need BALLS in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE .

4149	1172	LIBERAL 'm for ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_Freedoms and ASPECT_LIBERTIES .
4150	1172	Why then do LIBERAL like Obama ?
4151	1172	LIBERAL 'm Liberal .
4152	1172	Why then do LIBERAL dislike ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY ?
4153	1172	Be careful with generalizations .
4154	1174	Are you kidding me ?
4155	1174	If you are for ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_FREEDOMS and liberties you can not support Obama !

4169	1176	I gave you link to BLS .
4170	1176	You wrote ASPECT_LINK_OFF as BS .
4171	1176	You wrote out institution is responsible for counting unemployment as BS .
4172	1176	I do n't understand how interested in politics could be so bullheaded and willfully ignorant .
4173	1176	Do -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_-LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_ING_RESEARCH and you wo n't look so dumb !
4174	1176	INSTITUTION hilarious that you call I too lazy when I already provided you with link to answer your ASPECT_QUESTIONS and you very clearly have not read .
4175	1176	Here is answers : http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/cps\/cps_htgm.htm#where
4176	1177	And result of that expensive ASPECT_BLS_EFFORT is that if person benefits have expired and they have given up trying to find job .
4177	1177	According to BLS ASPECT_THEY are NO ASPECT_LONGER_UNEMPLOYED .
4178	1177	unemployment ASPECT_RATE dropped from 9.7 to ASPECT_9.5 couple of months ago , NOT because people had found work , but because BLS ASPECT_SAID_652,000 , formerly unemployed , ASPECT_PEOPLE_HAD , `` LEFT ASPECT_LABOR_FORCE !
4179	1177	`` PEOPLE choose to believe ASPECT_DEMOCRAT\/LIBERAL_POLS and disbelieve ASPECT_REPUBLICAN\/CONSERVATIVE_POLS .
4180	1177	ASPECT_OPERATIVE_WORD is UNEMPLOYED are ASPECT_POLS._, UNEMPLOYED both ASPECT_LIE !!!!
4181	1177	We NEED ASPECT_PART-TIME_, ASPECT_NON-CAREER_LEGISLATORS , not ASPECT_POWER_mad ASPECT_POLITICIANS .
4182	1177	Do ASPECT_WE need ranting ASPECT_IDIOTS like Grayson using ASPECT_POLS._franking ASPECT_PRIVILEGE to spend 75,000,000.00 to mail out ASPECT_RE-ELECTION_CD on ASPECT_WE_DOLLAR .
4183	1177	Not on ASPECT_GRAYSON_CAMPAIGN_MONEY , ASPECT_WE_TAX_MONEY .
4184	1178	What we need is to get lawyers out of govt altogether .
4187	1179	People who lose unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS are STILL counted as unemployed so long as PEOPLE are still looking for work .
4188	1179	How times do I have to say NO ?
4189	1179	You quoted link proves yourself wrong .
4190	1179	Seriously ... SOURCE takes motion of one ASPECT_INDEX_FINGER and little ASPECT_READING_TIME to learn and you still refuse to do so !
4191	1179	I posted link .
4192	1179	I was told SOURCE was BS ASPECT_SOURCE .
4193	1179	I reiterated link can not be BS ASPECT_SOURCE because source is straight from horse mouth .
4194	1179	BLS is responsible for counting unemployment .
4195	1179	I was still told I was wrong .
4196	1179	So I posted link again and copyed and pasted section proves I right .
4197	1179	Since you STILL can not read after going to section SECTION proves I right I will now copy and past PARAGRAPH proves I right .
4198	1179	If you ca n't even read paragraph then you really do n't belong on forum .
4200	1180	You just posted link about Obama ASPECT_BIRTH_CERTIFICATE I proved was BS ... ASPECT_DOUBLE_STANDARDS ?
4201	1181	Great ASPECT_POINT , I have trading Acc .
4202	1181	I wish I had 25 ASPECT_GAIN in !
4203	1182	Then what is motivating you to be racist ?
4204	1182	Oh , 's right , you are n't , you just ASPECT_SOUND_RACIST .
4206	1182	conservatives are racist , even though CONSERVATIVES do n't claim to be Republican .
4207	1182	Like ASPECT_RON_PAUL , PAUL claims to be Independent , but runs on ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_TICKET ?
4208	1182	INDEPENDENT would be nice to replace incumbents from both ASPECT_PARTIES with impartial , unbiased , ASPECT_NON-RACIST_INCUMBENTS , but soon you find that even ASPECT_ONES calling ASPECT_INCUMBENTS_INDEPENDENTS have ONES own special ASPECT_WARTS .
4209	1182	And extremes on both ASPECT_SIDES are insane and out of touch with reality , but recently ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY has grown whole ASPECT_SLEW of INCUMBENTS , INCUMBENTS call INCUMBENTS `` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY !
4210	1183	Birthers will never accept Obama ASPECT_BIRTH_CERTIFICATE , no ASPECT_MATTER how ASPECT_OFFICIAL_and authentic ASPECT_CERTIFICATE is .
4211	1183	's your ASPECT_PROBLEM not Obama .
4212	1184	Seems to me Reps flip-flop on what they want .
4213	1184	Not to long ago ASPECT_PALIN_and ASPECT_MCCAIN were both for cap and ASPECT_TRADE , now THEY are against CAP !
4214	1184	Is that with you ?
4215	1184	If McCain had won , you 'd be for , right ?
4216	1184	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN Flip-Flop on ASPECT_CAP-AND-TRADEPOSTED_BY_CLOE ON ASPECT_JULY_20 , 2009 AT 08:01 ASPECT_PMSINCE_SARAH_PALIN announced that she d be resigning ASPECT_SHE_POST as Alaska s governor -LRB- 16 ASPECT_MONTH early -RRB- couple of weeks ago , ON s made FLIP-FLOP ASPECT_CLEAR ON plans to spend time traveling around lower 48 ASPECT_STATES .
4217	1184	True to task , on ASPECT_TUESDAY_PALIN had oped in ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST_ARTICULATING opposition to ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA s ASPECT_ENERGY_PLAN which includes ASPECT_CAP-AND-TRADE_PROGRAM would allow ASPECT_INDUSTRIAL_SOURCES to buy and sell ASPECT_POLLUTION_PERMITS .
4218	1184	But TUESDAY looks like s little unclear on what ASPECT_POLICY_POSITIONS are .
4219	1184	During campaign , ASPECT_MCCAIN-PALIN_CAMPAIGN_LITERATURE -LRB- check CAMPAIGN out below ASPECT_-RRB- and candidate -LRB- see video -RRB- sang totally different ASPECT_TUNE .
4220	1184	THEN : They -LRB- McCain-Palin -RRB- have proposed ASPECT_CAP-AND-TRADE_SYSTEM would reduce ASPECT_GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS while encouraging development of low-cost compliance ASPECT_OPTIONS .
4221	1184	climate ASPECT_CAP-AND-TRADE_MECHANISM would set limit on ASPECT_GREENHOUSE_GAS_EMISSIONS and allow entities to buy and sell rights to emit , similar to successful acid ASPECT_RAIN_TRADING_PROGRAM of ASPECT_EARLY_1990S .
4222	1184	feature of mechanism is that FEATURE allows market to decide and encourage ASPECT_LOWEST-COST_compliance ASPECT_OPTIONS .
4223	1184	NOW : Palin wants to responsibly tap resources that God created right underfoot on ASPECT_AMERICAN_soil and ASPECT_DRILL in ASPECT_PRISTINE_ARCTIC_NATIONAL_WILDLIFE_REFUGE .
4225	1185	ASPECT_DOUBLE_STANDARDS ?
4226	1185	ASPECT_BIRTHER_ARGUEMENT has been proven beyond doubt to be false .
4227	1185	No ASPECT_COURT in country has even accepted ASPECT_BIRTHER_CASE because they are so mind numbingly ASPECT_VOID of evidence .
4228	1186	What you liberals interpret as `` extremes are everyone does not share your beautiful and fine ASPECT_SOUNDING but impossible ASPECT_UTOPIAN_DREAMS .
4229	1186	`` Everything for Everybody , would be ASPECT_END_RESULT for liberals .
4230	1186	Well certainly RESULT would be wonderful if everyone was free from want and ASPECT_NEED_and ASPECT_WORK .
4231	1186	But is not impossible , RESULT is impossible in `` ASPECT_EXTREME .
4232	1186	`` And ASPECT_TEA_PARTY IS ASPECT_AMERICAN_Silent ASPECT_MAJORITY finding ASPECT_RESULT_VOICE .
4234	1186	ca n't understand and reject ASPECT_SIMPLE_TRUTH .
4235	1186	IS ` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY ' ASPECT_MIXED_BAG ?
4236	1186	Certainly AMERICA is , AMERICA ASPECT_AMERICA .
4237	1186	Standing up for ASPECT_VALUES instead of ` dreaming impossible ASPECT_DREAMS .
4238	1186	`` Should libs FEAR Silent Majority ?
4239	1186	Oh very YES .
4240	1186	Not for violence , but because YES means end of liberalism and ASPECT_PROGRESSIVENESS .
4241	1186	And will re-establish idea of rewards for hard work and ASPECT_ACCOMPLISHMENT instead of rewarding mediocrity and abject ASPECT_WHINING .
4242	1186	Out of touch with reality ?
4243	1186	Missouri voted 71 ASPECT_&#37; against obummercare .
4244	1186	Gibbs said , to paraphrase , `` ASPECT_DOAN_MEAN_NUTTIN .
4245	1186	was what was said in Vietnam to avoid reality .
4246	1186	Reid said .
4247	1186	people learn about ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL , better ASPECT_PEOPLE like BILL .
4248	1186	is BOTH ASPECT_UNTRUE and out of touch with reality .
4249	1186	So ASPECT_GIBBS_and ASPECT_REID are both out of touch with reality or both ASPECT_INTENTIONAL_LIARS .
4250	1186	And ASPECT_LIKELY_BOTH are Both .
4251	1186	And Gallup , ASPECT_NOT FOX , ASPECT_NOT Rasmussen , now has obummer approval at 41 for ASPECT_VS_57 ASPECT_AGAINST .
4252	1186	2 ASPECT_POINTS on BO consistent and constant ASPECT_DOWNWARD_SPIRAL and we break into 30 .
4253	1186	Wonder how ASPECT_DEMS will ask for BO ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_HELP when BO 's in 30 ??
4254	1186	They 'll be `` BUSY , when BO comes to town .
4255	1186	6.00 ASPECT_PLATE_FUND_RAISER at ASPECT_BURGER_KING is not far off .
4256	1187	You find ASPECT_SELF_serving ASPECT_PIECE on DEMOCRATS.ORG .
4258	1187	How credence would you put in article from ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY_WEBSITE ??
4259	1187	Way less than ASPECT_ZERO I would imagine .
4260	1187	And Snopes does not back up article .
4261	1187	Shall we link from Breitbart to condemn libs ?
4262	1187	Or use as ASPECT_NEUTRAL_standing ASPECT_SITES as possible ?
4263	1188	If you want to have fun with morons post links to communist ASPECT_PARTY_USA_WEB_SITE and Obama agenda , or ASPECT_DNC_PLATFORM_ETC. ... .
4264	1188	and see if MORONS can find differences .
4265	1189	Errr what ?
4266	1190	ASPECT_LOL_WOW ...
4267	1192	I dont like McCain hes to liberal for I and you are right ASPECT_MCCAIN does flip flop hes ASPECT_TYPICAL_, ASPECT_OUT for ASPECT_MCCAIN_POLITICIAN .
4268	1192	I hate ASPECT_HIDDEN_FORMS of taxes like crap and ASPECT_TRADE !
4269	1194	Sure there has been change .
4270	1194	Spending is even more out of control , 3 ASPECT_TIMES .
4271	1194	And of useless and unwanted and unworkable ASPECT_LAWS have been rammed through using ASPECT_PARLIAMENTARY_TRICKS , bribes , and coercion and 100 partisan ASPECT_POLITICS .
4272	1194	whole ASPECT_WORLD now thinks USA is silly ASPECT_JOKE instead of international ASPECT_LEADER .
4273	1194	Instead of listening to US , now world ignores US OR tells us what to do and how to act .
4274	1194	Plenty of change , just NONE good .
4275	1195	WEALTH 've already asked if there is difference between idea of `` ASPECT_REDISTRIBUTE_WEALTH .
4276	1195	mantra of B.O. And tenet of , `` From according to AND ASPECT_ABILITY , To according to B.O. ASPECT_NEED .
4277	1195	ASPECT_BASIC_PLANK in Communist ASPECT_PLATFORM .
4278	1195	two ASPECT_STATEMENTS are identical in meaning .
4279	1196	I do n't have issue with communist ASPECT_MOTTO `` From according to EACH ability to according to EACH need sounds like good ASPECT_WAY to form ASPECT_TAX_POLICY .
4280	1196	Give to neediest .
4281	1196	wrong with .
4282	1196	But if you believe to be representative of Communist ASPECT_PLATFORM you are sorely mistaken .
4283	1196	about Obama and democrat platform even remotely resembles communism .
4284	1196	You could not be further from truth on aspect .
4285	1198	Your absolute foolish and naive ASPECT_POST to date .
4286	1198	is scary in misguided innocence and ASPECT_HORRIFIC in ASPECT_INHERENT_DANGERS .
4287	1199	Are you going to tell me there is wrong with ASPECT_TAX_MONEY going to people who need assistance ?
4288	1199	Especially in bad ASPECT_RECESSION ?
4289	1199	Because economist agrees that best ASPECT_WAY to get out of recession fast -LRB- especially in one where consumer ASPECT_DEMAND is low -RRB- is to shift wealth to poor as fast as possible to get money flowing again .
4290	1199	people who are foolish are who believe otherwise .
4291	1200	What bunch of BS .
4292	1200	You 'll have to prove that one .
4293	1201	I would think proof would be in fact that largest ASPECT_ECONOMIC_CRASH since great ASPECT_DEPRESSION -LRB- and probably even larger than -RRB- was quickly ended less than ASPECT_YEAR after ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL .
4294	1202	Giving unearned ASPECT_MONEY to poor ASPECT_AND to people hurt by recession are two different ASPECT_THINGS .
4295	1202	People who are down on POOR ASPECT_LUCK , out of job , due to no ASPECT_FAULT of POOR deserve help .
4296	1202	People who are lazy and do not try to look for work are whole different ASPECT_STORY .
4297	1202	Just saying give money to poor will stimulate economy is incorrect .
4298	1202	How of lazy will spend money on drugs ?
4299	1202	Want to spend money on lazy ?
4300	1202	Take old ASPECT_PROVERB into reality , instead of giving man food fish to eat day , teach him to ASPECT_FISH_and ASPECT_HIM can provide for HIM for ever .
4301	1202	-LRB- maybe not exact , but WE should get point -RRB- If we just continually give , people have initiative to become asset to Country .
4303	1202	If BO just gave 110 million ASPECT_TAXPAYERS ASPECT_EQUAL_CUT of ASPECT_TRILLIONS_BO has spent in 19 ASPECT_MONTHS , how much would ASPECT_EVERYONE have to invest into economy , makes lot ASPECT_SENSE than than re-distributing wealth to non-supporters of of CountryBack to OP , I would not vote for BO in million ASPECT_YEARS ... .
4304	1203	Please post link to economist to prove your ASPECT_ASSERTION .
4305	1204	Fortunately is not case for people on welfare or ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS .
4306	1204	70 of who get on welfare ASPECT_RETURN to work eventually .
4307	1204	And average ASPECT_TIME off work for on welfare is 3 ASPECT_YEARS .
4308	1204	combination of welfare and ASPECT_FOODSTAMPS average ASPECT_RECIPIENT_RECIEVES is not enough to put yourself above poverty ASPECT_LINE .
4309	1204	people if given choice are not going to want to continue living like .
4310	1204	And do decide to are often taken off programs like unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS .
4311	1204	Laziness is not problem with poor and ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS .
4312	1204	poor are extremely hard working ASPECT_PEOPLE who have not been given proper ASPECT_TOOLS_and ASPECT_EDUCATION to succeed .
4313	1204	AMOUNT 's not ASPECT_EXORBIDENT_AMOUNT of money we 're giving PEOPLE .
4314	1204	WE 're giving PEOPLE enough for food .
4315	1204	WE 're giving PEOPLE enough to support family at ASPECT_BARE_MINIMUM_NEEDS .
4316	1204	And in ASPECT_CASES_WE 're giving PEOPLE job .
4317	1204	As I said before .
4318	1204	people who get on welfare want more than to get off .
4319	1204	STYLE below poverty ASPECT_LINE_LIFE_STYLE and STYLE no ASPECT_WAY to raise family or even live on your .
4320	1204	No would n't make sense because there are people do not need ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY and would just put STYLE in ASPECT_PEOPLE_rainy ASPECT_DAY_FUND .
4321	1204	big corporate ASPECT_LEADERS are n't going to use money to hire people since demand is so low NO does n't warrant hiring people .
4322	1205	My ASPECT_POST was in re : your wholehearted ASPECT_ENDORSEMENT of Communism .
4323	1205	Evidently Liberalism is now Communism for can not spell Communism .
4324	1205	philosophies are .
4325	1205	TAKE from who have , Give to who have not earned .
4326	1205	As far as your ASPECT_POST above and ASPECT_FAR_ATTEMPT to change subject .
4327	1205	can see extremely obvious ASPECT_FACT that B.O. policies have NOT recovered economy even enough for ASPECT_JOB_CREATION to keep up with ASPECT_POPULATION_GROWTH .
4328	1205	Are not foolish .
4329	1205	Unemployment ASPECT_CLAIMS are up again .
4330	1205	There was little ASPECT_DROP for weeks but now DROP on rise again .
4331	1205	AND BLS once again said that rate maintained at 9.5 because ASPECT_ANOTHER_187,000 formerly unemployed , exhausted UNEMPLOYED ASPECT_BENEFITS and ASPECT_DROPPED_OUT of ASPECT_LABOR_MARKET .
4332	1205	Not ASPECT_MY_WORDS , or RNC words or Rush words , comes straight from BLS .
4333	1205	Is economy better ?
4334	1205	Yes ECONOMY is very MARGINALLY better .
4335	1205	obummer and Stimulus ?
4336	1205	No , could be reason for ASPECT_MINUSCULE_IMPROVEMENT .
4337	1205	And trying to claim that NO `` enlightened ASPECT_POLICIES resulted in but invisible ASPECT_IMPROVEMENT IS FOOLISH .
4338	1205	Wonder if Roemer , ASPECT_ROEMER_MAIN_ECONOMIC_adviser ASPECT_QUIT or was FIRED week .
4339	1205	really intelligent ASPECT_PERSON in charge would NOT be trying to take credit for little ASPECT_RESULTS of ASPECT_MASSIVE_SPENDING .
4340	1205	Give ASPECT_OBUMMER_CREDIT for ASPECT_JOBS_PERSON CLAIMS to have `` Created and WONDER works out to over ASPECT_HALF ASPECT_MILLION_DOLLARS per job .
4341	1205	At rate , ROBUST ASPECT_ECONOMY will cost us Quadrillions , ASPECT_NOT Trillions .
4342	1205	Great ASPECT_ECONOMY , impoverished country .
4343	1205	Not ASPECT_GAIN .
4344	1205	and , day by day , population of USA is realizing that obum is completely mired in purely ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_AGENDAS have to do with responsibility of Governing .
4345	1205	DREAMER is incompetent ASPECT_DREAMER or worse .
4346	1206	I think there 's difference , mainly in scale .
4347	1206	Even ASPECT_ADAM_SMITH advocated `` redistributing wealth in form of progressive ASPECT_TAX_STRUCTURE .
4348	1206	ASPECT_FEDERAL_TAX_BRACKET is lowest ASPECT_BRACKET been in decades .
4349	1206	ASPECT_MAIN_IDEA behind Communism , in theory , was to provide ASPECT_ECONOMIC_EQUALITY because of ASPECT_HUGE_AMOUNT of inequality that Marx witnessed .
4350	1206	way to do in existing ASPECT_SYSTEM of government is to not tax lower ASPECT_CLASSES and tax ASPECT_UPPER_class ASPECT_100 , caps on income , etc. .
4351	1206	I do n't see anything like coming from ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION .
4352	1207	Your ASPECT_INABILITY to see obvious is not subject .
4353	1207	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_EQUALITY is oxymoron .
4354	1207	have ability to become wealthy , do not .
4355	1207	We have equality of opportunity .
4356	1207	have opportunity to make attempt at wealth .
4357	1207	ASPECT_WEALTH_CAN_NOT be given to have not and can not earn CAN .
4358	1207	Money can be given to and Trillions have been .
4359	1207	waste CAN one ASPECT_WAY or another .
4360	1207	you take from wealthy , more you damage everyone , including poor .
4361	1207	NO wealthy ASPECT_PERSON has WEALTHY ASPECT_STACK of money locked in vault .
4362	1207	money is always in action in economy .
4363	1207	Invigorating economy and creating jobs , NOT sitting and shrinking from inflation .
4364	1207	IS way ECONOMY can grow .
4365	1207	And benefits poor MORE than giving them dollars to be wasted .
4366	1207	BHO has incredible ASPECT_BLESSING of ASPECT_HISTORICAL_TIMING .
4367	1207	BHO has done of note with ASPECT_BHO_LIFE before or after being elected to ASPECT_POLITICAL_OFFICE , including ASPECT_PRESENT_POSITION .
4368	1207	was do ASPECT_STATE rep. do ASPECT_FEDERAL_SENATOR , and now do -LRB- good -RRB- ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
4369	1207	But came from nowhere in 2008 in ASPECT_POLITICAL_VACUUM .
4370	1207	And now timing blesses A again with unusually low ASPECT_INFLATION .
4371	1207	Notice that no ASPECT_LIB .
4372	1207	is blaming Bush for .
4373	1207	Inflation is very low , artificially low .
4374	1207	If we were running even normal ASPECT_INFLATION_RATES , calls for impeachment would already have been heard .
4375	1207	BO failed ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY does not show up as ASPECT_BAD as they are , due to very low ASPECT_INFLATION .
4376	1207	BHO has had ASPECT_POLITICAL_luck and ASPECT_BLESSING than politician in 100 ASPECT_YEARS .
4377	1207	BHO has no ASPECT_SKILLS for governing , just ASPECT_LUCK .
4378	1207	BHO has wasted bit of LUCK .
4379	1208	And how does of relate to your ASPECT_CLAIM that `` redistribution of wealth and `` From according to ASPECT_FROM_ABILITY , to according to ASPECT_FROM_NEED is ?
4380	1209	I do n't recall endorsing ASPECT_COMMUNISM .
4381	1210	Liberals do n't recognize history .
4382	1210	Everybody knows that .
4383	1211	Again , how is relevant to anything ?
4384	1211	Throwing out ASPECT_RANDOM_BITS of nonsense wo n't get you anywhere .
4385	1212	ASPECT_RANDOM_BITS of nonsense ?
4386	1212	I can not argue with expert in field .
4387	1212	And liberals are experts at ASPECT_RANDOM_BITS of nonsense .
4388	1212	But pendulum is swinging away from utter ASPECT_NONSENSE of liberalism and back to logic of conservatism .
4389	1212	PENDULUM will take years but your ASPECT_DAY in sun is ending .
4390	1212	Once again ASPECT_ACCOMPLISHMENTS will be rewarded and there will be no ASPECT_REWARDS for being parasite on society .
4391	1212	If one accomplishments are meager , so then will rewards be equally meager .
4392	1213	Using fallacious ASPECT_ARGUMENTS over and over and over again would n't exactly ensure that you are above using nonsense , and arrogantly trying to portray that I do as , even though , out of two of us , I 'm one even attempting to further discuss topic at hand .
4393	1213	I 'm terribly sorry that you ca n't manage to support your ASPECT_POSITION , but POSITION no ASPECT_REASON to be unnecessarily antagonistic .
4394	1214	reality of country around us supports my ASPECT_POSITION perfectly and completely negates yours .
4395	1214	MY have no ASPECT_NEED to prove obvious ASPECT_WHILE you have no ASPECT_POSSIBILITY of disproving ridiculousness of liberalism .
4396	1214	NEED is what ASPECT_NEED is .
4397	1214	Liberals have had LIBERALS run most all of ASPECT_20TH_CENTURY .
4398	1214	RUN did n't work .
4399	1214	Your ASPECT_TIME is gone .
4400	1214	transition will take ASPECT_BIT_but ASPECT_TRANSITION is time for liberals to fade into background .
4401	1214	Sadly at time in future , pendulum will swing back your ASPECT_WAY .
4402	1214	MY 'll be gone .
4404	1215	You 've been watching Faux ASPECT_NEWS too long .
4405	1216	Conservatives keep rewriting history , everybody knows that .
4406	1217	Sigh , shifting wealth ... again , how is correct , responsible , and ASPECT_ETHICAL ?
4407	1217	Oh wait SIGH not .
4408	1217	You are TAKING from one to give to another did .
4409	1218	Yeah like Clinton mythical Budget ASPECT_SURPLUS that Democrat never fails to mention .
4410	1218	What they do not mention is that ASPECT_CLINTON_COOPERATED with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS to come close to balancing budget .
4411	1218	And in no fiscal ASPECT_YEAR of Clinton Presidency did ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT come down .
4412	1218	went up year !
4413	1218	Altho in small ASPECT_AMOUNTS that we would love to have today .
4414	1218	But spending was NEVER so controlled that interest on debt did not cause debt to increase .
4415	1218	Interest IS part of problem and must be counted same as reckless ASPECT_SPENDING .
4416	1218	But again kudos to Clinton and Republicans for as well as they did .
4417	1218	We could use that cooperation ASPECT_TODAY .
4418	1218	Just one small ASPECT_EXAMPLE of true ASPECT_HISTORY that ASPECT_DEMS_and ASPECT_LIBS seem to get wrong constantly .
4419	1219	You 're being charged to live in one of greatest ASPECT_COUNTRIES in America .
4420	1219	ONE way to pay for freedom 's fair .
4421	1220	And how much are Takers being charged and by whom .
4422	1220	HALF of `` greatest ASPECT_COUNTRY_GETS while ASPECT_HALF_GIVES .
4423	1220	And you profess is Right ???
4424	1221	Part of living in great ASPECT_COUNTRY means if proper ASPECT_CHANNELS are filed no one should ever starve in country .
4425	1221	You might be giving right now .
4426	1221	But if God forbid you fall into situation where you ca n't afford food longer you will be thankful to be in country where you can get ASPECT_TAX_ASSISTANCE as well .
4427	1221	I 'm sorry you 'd rather live in country where we allow people to starve because of ASPECT_PEOPLE_financial ASPECT_SITUATION .
4428	1221	But thankfully ASPECT_WE are land of freedom .
4429	1221	Not greed .
4430	1222	As always liberal ASPECT_UTOPIAN_DREAMS sound beautiful , but they DO NOT stand up to reality .
4431	1222	HALF country ARE parasites living ASPECT_QUITE_WELL off half are responsible hard ASPECT_WORKING_CITIZENS .
4432	1222	And of half are parasites , LESS ASPECT_THAN_10 ASPECT_&#37;_APPROACH_ANYTHING could be called poverty .
4433	1222	And ASPECT_TINY_PERCENTAGE_EVER go to bed HUNGRY .
4434	1222	are over nourished on junk ASPECT_FOOD_and grossly ASPECT_FAT !
4435	1222	Starving is nearly NON-EXISTENT in country .
4436	1222	Freeloading is ASPECT_LIFE_CAREER for half country .
4437	1222	, is reason I object .
4439	1223	So you being on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS or ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD -LRB- I forget which ASPECT_ONE you are on -RRB- , while I work 2 ASPECT_JOBS to pay for I college , etc. .
4441	1223	is ok , while you do n't have job .
4442	1223	How is fair again ?
4443	1224	It 's fair because A. I 'm probably in ASPECT_LOT_DEBT .
4444	1224	And B. You can probably afford things .
4445	1224	And C. If ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD did n't exist I can all but guarantee you would not have your 2 ASPECT_JOBS right now in economy .
4446	1224	And if you did C. would be for ASPECT_LOT_less ASPECT_MONEY .
4447	1224	And ASPECT_D._EVEN working 2 ASPECT_JOBS could get ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD if they wanted to and ASPECT_THEY make less than ASPECT_REQUIRED_MONEY .
4448	1224	I suggest you stop whining and apply .
4449	1224	D. 'll make your ASPECT_LIFE easier and D. will benefit economy .
4450	1224	I roommate has 3 ASPECT_JOBS and 's not enough for ROOMMATE to be able to afford rent because ROOMMATE also cares for ASPECT_ROOMMATE_PARENTS .
4451	1224	ROOMMATE qualify for ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS as well .
4452	1224	Here you can do 3 ASPECT_ONLINE !
4454	1225	1 -RRB- Said he was against ASPECT_MIDDLE_EASTERN_WAR , said that HE would start pulling troops out at beginning , instead HE sent than bush ASPECT_DID -LRB- ASPECT_FACT_-RRB- .
4455	1225	HE said HE was against Patriot ASPECT_ACT but voted for ASPECT_ACT_.2 -RRB- In ASPECT_HE_HEALTHCARE_BILL , HE used ASPECT_BACKDOOR_MEETINGS to secure votes by unions etc. .
4456	1225	bill ACT was changed ASPECT_MULTIPLE_TIMES before republicans could properly read BILL , and democrats as well .3 -RRB- Is going to let Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS expire , which is going to increase taxes .
4457	1225	BUSH ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION has announced ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES due to ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_BILL , and for everyone .
4458	1225	REPUBLICANS are purposing to add ASPECT_VAT_TAX_WHILE not eliminating others -LRB- increase of taxes -RRB- .4 -RRB- BUSH has spent money in 2 ASPECT_YEARS than bush did in 8.5 -RRB- Used BUSH position of BUSH ASPECT_POLITICL_PARTY to strong ASPECT_ARM_OBAMA_CARE through before ASPECT_CONGRESS had even read INCREASE , before of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE had read INCREASE and despite strong ASPECT_RESISTANCE from country .6 -RRB- Instead of supporting country sovereignty , BUSH choses to sue state takes matters that ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT is obligated to do as ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT .
4460	1225	Bottom ASPECT_LINE , there is WAY better out there , LINE doesnt matter if ASPECT_LINE_2 ASPECT_YEARS in , there is ASPECT_WAY_BETTER .
4461	1228	So how is your ASPECT_DECISION to make debt for yourself defense ?
4462	1229	You think CHOICE my ASPECT_CHOICE to be in debt ?
4463	1229	If MY could handle 2 ASPECT_JOBS and college ASPECT_MY would .
4464	1229	But MY ca n't .
4465	1229	Kudos to can .
4466	1229	But MY ca n't .
4467	1229	School has never been easy for MY .
4468	1229	And ASPECT_MY_GRADES_DROP to unacceptable ASPECT_LEVELS when MY have work .
4469	1229	's why MY work ASPECT_SUMMER_JOBS .
4470	1229	His ASPECT_ABILITY to work 2 ASPECT_JOBS while going to school is great .
4471	1229	HIS will see greater financial ASPECT_REWARDS than MY will as result .
4472	1229	's what is fair about RESULT .
4473	1229	HIS hard ASPECT_WORK pays off in end .
4474	1229	Where as MY will have to work harder later to pay off ASPECT_MY_DEBTS .
4475	1229	But HIS would rather MY choice be between starving or flunking school .
4477	1229	MY am glad ASPECT_COUNTRY is not greedy ASPECT_CESSPOOL_COUNTRY HIS wants COUNTRY to be .
4478	1229	MY 'm glad have freedom to go to school without worrying too about financial ASPECT_NEEDS .
4479	1230	Are you incapable of thinking in ASPECT_TERM ?
4480	1231	banks were bailed out before BUSH was elected .
4481	1231	was Bush .
4482	1231	And you better thank your lucky ASPECT_STARS_BUSH did .
4483	1231	Or we 'd be in depression .
4484	1232	He said HE was against ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR .
4485	1232	HE has shrunk of troops in Iraq .
4486	1232	HE said HE was for ASPECT_AFGHAN_WAR .
4487	1232	HE has increased amount of troops in Afghanistan and ASPECT_PAKISTAN .
4488	1232	HE has done with ASPECT_TROOP_LEVELS contradicts what HE campaigned on .
4489	1232	ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_BILL was passed through perfectly legal ASPECT_PASSAGES .
4490	1232	And unions did not vote on issue .
4491	1232	ASPECT_PEOPLES_TAXES have gone down .
4492	1232	's fact .
4493	1232	ASPECT_LOL_NOT at true .
4494	1232	ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_BILL was in congress for than 8 ASPECT_MONTHS .
4495	1232	If your ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_LEADERS ca n't read bill in 8 ASPECT_MONTHS you really have to wonder why LEADERS are your ASPECT_LEADERS .
4496	1232	LEADERS crossed line of LEADERS constitutional ASPECT_POWERS as state .
4497	1232	LEADERS deserve ASPECT_LAW_SUIT against LEADERS .
4499	1235	Are you incapable for comprehending question ?
4500	1235	point is that if POINT is not to be started in 2014 , why does POINT need to be passed in 2010 ?
4501	1235	If POINT for purpose of collecting taxes for 4 ASPECT_YEARS to kick start benefits in 2014 then POINT completely flawed ASPECT_IDEA .
4502	1235	Give ASPECT_TAX_MONEY for 4 ASPECT_YEARS , so YEARS will build up , so they can provide you ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE ?
4503	1235	uneducated ASPECT_PEOPLE will understand .
4504	1236	How does contradict what or ASPECT_OBAMA said .
4505	1236	Obama campaigned on increasing troops on Afghanistan .
4506	1236	It was one of his ASPECT_CAMPAIGN promises to increase troops in Afghanistan .
4507	1236	ASPECT_LABOR_UNIONS did not vote for bill .
4508	1236	Congressmen and ASPECT_WOMEN did .
4509	1236	Your ASPECT_SOURCE is ASPECT_OPINION_PIECE that right from get go states PIECE bias against liberal ASPECT_POLITICIANS .
4510	1236	Which apparently ASPECT_POLITICIANS think Obama is ... even though ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICIES are pretty far from liberal .
4512	1236	Bush spent in 8 ASPECT_YEARS than Obama spent in 2 .
4513	1236	was your ASPECT_CLAIM .
4514	1236	HUNDREDS are STILL ASPECT_SPENDING_HUNDREDS of billions in unjustified and unnecessary ASPECT_WAR in Iraq that Bush started .
4515	1236	Obama has no ASPECT_POWER to do .
4516	1236	Please read ASPECT_BASIC_CIVICS_BOOK and learn powers of branches of government before complaining about what Obama did .
4517	1236	Your `` ASPECT_RESEARCH is but ASPECT_OPINION_ARTICLES that fit your ASPECT_VIEW of world .
4518	1236	do n't think you understand what ASPECT_RESEARCH is .
4519	1236	Research is raw ASPECT_NUMBERS_and ASPECT_DATA .
4520	1236	saw no budget ASPECT_CHARTS .
4521	1236	saw no ASPECT_EVIDENCE to back of your ASPECT_CLAIMS .
4522	1236	you provided is that there is on internet agrees with you .
4523	1236	Not ASPECT_DIFFICULT to do .
4524	1237	I have 3 ASPECT_SAUDI-ARABIAN_EXCHANGE_STUDENTS that ASPECT_LIVE_DOOR to I .
4525	1237	I am good ASPECT_FRIENDS with STUDENTS .
4526	1237	ASPECT_FRIENDS_GOVERNMENT gives ASPECT_FRIENDS_PLENTY of money since FRIENDS ASPECT_GOVERNMENT actually values education unlike ours .
4527	1237	FRIENDS can live very comfortably without working .
4528	1237	If FRIENDS do n't put up grades , FRIENDS get sent back home .
4529	1237	ASPECT_FRIENDS_SYSTEM of education works much better than OURS .
4530	1237	Do n't talk to I about going to college without having to worry to about financial ASPECT_NEEDS .
4531	1237	Hell yes I am worried about money while in college and you should be too .
4532	1237	's why I am working 2 ASPECT_JOBS and transferring to ASPECT_LOCAL_UNIVERSITY , so I can save money .
4533	1237	Maybe you should consider .
4534	1237	Also , both I ASPECT_JOBS would be there if HELL was n't for criminal ASPECT_REDISTRIBUTION of wealth by ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS\/BRIDGE_PROGRAMS .
4535	1237	Bottom ASPECT_LINE , YOU country does next to to ASPECT_VALUE_EDUCATION .
4536	1237	's why LINE outrageously expensive .
4537	1237	You ca n't get -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- for loans unless your ASPECT_PARENTS are poor or MINORITY are minority .
4538	1238	agreed angry ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES whining about working hard , pick fruit from obamas ASPECT_TREE and settle down .
4539	1238	FRUIT helps economy and makes life easier
4540	1239	Everyone qualifies for ASPECT_OBAMAS_assistance including ASPECT_WHITES , maybe if conservatives research WHITES will be better able to get educated .
4541	1239	Recent ASPECT_DATA shows students going to college are on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS and type of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE , with low ASPECT_INCOME qualifies for COLLEGE .
4542	1239	Vote for ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_DEMOCRATS to help yourselves .
4543	1240	Obama just took over college ASPECT_LOAN_SYSTEM to pay for ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE , which means government will no longer have competition for loans .
4544	1240	Which means stupidly ASPECT_HIGH_RATE_LOANS to take out .
4545	1240	ASPECT_MIDDLE_class ASPECT_WHITES receive other than -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_UN-SUBSIDIZED_LOANS .
4546	1240	I doubt you know what is though .
4547	1240	Also , where is recent ASPECT_DATA shows ?
4548	1240	I 'm in college , people are not on ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE other than loans .
4549	1240	I will never vote for Obama either .
4550	1241	I work hard .
4551	1241	people whining are people taking ASPECT_MY_MONEY .
4552	1241	Do n't bite hand feeds .
4553	1241	Of course YOU would criticize people for working hard .
4554	1241	YOU would tell I to not work hard and let government provide for I .
4555	1241	People not working helps economy ?!
4556	1241	You got one right ... makes your ASPECT_LIFE easier .
4557	1241	I am just in awe at how lazy ASPECT_PEOPLE are .
4558	1241	I 'm not going to work so I will just let taxpayers pay for I ASPECT_MEALS .
4559	1242	ASPECT_MIDDLE_class ASPECT_WHITES do n't need ASPECT_TAXPAYER_LOANS , WHITES live with ASPECT_WHITES_PARENTS .
4560	1242	ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_LOANS are given to ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_STUDENTS who make WHITES way , are people that ASPECT_NEED_EXTRA_HELP with ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS and ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE .
4561	1243	ASPECT_BRIDGE_PROGRAM allows for working poor ASPECT_PEOPLE to get ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS_and ASPECT_ASSISTANCE because PEOPLE do n't live with ASPECT_PEOPLE_PARENTS and actually have rent to pay along with ASPECT_PEOPLE_EXPENSES .
4562	1244	Go ahead and try to support premise .
4565	1245	Where does obama get money ?
4566	1246	Is ASPECT_CLUSTERED_PACKAGE of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_IDEAS better than ASPECT_CLUSTERED_PACKAGE of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_IDEAS ?
4567	1246	Not if one of ideas includes ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS to rich ...
4568	1247	Generally ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_LOANS are cheaper ASPECT_RATES because they are partially paid for by ASPECT_TAX_PAYERS .
4569	1247	YOU consider YOU ASPECT_FAMILY_MIDDLE_CLASS .
4570	1247	YOU parents make about ASPECT_40-50K_YEAR .
4571	1247	YOU got tons of subsidized ASPECT_LOANS .
4572	1247	YOU think you 'd be surprised .
4573	1247	4 of YOU ASPECT_ROOM_MATES are on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS .
4574	1247	members of YOU apartment ASPECT_COMPLEX YOU 've spoken to are on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS .
4575	1247	And quite of YOU friends are as well .
4576	1247	And YOU 've been nudging people to get ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS as well .
4577	1247	COMPLEX just makes things easier .
4578	1247	Even you ... with 2 ASPECT_JOBS ... could qualify for ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS .
4579	1247	If you make less than ASPECT_1000 month then chances are you qualify for ASPECT_FULL_BENEFIT of 200 month .
4580	1247	Which is more than enough to eat and eat healthy .
4581	1247	YOU highly suggest you take opportunity to sign up .
4582	1247	Think of OPPORTUNITY as taking of your ASPECT_TAX_MONEY back .
4584	1248	Newsflah : We 're still in recession .
4585	1249	Dems were incapable of reading apparently .
4586	1250	It is amazing that you know ASPECT_SO_LITTLE about ASPECT_UNITED_STATES that you could type above and believe of TYPE is good .
4587	1250	true ASPECT_AMERICAN understands how America MUST ASPECT_FUNCTION_KNOWS that one must try to fix themselves AND try to help THEMSELVES ASPECT_COUNTRY , NOT way around .
4588	1250	Your ASPECT_WAY MUST FAIL .
4589	1250	ASPECT_THR_right ASPECT_WAY was clearly stated by Democrat .
4591	1250	JFK said , `` Ask NOT what your ASPECT_COUNTRY can do for YOUR , ASK what YOUR can do for ASPECT_YOUR_COUNTRY !
4592	1250	`` Instead of recommending others to ALSO become ASPECT_FREELOADERS , LOSER should be condemning idea of taking anything from Government unless LOSER ASPECT_NEED is dire .
4593	1250	And needing ASPECT_ANOTHER_color ASPECT_TV and ASPECT_HIGH_SPEED_INTERNET_CONNECTION are ASPECT_NOT_dire ASPECT_NEEDS for person on planet .
4594	1250	Not ASPECT_ONE .
4595	1250	country and economy are only benefited when of us contribute .
4596	1250	2 ASPECT_PEOPLE spending one ASPECT_PERSON ASPECT_MONEY_DOES NOT put ASPECT_SINGLE_PENNY more into economy .
4597	1250	It just means hard ASPECT_WORKER has less and freeloader has more .
4598	1250	When JFK went to college ASPECT_JFK was married , had 2 ASPECT_BABY_SONS , worked ASPECT_FULL_TIME_JOB , and carried ASPECT_FULL_LOAD of credits , and still found time to do ASPECT_FRIDAY_beer ASPECT_NIGHT with ASPECT_FRAT_BROTHERS twice ASPECT_MONTH .
4599	1250	Where energy came from JFK do n't remember -LRB- wish JFK had ASPECT_ENERGY_NOW -RRB- .
4600	1250	Grades were good , not spectacular but ASPECT_GOOD .
4601	1250	No ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS , no ASPECT_WELFARE , no ASPECT_HELP from anywhere including parents .
4602	1250	Who would have been happy to help , but what were doing was what chose to do and if could not do HELP on , HELP was on .
4603	1250	JFK would have been ASHAMED to even think about ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_MONEY .
4604	1250	Taking ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_MONEY means that LOSER are loser and parasite on society .
4605	1250	!
4606	1251	No ASPECT_WE are n't
4607	1252	Sure we are .
4608	1252	ASPECT_WIKIPEDIAIN_ECONOMICS , recession is ASPECT_BUSINESS_cycle ASPECT_CONTRACTION , ASPECT_GENERAL_SLOWDOWN in ASPECT_ECONOMIC_ACTIVITY over period of time .
4609	1252	-LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- During recessions , ASPECT_MACROECONOMIC_INDICATORS vary in ASPECT_SIMILAR_WAY .
4610	1252	Production as measured by Gross ASPECT_DOMESTIC_PRODUCT -LRB- ASPECT_GDP_-RRB- , ASPECT_EMPLOYMENT_, ASPECT_INVESTMENT_SPENDING , ASPECT_CAPACITY_UTILIZATION , ASPECT_HOUSEHOLD_INCOMES , ASPECT_BUSINESS_PROFITS and inflation fall during recessions ; while bankruptcies and unemployment ASPECT_RATE_RISE .
4611	1252	Recessions are generally believed to be caused by ASPECT_WIDESPREAD_DROP in spending .
4612	1252	Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting ASPECT_EXPANSIONARY_MACROECONOMIC_POLICIES , such as increasing ASPECT_MONEY_SUPPLY , increasing ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING and decreasing taxation .
4613	1252	and DOWNTURN could be truthfully argued that we 're in depression : ASPECT_WIKIPEDIADEPRESSIONIN_ECONOMICS , depression is sustained , ASPECT_LONG-TERM_DOWNTURN in ASPECT_ECONOMIC_ACTIVITY in one or ASPECT_ECONOMIES .
4614	1252	DOWNTURN is severe ASPECT_DOWNTURN than recession , which is seen by economists as part of normal ASPECT_BUSINESS_CYCLE .
4615	1252	Considered ASPECT_RARE_and ASPECT_EXTREME_FORM of recession , depression is characterized by ASPECT_FORM_LENGTH , and by abnormally ASPECT_INCREASES in unemployment , falls in availability of credit quite often due to kind of ASPECT_BANKING\/FINANCIAL_CRISIS , shrinking ASPECT_OUTPUT_and ASPECT_INVESTMENT , ASPECT_NUMEROUS_BANKRUPTCIES including ASPECT_SOVEREIGN_debt ASPECT_DEFAULTS , significantly reduced amounts of ASPECT_TRADE_and ASPECT_COMMERCE especially international , as well as highly volatile ASPECT_RELATIVE_currency ASPECT_VALUE_FLUCTUATIONS most often due to devaluations .
4616	1252	ASPECT_PRICE_DEFLATION , financial ASPECT_CRISES and ASPECT_BANK_FAILURES are also ASPECT_COMMON_ELEMENTS of depression .
4617	1252	Of course government will tell you that everything is great and we 're doing just fine and ASPECT_INDICATORS show that WE 're pulling out of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AND of measures have worked and ... blah ASPECT_BLAH ... etc. .
4619	1252	lies ... etc. .
4620	1253	Wikipedia is not good ASPECT_SOURCE .

4637	1254	. deception .
4639	1254	. 's like saying if we had n't given away 700 billion ASPECT_DOLLARS economy would REALLY be bad right now .

4641	1254	... hahahah .
4645	1254	What ASPECT_PARTS of definitions of `` depression and `` recession are wrong ?

4656	1255	`` ASPECT_ADVERTISED_RATE of unemployment of 9.5 ASPECT_&#37; and rate closer to 20 !
4657	1256	You 've got it wrong .
4658	1256	It is good that you work hard , and you should expect government to recognize that , instead of taking your ASPECT_MONEY and giving MONEY to very ASPECT_WEALTHY , who do n't work at .
4659	1256	GOVERNMENT is known as corporate ASPECT_WELFARE , and amount of welfare spent on poor is drop in bucket compared to amount spent on wealthy .
4660	1256	Yet GOP has ASPECT_CONVINCED_GOP_MEMBERS that poor ASPECT_PEOPLE suck money out of government .
4661	1256	Corporate welfare-the ASPECT_ENORMOUS_and myriad ASPECT_SUBSIDIES , bailouts , giveaways , ASPECT_TAX_LOOPHOLES , debt ASPECT_REVOCATIONS , ASPECT_LOAN_GUARANTEES , discounted ASPECT_INSURANCE and benefits conferred by government on business-is function of ASPECT_POLITICAL_CORRUPTION .
4662	1256	Corporate welfare ASPECT_PROGRAMS siphon funds from appropriate ASPECT_PUBLIC_INVESTMENTS , subsidize companies ripping minerals from ASPECT_FEDERAL_LANDS , enable ASPECT_PHARMACEUTICAL_COMPANIES to gouge consumers , perpetuate ASPECT_ANTI-COMPETITIVE_OLIGOPOLISTIC_MARKETS , injure ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY , and weaken democracy .
4663	1256	At time when ASPECT_NATIONAL_GDP is soaring , one in five children ASPECT_LIVES in ASPECT_DEEP_POVERTY , one might expect that ASPECT_PUBLIC_EFFORT to curtail welfare would focus on cutting big ASPECT_HANDOUTS to rich ASPECT_CORPORATIONS , not small ASPECT_SUPPORTS for poor ASPECT_INDIVIDUALS .
4664	1256	But invocations of need for ASPECT_STAND-ON-YOUR-OWN-TWO-FEET_RESPONSIBILITY do not apply to corporations .
4665	1256	At time when even growing ASPECT_FEDERAL_budget ASPECT_SURPLUSES do not persuade nation ASPECT_POLITICAL_LEADERS to devote ASPECT_PUBLIC_RESOURCES to repairing and enhancing built ASPECT_ELEMENTS of commonwealth-such as nation ASPECT_SCHOOLS_, ASPECT_BRIDGES_, ASPECT_CLINICS_, roads ASPECT_, drinking ASPECT_WATER_SYSTEMS , courthouses , ASPECT_PUBLIC_TRANSPORTATION_SYSTEMS , and ASPECT_WATER_TREATMENT_FACILITIES-ONE might expect to see calls to divert ASPECT_TAXPAYER_MONIES from flowing into ASPECT_PRIVATE_corporate ASPECT_HANDS and instead ASPECT_DIRECT_LEADERS to crying ASPECT_PUBLIC_NEEDS .
4666	1256	But somehow cramped ASPECT_FEDERAL_BUDGET-AS well as similarly situated ASPECT_STATE_and ASPECT_LOCAL_BUDGETS-ALWAYS has room for another corporate welfare ASPECT_PROGRAM .

4668	1256	Even that work and ASPECT_CLAIM_PEOPLE_WORK hard .

4672	1256	recession does n't play favorites .
4673	1256	But to ignore poor ASPECT_PEOPLE while allowing corporations -LRB- who pay ASPECT_PEOPLE_CEO big ASPECT_BONUSES -RRB- , to continue and take advantage of Americans is just plain wrong .
4674	1257	And by definition we are NOT in recession .

4717	1270	I mean , I guess is n't best ASPECT_PLACE for PLACE , but PLACE late , I 'm little depressed , and I feel like finally telling you what I think .
4718	1270	Your ASPECT_ARGUMENTS are ignorant and fallacious , you never listen to logic , I mean , assuming you are n't conservative trying to make liberals look bad , PERSON are possibly ignorant ASPECT_PERSON I have ever seen !
4719	1270	You are completely close minded , and it seems almost unreal that you can post over 3,000 ASPECT_POSTS on forum and your ASPECT_MIND still be closed ASPECT_SHELL !
4720	1270	Your seeming ASPECT_UTOPIA of world is incredibly flawed , and I think ASPECT_DEEP_INSIDE , you know UTOPIA .
4721	1270	-LRB- is still assuming you are n't posing as liberal ASPECT_-RRB- .
4722	1270	I am sorry , but YOU ARE WRONG !
4723	1270	I am not suprised that you are just into your ASPECT_2ND_BAR of ASPECT_REP._\/_RANTSORRY_MODS , I just had to get off I chest .

4725	1270	I 'm going to bed .
4726	1271	why was thread closed for ASPECT_TROLLING_OP ?
4727	1272	Way to reply and deflect .
4728	1273	Its ASPECT_APPARENTLY not open to people who have n't made up minds .
4729	1274	right because no ASPECT_ONE changes minds in two ASPECT_YEARS , or even ASPECT_CARES who ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE is .
4730	1274	THEY just make up THEY minds before hand and never change of THEY ASPECT_OPINIONS ... THEY also do not know how to not have opinion and THEY know who THEY will vote for 2 ASPECT_YEARS in advance .
4731	1274	After 2 ASPECT_YEARS mean anyway right ?
4732	1274	, ASPECT_THEY_`` ASPECT_CHANGE , nor do THEY have `` ASPECT_HOPE of anything new and good ASPECT_HAPPENING .
4733	1274	Everything is just doomed to stay as is .
4734	1274	There is no ASPECT_WAY_anything good or ASPECT_BAD could happen would change THEY ASPECT_OPINIONS .
4735	1274	Uncertainty is not option , maybe is not option .
4736	1274	Either you sell two ASPECT_YEARS short and give up and -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- guy or you praise GUY and buy into what hes saying .
4737	1274	Either ASPECT_WAY poll fails as WAY usually not smart to be dead ASPECT_SET on who your going to vote for till at least both ASPECT_CANDIDATES are announced , and of term is over .
4738	1277	Sure it is .
4739	1277	IT will be here when you make up your ASPECT_MIND .
4740	1278	... or , eight ASPECT_YEARS of Obama may plunge us into depths of Hell .
4741	1279	Possibly , but we wo n't see effects of of ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION_POLICIES for years , and I 'd like to see how stimulus , change of ASPECT_WAR_FOCUS , bailouts , financial and ASPECT_HEALTH_reform ASPECT_PLAY out before changing horses in midstream .
4742	1279	WE had eight ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_YEARS and witnessed how things turned out , let give Democrats eight and compare .
4743	1280	folks who dissect Obama policies see bad ASPECT_THINGS happening .
4744	1280	is why FOLKS want to change course - Administrations .
4745	1280	Throwing and ASPECT_TAXPAYER_MONEY at problems will not make FOLKS go away .
4746	1280	I 'm afraid we can not afford another ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM .
4747	1281	Let not and say did , OK ??
4748	1281	had forty ASPECT_YEARS straight of Democrat ASPECT_RULE started whole ASPECT_PILE of sh in place !
4749	1282	Who told you that ?
4750	1282	Prior to Obama , we have had ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_ADMINISTRATIONS for 20 out of ASPECT_PAST_28 ASPECT_YEARS and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONTROL of Congress for 14 of ASPECT_PREVIOUS_16 .
4751	1283	Whoever sits in ASPECT_OVAL_OFFICE_SIGNS or does n't sign laws that Congress -LRB- ASPECT_LAWMAKING_BODY_-RRB- passes .
4752	1283	If President will not sign bill , Congress has power to pass BILL anyway if they get enough ASPECT_MEMBERS to vote to override veto .
4753	1283	Now that you know or have been reminded of , Democrats HAVE BEEN in power for 4 ASPECT_YEARS .
4754	1283	Democrat controlled Congress passed TARP , and Stimulus , and obummercare , and Financial ASPECT_REGULATION_REFORM , and recent 26 Billion ASPECT_BAILOUT of states wasted money .
4755	1283	In 4 ASPECT_YEARS THEY have jacked up ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT about 4,000,000,000,000.00 -LRB- 4 ASPECT_TRILLION -RRB- So is what THEY 've done in 4 of 8 ASPECT_YEARS you want THEY to have .
4756	1284	To override veto to pass law anyway requires 2\/3 ASPECT_VOTE in both ASPECT_HOUSES of Congress .
4757	1284	Now that you know or have been reminded of , Democrats HAVE ASPECT_NOT_HAD 2\/3 ASPECT_MAJORITY in of 4 ASPECT_YEARS .
4758	1284	Therefore , ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CONGRESS could not pass laws that Republicans opposed to address things like ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT that you conservatives are suddenly so concerned about .
4759	1284	Where were you ASPECT_GUYS in 2001 while Bush ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION was squandering surplus with ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
4760	1284	Supporting ASPECT_DEFICITS then .
4761	1286	You need to research where Government actually gets ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INCOME_TAX_REVENUE and stop reciting big liberal ASPECT_LIE .
4762	1286	rich will ALWAYS get richer .
4763	1286	's how they got rich in place .
4764	1286	Do n't worry about rich getting more .
4765	1286	What THEY get THEY keep in play to make .
4766	1286	ASPECT_TAX_CUT for lower ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS does .
4767	1286	THEY do n't pay ASPECT_INCOME_TAXES now .
4768	1286	80 0 = ASPECT_0 .
4769	1286	Give THEY 50 ASPECT_TAX_CUT .
4770	1286	50 0 = ASPECT_0 .
4771	1286	Rounded off ASPECT_NUMBERS : top ASPECT_20 in income presently pays 85 of ASPECT_INCOME_TAX .
4772	1286	30 in income pay remaining ASPECT_15 bottom ASPECT_50 in income do not pay ASPECT_INCOME_TAXES .
4773	1287	Raise top ASPECT_INCOME_TAX_LEVEL to about ASPECT_50 .
4774	1287	Close out loopholes .
4775	1287	Cut ASPECT_PAYROLL taxes 50 .
4776	1287	reduces taxes lower ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASSES_PAY and addresses your ASPECT_CONCERNS .
4777	1289	Do and what you get from rich will be not ASPECT_SINGLE_PENNY more .
4778	1289	Does spending 250,000.00 on ASPECT_TAX_LAWYER to save million ASPECT_DOLLARS on ASPECT_TAXES_SOUND like smart ASPECT_BUSINESS_MOVE to you ?
4779	1289	Well is what will happen .
4780	1289	Then you have working ASPECT_RICH .
4781	1289	CREATORS are ASPECT_JOB_CREATORS .
4782	1289	ASPECT_RAISE_CREATORS_TAXES and one of 2 ASPECT_THINGS_HAPPEN or both .
4783	1289	One , CREATORS lay off people or raise prices that ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS has to pay for ASPECT_CREATORS_PRODUCTS_or ASPECT_SERVICES , -- ASPECT_OR_BOTH .
4784	1289	Net to Govt .
4785	1289	LESS , net to ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS , higher ASPECT_PRICES , fewer ASPECT_JOBS .
4786	1289	And rich , vested or ASPECT_WORKING , are pound for pound about 5 or 6 times ASPECT_SMARTER than politicians .
4787	1289	POLITICIANS win , 's how world works , like WORLD or not .
4788	1289	action has ASPECT_EQUAL_and ASPECT_OPPOSITE_REACTION .
4789	1289	State after state HAS raised taxes and netted much , less ASPECT_STATE_INCOME , unemployment , and higher ASPECT_PRICES .
4790	1289	No ASPECT_EXAMPLE is better than ASPECT_NEW_YORK .
4791	1289	city and state .
4792	1289	liberal ASPECT_ANSWER is always raise taxes on rich and reality is that REALITY does NOT produce of desired ASPECT_RESULTS .
4793	1289	And when one keeps doing over and over and expecting different ASPECT_RESULTS , is called what ?
4794	1290	ASPECT_REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES_PRAY for night !
4796	1290	ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA ratings are out of step with ASPECT_OBAMA_achievementsA ASPECT_QUICK_RECOLLECTION of recent ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_GOVERNANCE should make voters think twice about handing Congress back to themAnd yet , we come back to great ASPECT_PARADOX of moment .
4797	1290	reforms Democrats enact , less happy ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_VOTERS who , presumably , voted for Democrats because VOTERS wanted many of reforms enacted are .
4798	1290	If discontent produces sort of `` enthusiasm ASPECT_GAP at elections hinted at in recent ASPECT_POLLS , November could indeed see significant ASPECT_GAINS for GOP .
4799	1290	said , my ASPECT_GUESS is gains wo n't be quite as large as pundits think , that ASPECT_MUCH-ANTICIPATED_ROUT wo n't actually occur .
4800	1290	There are signs , in recent ASPECT_POLLS , that as election nears and people start paying attention to debates , voters are starting to return to Democrats .
4801	1290	PEOPLE might detest incumbents , and , for variety of reasons , PEOPLE may feel increasingly disillusioned with ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION , but when push comes to shove voters also are n't convinced by ASPECT_GOP_MESSAGE .
4802	1290	Predictions are always dangerous ASPECT_GAME in politics , but at point MY guess is that Democrats will cling on to power , with significantly reduced ASPECT_MAJORITIES , in both ASPECT_HOUSES of Congress .
4804	1291	It 's difficult to judge with ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY is to blame for mounting ASPECT_DEBT , as we keep voting in different ASPECT_PARTIES to ASPECT_PRESIDENCY_and ASPECT_CONGRESS like yo-yo .
4805	1291	WE 've got ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PRESIDENT_and ASPECT_DEMOCRATICALLY-CONTROLLED_CONGRESS .
4806	1291	Give ASPECT_WE_70 ASPECT_+_MEMBERS in Senate November so WE can see what happens without ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_OBSTRUCTION .
4807	1291	I speculate planets will align and WE 'll have ASPECT_NEW_CAR from Opera under ASPECT_WE_CHAIRS .
4808	1293	Hell no !
4809	1293	like asking me if ME want ASPECT_UNITED_STATES to fail ... Jollee

4812	1294	Not if my ASPECT_LIFE depended on LIFE !
4815	1296	WE DONT CARE what world thinks about us .
4816	1296	US care about OURSELVES .
4817	1296	He cares more about what you think being from ASPECT_NEW_ZEALAND than what I care about being from America .
4818	1297	If you lived here and understood how his ASPECT_POLICIES are affecting economy you may have different ASPECT_OPINION ... BigBob
4819	1298	Yes , yes .
4820	1298	We know you do n't care .
4821	1298	ARGUMENT is your ASPECT_ARGUMENT for just about ASPECT_EVERYTHING except your silly ASPECT_WARS .
4822	1298	But you might have to care that Obama wants to engage with world .
4823	1298	After , WORLD will affect your your ASPECT_ABILITY not to care .
4824	1299	IDEA might be good ASPECT_IDEA to concern yourself with your ASPECT_TERRITORY , since you do not live here ... Instead of living vicariously through America ... Big ASPECT_BOB
4825	1300	We are ASPECT_UNITED_STATES of America , Is ASPECT_STATES_WE_JOB to worry about your ASPECT_ECONOMY ?
4826	1300	WE do alot of humanitarian ASPECT_ASSISTANCE for countries , what does your ASPECT_COUNTRY do ... WE cant give you everything , WE have to look out for ASPECT_WE_DIVERSE_NATION of States ...

4827	1301	Well done .
4828	1301	In your ASPECT_EYES .
4829	1302	And eyes of ... .
4832	1303	Fighting against type of thinking is one of reasons I 'll vote for Obama .
4833	1304	ASPECT_GOD_Bless ASPECT_AMERICA !
4834	1304	That you have ability to ASPECT_VOICE_and ASPECT_ACT upon your ASPECT_PREROGATIVES ... Unfortunately for you , your ASPECT_IDEALS are in minority ... Jollee
4835	1305	God bless world !
4836	1305	Oh ... wait .
4837	1306	Yes , I agree , I wish them well ... Jollee
4838	1307	Who do you care about , America ... or world ?
4839	1307	Obama cares more about world .
4840	1307	is problem .
4841	1307	OBAMA would rather have people in ASPECT_KENYA_HAPPY than people in America ASPECT_HAPPY .
4842	1307	God bless America !
4843	1308	I care about America mostly , because of world has indifference to ASPECT_FREEDOM that we so embrace here in country ... I care about world , but WORLD is Dictators , ASPECT_POLITICAL_SET-UPS , etc. ... are hampering ASPECT_DICTATORS_PROSPERITY ... Much like WE are experiencing now , but only for short ASPECT_PERIOD of time , I am thankful ASPECT_AMERICANS are resilient !
4847	1310	No , ASPECT_AMERICAN_CITIZENS , overwhelmingly ... Jollee
4848	1311	As I said , extra-terrestrials .
4849	1312	How does it feel to live in one of little ASPECT_SISTER_COUNTRIES ?
4850	1313	They pay effective 15 regressive ASPECT_PAYROLL_TAX .
4851	1313	ASPECT_UBER_WEALTHY do n't effectively pay SS as percentage of ASPECT_THEY_INCOME .
4852	1314	1500 ASPECT_RETIREES get in checks is what RETIREES use to polish shoe , RETIREES are too good to pay into SS but do n't mind enslaving people who will need 1500 one ASPECT_DAY .
4853	1315	If of ASPECT_GENERAL_PUBLIC would open eyes , Obama ratings would plummet .
4854	1316	He is false ASPECT_PROMISE sheeple of world have bought into .
4855	1316	Luckily , more and folks see true ASPECT_FRAUD that Obama is .
4856	1317	I voted yes ... for now .
4857	1317	could change or ASPECT_NOT in two ASPECT_YEARS .
4858	1317	being said , how could call Obama worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT in history when we just had 8 ASPECT_YEARS of ASPECT_GWB_AMAZES I .
4859	1318	Whether you and your ASPECT_FELLOW_LIBERALS like it or not , ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY is NOT ASPECT_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAM and is not means based .
4860	1318	You seem to think ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY should be another welfare ASPECT_PROGRAM .
4861	1318	YOU already have one of .
4862	1318	ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY is program in which what you get out is proportional to what you put into SECURITY .
4863	1320	Just have to open your ASPECT_EYES .
4864	1321	Please open eyes .
4865	1321	In you view , what ASPECT_ACTIONS by Obama make OBAMA worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT of time ?
4866	1322	I would n't dream of voting for him .
4867	1322	And I preferred HIM over ASPECT_HILLARY_two ASPECT_YEARS ago .
4869	1322	`` who should not have been President
4870	1324	Clinton raised taxes , cut ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING , and got us to surplus ASPECT_BUDGET .
4871	1324	Bush ASPECT_CUT_TAXES , raised ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING , and got US to record deficits .

4873	1325	Here are ASPECT_NATIONAL_Debt ASPECT_FIGURES , year by year .
4874	1325	Would you kindly point out ASPECT_CLINTON surplus where we REDUCED ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT ?
4875	1325	I am not slighting in way excellent ASPECT_CONTROL of spending done by ASPECT_PRESIDENT_CLINTON AND ASPECT_CLINTON_REPUBLICAN controlled Congress .
4876	1325	But fact is WE still went further in debt .
4877	1325	President along with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS did great ASPECT_JOB .

4881	1326	Here 's link to budget , showing surplus in 1999 and ASPECT_2000 .
4882	1326	http:\/\/cbo.gov\/ftpdocs\/108xx\/doc1087...icaltables.pdfHowever , debt of ASPECT_US_GOVT did go down 114 ASPECT_BILLION during Clinton year : debt of ASPECT_US_GOVERNMENT_:12_\/ 31\/1999 5,776,091,314,225.3312 ASPECT_\/ 29\/2000 5,662,216,013,697.37 ASPECT_DEBT to Penny -LRB- Daily ASPECT_HISTORY_SEARCH_APPLICATION -RRB-
4883	1327	revealing ASPECT_ASPECTS of your ASPECT_REPLY .
4884	1327	First , what happens on ASPECT_PARTICULAR_DAY of fiscal ASPECT_YEAR is without merit .
4885	1327	fiscal ASPECT_YEAR of ASPECT_US_GOVT is 9\/30 to 9\/30 .
4886	1327	What is on Mar ASPECT_19 , or ASPECT_DEC_31 means because books are simply open on days .
4887	1327	When books are closed for year -LRB- 9\/30 -RRB- then we have .
4888	1327	Second your ASPECT_LINK to ASPECT_CBO_SHOWS that Clinton years of spending , ASPECT_UNTIL_CLINTON got SADDLED with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS , was larger than Bush years .
4889	1327	In dollars not adjusted for inflation .
4890	1327	And SECOND shows as I have claimed that receipts under Bush , before and after , ASPECT_TAX_CUTS EXCEEDED , and years of Clinton .
4891	1327	And SECOND shows that as &#37; of GDP , Debt was higher in year of Clinton than &#37; was in year of Bush .
4892	1327	And evidently CBO , who is not responsible for PAYING bills , just crunching ASPECT_NUMBERS , does not count ever mounting ASPECT_INTEREST , that Treasury does when they have to pay bills with phantom ASPECT_SURPLUSES .
4893	1327	You do ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON disservice by claiming CLINTON made surplus .
4894	1327	CLINTON was wiser ASPECT_C-IN-C than ASPECT_PRESENT_CLOWN .
4895	1327	Clinton got handed opposing ASPECT_CONGRESS .
4896	1327	CLINTON went into ASPECT_MEETING_ROOMS WITH ` ASPECT_ENEMY ' and haggled out agreement .
4897	1327	You give I ASPECT_TAX_HIKE and I 'll cut WELFARE !
4898	1327	Republicans could not say no to .
4899	1327	ASPECT_CLOWN_BO goes into ASPECT_MEETING_ROOMS with liberal ASPECT_DEMOCRATS only and LOCKS out others and then complains that no ASPECT_ONE will cooperate with THEN .
4900	1327	Being Chicago ASPECT_MOB_BOSS , BOSS never learned cooperate is different than dictate .
4901	1327	Clinton was wise and made of bad ASPECT_SITUATION .
4902	1327	BO is stupid and made worst of good ASPECT_SITUATION .
4903	1327	BO had power and blew WORST with ASPECT_BO_INTRANSIGENCE and arrogance and ASPECT_LACK of experience and ASPECT_PLAIN_IDEOLOGICAL_STUPIDITY .

4953	1335	They need to go .
4954	1339	I 'd guess that ASPECT_YEAR_med ASPECT_STUDENT has desire to learn , while oBum thinks he knows now and public is stooopid .
4955	1340	You 're one who brought up debt , which is amount Govt owes .
4956	1340	ONE 's not measure of budget .
4957	1340	debt decreased 114 ASPECT_BILLION in year ending 12\/31\/00 .
4958	1340	I appreciate you do n't like fact .
4959	1340	No ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRESIDENT achieved .

4963	1340	As percentage of GDP , compared to inflation , or ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_CHANGE , revenues under Bush tanked , and did superb under Clinton .
4964	1340	Just where do you get nonsense ?

4969	1340	No ASPECT_MYTH at all .
4970	1340	Whether you include ASPECT_SS_or ASPECT_NOT , ASPECT_RECORD_deficit ASPECT_CLINTON inherited from Bush was turned into surplus , and second ASPECT_BUSH took surplus and made ASPECT_NEW_RECORD_DEFICIT .
4971	1340	Clinton did SS be scaling back ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING and raising taxes .
4972	1340	Bush squandered ASPECT_SS by slashing taxes and doubling ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING and starting wars .
4973	1340	Obama inherited ASPECT_ECONOMIC_CRISIS unparalleled since great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
4974	1340	We 'll see whether OBAMA gets country back on right ASPECT_COURSE .
4975	1340	Sure , `` pass ASPECT_BUCK_GENERATION does n't want to pay taxes .
4976	1340	ASPECT_REAGAN_BUSH and Bush pandered that ASPECT_SENTIMENT_big ASPECT_TIME .
4977	1340	REASON ASPECT_MAIN_REASON why WE have 13 trillion ASPECT_DEBT .
4978	1341	If of ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_NUTS would admit truth , Obama ratings would go through roof !
4979	1342	You obviously do n't have capability of doing so or you would n't post nonsense .
4980	1343	They are hoping that of wealth will eventually `` trickle down !
4981	1344	Are you for going against Constitution ?
4982	1344	Amendment provides that right , so AMENDMENT is n't matter of what you have endured .1 ASPECT_ST_AMEND : amendment prohibits making of law `` respecting establishment of religion , impeding free ASPECT_EXERCISE of religion , infringing on freedom of speech , infringing on freedom of press , interfering with right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting petitioning for ASPECT_GOVERNMENTAL_REDRESS of grievances .
4983	1344	I would like to know why you hate ASPECT_AMERICAN_MUSLIMS so much , but you defend Bush ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR provides democracy for `` Muslims ?
4984	1344	What is difference ?
4985	1344	Are lives of 3000 dead in NY -LRB- ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO -RRB- more `` sacred than 4000 ASPECT_+_AMERICAN_SOLDIERS have died in Iraq at hands of Muslims ?
4986	1344	Hypocrites speak out of both ASPECT_SIDES of HYPOCRITES ASPECT_MOUTHS .
4987	1344	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY needs to get brain .
4988	1344	America is n't just about `` ASPECT_REPUBLICANS_or `` ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES , FYI .
4989	1345	right-wing wants to go against Constitution !
4990	1345	What joke !
4991	1345	First you say you defend , but you are willing to go against when does n't suit you ?
4992	1346	Wrong ASPECT_ANSWER .
4993	1346	Conservatives adopt ASPECT_LITERAL_WORD-FOR-WORD_INTERPRETATION of ASPECT_UNITED_STATES_CONSTITUTION as INTERPRETATION should be .
4994	1346	Not Liberal ASPECT_JACKWAGON `` living ASPECT_DOCUMENT_HORSE -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- !
4995	1347	You think ?
4996	1347	What ASPECT_LITERAL_WORD for ASPECT_WORD_INTERPRETATION of `` provide for ... ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE could mean anything other than Congress has authority to provide for ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE ?
4997	1349	ASPECT_UNITED_STATES_CONSTITUTION contains two ASPECT_REFERENCES to `` ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE , one occurring in Preamble and in Taxing and ASPECT_SPENDING_CLAUSE .
4998	1349	It is only latter is referred to as `` ASPECT_GENERAL_Welfare ASPECT_CLAUSE of document .
4999	1349	However , LATTER has been argued that , in case of ASPECT_UNITED_STATES_CONSTITUTION , statement regarding `` ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE was not then and is not now intended to give ASPECT_PLENARY_POWER to ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT .
5000	1349	-LRB- 2 -RRB- clauses in ASPECT_U.S._CONSTITUTION are exceptions to ASPECT_TYPICAL_USE of ASPECT_GENERAL_welfare ASPECT_CLAUSE , and are not considered grants of ASPECT_GENERAL_LEGISLATIVE_POWER to ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT as ASPECT_U.S._Supreme ASPECT_COURT has held : Preamble to ASPECT_U.S._CONSTITUTION `` has never been regarded as source of substantive ASPECT_POWER conferred on Government of ASPECT_UNITED_STATES or on of ASPECT_SOURCE_DEPARTMENTS ; -LRB- 3 ASPECT_-RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- and , \* that Associate Justice ASPECT_JOSEPH_STORY construction of Article I , ASPECT_SECTION_8 ASPECT_GENERAL_Welfare ASPECT_CLAUSE_as elaborated in ASPECT_STORY 1833 ASPECT_COMMENTARIES on Constitution of ASPECT_UNITED_STATES was correct ASPECT_INTERPRETATION .
5001	1349	-LRB- 5 ASPECT_-RRB- -LRB- 6 -RRB- Justice ASPECT_STORY concluded that ASPECT_GENERAL_Welfare ASPECT_CLAUSE was not ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_GRANT of power , but qualification on taxing ASPECT_POWER which included within CLAUSE power to spend ASPECT_TAX_REVENUES on matters of ASPECT_GENERAL_INTEREST to ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT .
5002	1349	ASPECT_THOMAS_JEFFERSON explained ASPECT_LATTER_GENERAL_welfare ASPECT_CLAUSE for ASPECT_UNITED_STATES : -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_JEFFERSON laying of taxes is power , and ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE purpose for which power is to be exercised .
5003	1349	AND -LRB- Congress -RRB- are not to lay ASPECT_TAXES_AD_LIBITUM for purpose AND please ; but only to pay debts or provide for welfare of Union .
5004	1349	In like ASPECT_MANNER , AND are not to do anything AND please to provide for ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE , but only to lay taxes for purpose .
5005	1349	-LRB- 7 -RRB- In 1824 Chief Justice ASPECT_JOHN_MARSHALL described in ASPECT_OBITER_DICTUM further ASPECT_LIMIT on ASPECT_GENERAL_Welfare ASPECT_CLAUSE in ASPECT_GIBBONS_v. ASPECT_OGDEN : `` Congress is authorized to lay and collect taxes , & c. to pay debts and provide for ASPECT_COMMON_defense and ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE of ASPECT_UNITED_STATES .
5006	1349	Congress is not empowered to tax for purposes which are within exclusive ASPECT_PROVINCE of States .
5007	1349	-LRB- 8 -RRB-
5008	1350	is supposed to be ASPECT_LITERAL_WORD for ASPECT_WORD_INTERPRETATION ?
5009	1351	Congress shall make no ASPECT_LAW respecting establishment of religion , or prohibiting free ASPECT_EXERCISE thereof ; or abridging freedom of speech , or of press ; or right of people peaceably to assemble , and to petition Government for redress of grievances .
5010	1351	Let see .
5011	1351	Conservatives take `` Congress shall make no ASPECT_LAW respecting establishment of religion or prohibiting free ASPECT_EXERCISE thereof to mean , Only for establishments of religion ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY and\/or conservatives approve of .
5012	1351	`` right of people peaceably to assemble means PEOPLE can only assemble where Republicans\/Conservatives think PEOPLE should , not where REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES is legal for PEOPLE , or where PEOPLE want to .
5013	1351	You actually mean , as PEOPLE want RIGHT to be , right ?
5015	1352	Because ASPECT_YEAR_MEDICAL_STUDENT is n't really ASPECT_YEAR_MEDICAL_STUDENT , is just what Faux ASPECT_NEWS told you .
5016	1352	Obama served 8 ASPECT_YEARS as Senator of Illinois before serving 2 ASPECT_YEARS for ASPECT_US_SENATE .
5017	1352	And , because so called `` ASPECT_SURGEON you speak of was old ASPECT_DOCTOR who followed practices\/skills as ASPECT_SURGEON_MENTOR -LRB- Bush -RRB- , who had killed lot of people during surgery , and SURGEON had airhead Bimbo for ASPECT_SURGEON_NURSE who had no ASPECT_EXPERIENCE as nurse , but SO could see `` ASPECT_HOSPITAL from ASPECT_SO_HOUSE and ASPECT_SO_THOUGHT that qualified ASPECT_SO .
5018	1353	So did ASPECT_YEAR_MEDICAL_STUDENT in analogy .
5019	1353	Obama policies were and are identical to Bush ASPECT_\/_MCCAIN .
5020	1354	I disagree .
5021	1354	Enough of bizarre ASPECT_MANIPULATIONS of Government .
5022	1354	Just go to ASPECT_SIMPLE_consumption ASPECT_TAX , and have ASPECT_TAX_RATE be amount needed for ASPECT_FEDERAL_yearly ASPECT_BUDGET .
5023	1354	Budget goes up - adjust consumption ASPECT_TAX_PERCENTAGE .
5024	1355	Now , now .
5025	1355	Let NOW not make fun of ASPECT_MCSAME_and ASPECT_JUGGS when they are n't here to defend THEY .
5026	1356	loopholes and ASPECT_EXEMPTIONS are ASPECT_BIZZARE_MANIPULATIONS .
5027	1356	consumption ASPECT_TAX is regressive .
5028	1356	Just do ASPECT_SIMPLE_INCOME_TAX with progressive ASPECT_RATES ASPECT_HIGH_ENOUGH for ASPECT_FEDERAL_BUDGET .
5029	1356	Budget goes up , increase ASPECT_TAX_RATES .
5030	1357	ASPECT_ISOLATIONIST_THINKING has caused downfall of cultures throughout history .
5031	1357	Hunkering down in time of global ASPECT_NETWORKING is myopic ASPECT_STRATEGY for strengthening influence of nation .
5032	1357	is part of why Liberals are often frustrated with Conservatives , outward vs. ASPECT_INWARD_THINKING .
5033	1357	What ASPECT_EVIDENCE have you seen that President cares about people that live in countries ?
5034	1358	Why progressive ASPECT_RATES ?
5035	1358	is manipulation .
5036	1358	Do poor ASPECT_PEOPLE use ASPECT_POST_OFFICE equal to rich ?
5037	1358	Do ASPECT_PEOPLE want ASPECT_PEOPLE_BORDERS maintained by militia and navy just like wealthy ASPECT_PERSON would ?
5038	1358	MILITIA seems to ASPECT_OBJECTIVE_PERSON that for part Americans benefit from having existance of ASPECT_UNCLE_SAM and in fact poor ASPECT_PEOPLE are greater ASPECT_STRAIN on system by using things wealthy do not , such as welfare , ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS , ASPECT_MEDICAID_, ASPECT_SECTION-8_HOUSING , WIC , and others .
5039	1358	People should pay for ASPECT_SERVICES_UNCLE_SAM provides equally .
5040	1358	If PEOPLE and I walk into McDonald together ; should we not ASPECT_BE both charged price for ASPECT_WE_happy ASPECT_MEAL ?
5041	1358	Would you think ASPECT_MCDONALD_FAIR if you were charged 50 because you were sporting Rolex , person next to you charged 5 because PERSON had Timex , and ASPECT_THIRD_PERSON given happy ASPECT_MEAL for free because PERSON had no ASPECT_WATCH at all ?
5042	1358	is not how fairness works .
5043	1358	consumption based ASPECT_TAX is fairest ASPECT_WAY to deal with ASPECT_FEDERAL_BUDGET , anything less is biased and offends .
5044	1359	Progressive ASPECT_RATES because 20 ASPECT_&#37;_TAX on guy trying to support family on ASPECT_20K_MEANS GUY family does without ASPECT_BASIC_NECESSITIES .
5045	1359	40 ASPECT_TAX on guy making hundred million ASPECT_MEANS GUY might have to buy smaller ASPECT_MEGA-YACHT .
5046	1359	But ASPECT_GUY_FAMILY does n't have to worry about paying doctor or for education .
5047	1359	I disagree that Govt should be ASPECT_FEE_based ASPECT_ENTERPRISE .
5048	1360	I have ASPECT_OCEAN_FRONT_PROPERTY in Nevada to sell you if you are gullible ASPECT_ENOUGH to believe that BS .
5049	1360	Not kept ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_PROMISES .
5050	1360	No ASPECT_SPECIFICS , of course for right ASPECT_WINGER .
5051	1360	And no ASPECT_PRESIDENT keeps campaign promises .
5052	1360	I remember ASPECT_CERTAIN_PRESIDENT promised to cut trillion off ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT , not act as arrogant ASPECT_NATION or be ASPECT_WORLDS_POLICEMAN , etc. etc. ASPECT_TRANSPARANCY , no not as much as hoped .
5053	1360	But certainly not less ASPECT_TRANSPARANT that republican would be or that Bush was .
5054	1360	ASPECT_RAISE_TAXES on everyone ... really , Your ASPECT_TAXES have not gone up and neither have mine , so is right ASPECT_WING_LIE .
5055	1360	expiration of Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS have not been addressed yet .
5056	1360	ASPECT_INCREASES_SPENDING\/SIZE of government .
5057	1360	Actually , Obama has spent less than Bush did .
5058	1360	And considering ASPECT_MASSIVE_RECESSION , RECESSION would be bad ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY to slash government .
5059	1360	Obama has frozen ASPECT_FEDERAL_BUDGET for agencys , Republicans never did , created ASPECT_NATIONAL_debt ASPECT_COMMISION , republicans never did , cut ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING , republicans never did and turned economy around from ASPECT_MASSIVE_RECCESION to small ASPECT_GROWTH .
5060	1360	Sure we would all like , but ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICIES are far better than ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_ONES .
5061	1360	ignroes people and pushed through legislation .
5064	1360	republicans have used ASPECT_RECONCILLIATION_POLICY far more than democrats , including pushing through both misguided Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
5065	1360	Democrats have had to override ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_FILLIBUSTER of party of no on virtually ASPECT_EVERYTHING , So I would say to stick with reality .
5066	1360	And majority of americans think ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_needed ASPECT_REFORM .
5067	1360	And who wantas president that governs by polls anyway .
5068	1360	has weakened ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY\/BORDER_SECURITY .
5069	1360	is type if pure ASPECT_IGNORANCE really shows gullibility of right ASPECT_WING in nation .
5070	1360	So of ASPECT_AL_QAIDA is at ASPECT_RECORD_LOWS .
5071	1360	of ASPECT_AL_QAIDA killed is at ASPECT_RECORD_HIGHS .
5072	1360	of illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRANTS deported is at ASPECT_RECORD_HIGHS .
5073	1360	troops are in Afghanistan and on Border .
5074	1360	Republicans are so stupid that if president is not up there acting like -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- screaming that you are with us or against US , and `` bring on '' , REPUBLICANS are too dumb to see what ASPECT_PROGRESS is .
5075	1360	Shunning US allies ... seriously .
5076	1360	US allies like Obama hell of lit better than republican .
5077	1360	is just plain ignorant ASPECT_LIES .
5078	1360	Just so you know , forming your ASPECT_OPINION on peoples lies is dumb ASPECT_WAY to form your ASPECT_OPINION .
5079	1361	When are you liberals going to understand that issue is NOT that Bush was good and oBum is bad , OR that Bush was bad and oBum is good .
5080	1361	issue is that Bush WAS bad and oBum is worse .
5081	1363	If you value jobs and want to have president who values security of nation , vote for ... .
5082	1365	Your ASPECT_ONE of smart voting ASPECT_CLASS to say least ASPECT_BROTHER !
5084	1367	`` ASPECT_NUTS on both ASPECT_SIDES do n't matter .
5085	1367	It is Conservative ASPECT_COUNTRY is finally awakening to truth .
5086	1367	Obama ratings are not doing so good .
5087	1368	Mertex , you have to constantly defend yourself in forums .
5088	1368	Maybe , you should rethink who is posting nonsense .
5089	1369	Unfortunately , policies are making businesses go to hell ...
5090	1370	FREEDOM may not agree with Islam , but according to Constitution , mosques can be built in country in order to satisfy `` freedom of religion .
5091	1370	FREEDOM just think there should be sensitivity concerning ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO , and mosque should not be built there .
5092	1370	are not against Constitution like left .
5093	1370	just want to see respect for victims of 9\/11 and families .
5094	1370	Do you not ASPECT_WANT VICTIMS to be respected ?
5095	1371	So , because no ASPECT_PRESIDENT keeps promises is free ASPECT_PASS for Obama ?
5096	1371	Just wait until 1\/1\/2011 .
5097	1371	ASPECT_SEVERAL_TAX_INCREASES will take place .
5098	1371	Do n't worry , Obama has ASPECT_COUPLE_YEARS left to outspend Bush .
5099	1371	Obama contribution to deficit takes cake .
5100	1371	ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION is responsible for actions of Arizona .
5101	1371	DOHS has placed restrictions on ASPECT_LOCAL_and ASPECT_STATE_LAW_ENFORCEMENT_AGENCIES from performing ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_STATUS_CHECKS_and ASPECT_ARRESTS .
5102	1371	Now , they are siding with foreign ASPECT_GOVERNMENT against one of its ASPECT_STATES .
5103	1371	ASPECT_NATIONAL_GUARD_TROOPS that Obama has sent to border can not fire TROOPS ASPECT_WEAPONS , and TROOPS can not enforce ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_LAWS .
5104	1371	TROOPS are there as ASPECT_LIP_SERVICE for wanting ASPECT_BORDER_SECURITY .
5105	1371	Yeah , just ask Israel .
5106	1371	Not ASPECT_LIES , but truth .
5107	1371	You just have n't realized TRUTH yet .
5108	1371	You just can not come to terms that Obama is anything but `` ASPECT_HOPE_and ASPECT_CHANGE .
5109	1372	If you remove incentive to gain wealth by always taking it away and giving IT to bottom ASPECT_PERCENTILE is looking for handout , eventually people lose drive to succeed .
5110	1372	whole ASPECT_REASON I bust I butt at work is to provide better ASPECT_LIFE for I ASPECT_WIFE_and ASPECT_CHILDREN ; not to provide better ASPECT_LIFE for bum with sign at off-ramp of interstate .
5111	1372	is not how I Government is supposed to work .
5112	1372	If wants to help failed in life , should do REASON via churches , not-for-profits , community ASPECT_OUTREACH_PROGRAMS , ASPECT_POST-TAX_DOLLAR_DONATIONS , etc. .
5113	1372	American should pay amount for services ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_RENDERS , just like American should have to pay amount for cheeseburger at McDonalds .
5114	1372	When you start redistributing wealth , then welcome to world of ASPECT_DR._KARL_MARX , Ph.D. and ASPECT_GOODBYE to world of ASPECT_THOMAS_JEFFERSON .
5115	1374	Sadly , point well taken .
5116	1374	Between ASPECT_TAX_CUTS , illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRATION , and ASPECT_MUSLIM_MOSQUE at ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO , I wonder if ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is trying to lose ASPECT_NATIONAL_ELECTION in three ASPECT_MONTHS .
5117	1374	OBAMA certainly is not listening to rank and file Democrats .
5118	1376	Funny about 1.3 trillion ASPECT_DEFICIT carried over from ASPECT_PREVIOUS_ADMINISTRATION is that TARP was ASPECT_HUGE_PART of DEFICIT .
5119	1376	Obama voted for TARP and then fought to spend second ASPECT_HALF of 700 ASPECT_BILLION when in Congress wanted to block funds .
5120	1377	And TARP was passed by Democrat controlled ASPECT_HOUSE_and ASPECT_SENATE , NOT Republican controlled Congress .
5121	1377	Bush complicity was in signing ASPECT_COMPLICITY .
5122	1377	BUSH should have vetoed COMPLICITY .
5123	1377	And 1.3 ASPECT_TRILLION carry over was ALSO from Democrat controlled Congress .
5124	1377	TRILLION IS Congress actually spends money .
5125	1377	President is not one normally spends money .
5126	1377	Unless ASPECT_PRESIDENT_WIFE is vacationing in Spain .
5127	1378	I just think it 's interesting that of ASPECT_PEEBO_DEVOTEES are willing to overlook Obama complicity .
5128	1378	OBAMA speaking out of both ASPECT_SIDES of ASPECT_OBAMA_MOUTH and ASPECT_OBJECTIVE_RESPONSE from ASPECT_OBAMA_useful ASPECT_IDIOTS are ASPECT_OCCASIONAL_fainting ASPECT_SPELLS .
5129	1379	There were Muslims who died at ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO , also .
5130	1379	Community ASPECT_CENTER they are trying to build is not on ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO - CENTER is like two ASPECT_BLOCKS away .
5131	1379	Did you know Muslims have ASPECT_PRAYER_ROOM at Pentagon ?
5132	1379	plane hit there also , why are dead at Pentagon not `` sacred like ones at ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO ?
5133	1379	And what do Muslims are trying to build Mosque have to do with Al-Qaeda , ones hit towers ?
5134	1379	Do we hold `` ASPECT_MUSLIMS_RESPONSIBLE for what terrorists did ?
5135	1379	If is case , then explain to me why WE sacrificed 4000 ASPECT_+_SOLDIERS to provide Iraq with democracy .
5136	1379	SOLDIERS are Muslims , and ground in Iraq is sacred as ASPECT_WE_SOLDIERS died there .
5137	1379	Republican\/conservative argument does n't make sense .
5138	1379	Please explain where Democrats are against Constitution .
5139	1379	You claim you are not against Constitution , you just do n't want to do what ASPECT_CONSTITUTION says .
5140	1379	And now , bunch of radicals are trying to change ASPECT_14TH_AMENDMENT ?
5141	1379	Yeah , you are not against Constitution , you are just trying to rewrite CONSTITUTION .
5142	1379	And , ME do n't see how community ASPECT_CENTER\/MOSQUE_two ASPECT_BLOCKS away in way disrespects people died on 9\/11 .
5143	1379	If was trying to build statue in honor of 19 ASPECT_HIJACKERS -LRB- ASPECT_AL_QAEDA -RRB- ME would definitely be against STATUE , but mosque is n't being built to honor ASPECT_HIJACKERS .
5144	1380	Disputing would only prolong silliness of your ASPECT_HYPOTHESIS .
5145	1380	WASTE waste of time .
5146	1381	Is , `` I ca n't , in liberal ASPECT_DOUBLESPEAK ?
5147	1382	funny is , is that 48 ASPECT_BILLION is still sitting in treasury is part of ASPECT_STIMULUS_FUNDS .
5148	1382	They threw money into ASPECT_SHOVEL_ready ASPECT_JOBS_and ASPECT_PORK_PROJECTS but why do n't THEY just give what 's left back so taxpayers do n't have as ASPECT_DEBT ?
5149	1382	Why is money just sitting there ?
5150	1383	Tell to families of victims of 9\/11 .
5151	1383	There are also questions surrounding funding of mosque by folks related to Al-Qaeda .
5152	1383	Also , there is no ASPECT_MUSLIM_PRAYER_ROOM at Pentagon .
5153	1383	I have been there .
5154	1383	CHAPEL is ASPECT_NON-DENOMINATIONAL_PENTAGON_MEMORIAL_CHAPEL .
5155	1383	I think CHAPEL has to do with funding .
5156	1383	I 'm sure they can come up with plan to build CHAPEL elsewhere .
5157	1384	There are ASPECT_MUSLIM_FAMILIES of victims of 9\/11 .
5158	1384	What about FAMILIES ?
5159	1384	And of uproar is coming from ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_, who has taken UPROAR upon FAMILIES to equate Muslims with Al-Qaeda .
5160	1384	Is there links to back UPROAR up or is UPROAR just ASPECT_SPECULATION ?
5161	1384	UPROAR may be non-denominational , but Muslims meet there to pray - ASPECT_FAMILIES_PLAN to do in NY , so what is difference ?
5162	1384	Amid flaring ASPECT_POLITICAL_DEBATE about proposed ASPECT_NEW_YORK_City ASPECT_MOSQUE near ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO , there has been little ASPECT_COMMOTION about Pentagon chapel where Muslims can gather in daily ASPECT_PRAYER near where ASPECT_HIJACKED_JETLINER struck building ASPECT_SEPT._11 , ASPECT_2001 .
5163	1384	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/ABCNEWS.GO.COM\/POLITICS\/MOSQU...RY?ID=11417673_PERSISTENT_and ASPECT_HEATED_CLAIMS in courts , Congress , and media that Patient ASPECT_PROTECTION and Affordable ASPECT_CARE_ACT is unconstitutional , and suggestion by ASPECT_SENATE_REPUBLICANS that ASPECT_GENERAL_KAGAN should not be confirmed as Supreme ASPECT_COURT_JUSTICE because she might uphold Act .
5164	1384	ASPECT_KENTUCKY_SENATE_CANDIDATE and ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_darling ASPECT_RAND_PAUL s assertion that ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT does not have power to root out ASPECT_PRIVATE_DISCRIMINATION under ASPECT_CIVIL_RIGHTS_ACT of 1964 , one of important ASPECT_PIECES of legislation passed pursuant to Congress s constitutional ASPECT_AUTHORITY to enforce ASPECT_14TH_AMENDMENT s guarantee of equality .
5165	1384	call by ASPECT_RAND_PAUL , ASPECT_REP._DUNCAN_HUNTER and others for repeal of ASPECT_14TH_AMENDMENT s guarantee of citizenship at birth for children born in ASPECT_UNITED_STATES , and efforts in states such as Arizona to interfere with Amendment s guarantee of ASPECT_EQUAL_CITIZENSHIP .
5166	1384	ASPECT_NEVADA_SENATE_candidate ASPECT_SHARRON_ANGLE s suggestion Americans should repeal ASPECT_16TH_AMENDMENT , which allows for ASPECT_FEDERAL_INCOME_TAX .
5167	1384	ASPECT_UTAH_SENATE_candidate ASPECT_MIKE_LEE s argument that ASPECT_LEE_STATE can use Constitution s ASPECT_ENCLAVE_CLAUSE to take land from ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT in Utah .
5168	1384	call by ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_ACTIVISTS for repeal of ASPECT_17TH_AMENDMENT , in order to take power to elect ASPECT_U.S._SENATORS away from ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_VOTERS and give PARTY back to ASPECT_STATE_LEGISLATORS .
5169	1384	Disturbing ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_RHETORIC suggesting that perceived unconstitutional ASPECT_ACTIONS by ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT are cause for ASPECT_ARMED_REBELLION and claim that Founders would cheer violence .
5170	1384	argument by ASPECT_SENATOR_TOM_COBURN and others that Kagan should not be confirmed because 17TH , in ASPECT_FOUNDERS_VIEW , would not commit during 17TH ASPECT_JUDICIARY_Committee ASPECT_TESTIMONY to enforcing God-given ASPECT_NATURAL_or inalienable ASPECT_RIGHTS mentioned in Declaration of Independence .
5171	1384	I 'm sure there are plenty that I could dig up .
5172	1384	Tell ASPECT_RAND_PAUL , ASPECT_REP_HUNTER and others .
5173	1384	I 'm sure if funding is coming from ASPECT_AL_QAEDA_FUNDING will be disclosed , and whole ASPECT_ISSUE will take different ASPECT_COURSE , but if FUNDING is n't , trying to tie OTHERS to ASPECT_AL_QAEDA is gross ASPECT_MISCARRIAGE of justice .
5174	1385	like ASPECT_DAN40 ; 2845093 is using ASPECT_INFO_and ASPECT_MISINTERPRETATION to prove disingenuous ASPECT_POINT !
5175	1386	Dan40 uses best and ASPECT_NEUTRAL_INFORMATION US can find .
5176	1386	Whenever possible US us ASPECT_US_GOVERNMENTS_REPORTS .
5177	1386	Which are more and more looking like ASPECT_ANTI-OBUM_REPORTS .
5178	1386	But US are just presenting grim ASPECT_FACTS that oBum has failed .
5179	1386	And you accuse US , yet you prove .
5180	1386	You continue to make snide ASPECT_REMARKS inferring your ASPECT_OPINION is better than US opinion .
5181	1386	From here , your ASPECT_OPINION is worthless .
5182	1386	Try posting fact .
5183	1388	ASPECT_MUSLIM_VICTIM of 9\/11 : ` Build your ASPECT_MOSQUE somewhere else ' : I have no ASPECT_GRAVE_SITE to visit , no ASPECT_PLACE to bring I mother MOTHER favorite yellow ASPECT_FLOWERS , no ASPECT_SPOT where I can hold I weary ASPECT_HEART_CLOSE to MOTHER .
5184	1388	I have is ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO .
5185	1388	On morning of Tuesday , ASPECT_SEPT._11 , ASPECT_2001 , I watched as terrorists slammed ASPECT_UNITED_FLIGHT_175 into ASPECT_SOUTH_TOWER of World ASPECT_TRADE_CENTER , 18 ASPECT_MINUTES after ASPECT_TERRORISTS_ACCOMPLICES on another ASPECT_HIJACKED_PLANE hit ASPECT_NORTH_TOWER .
5186	1388	I mother was on flight .
5187	1388	I witnessed ASPECT_MOTHER_MURDER on ASPECT_LIVE_TELEVISION .
5188	1388	I still can not fully comprehend images .
5189	1388	In moment , I died as well .
5190	1388	I carry hole in ASPECT_I_HEART will never be filled .
5191	1388	From ASPECT_MEMORIAL_CEREMONIES I attended at ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO , I have always been moved by site ; it means to be close to where I mother may be buried , brings peace .
5192	1388	is why prospect of mosque near ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO -- or church or synagogue or ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_or nationalistic ASPECT_MONUMENT_or ASPECT_SYMBOL -- troubles I .
5193	1388	: http:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/wp-dyn...080603006.html Just saying PROSPECT is questionable .
5194	1388	Link : http:\/\/www.newsmax.com\/Headline\/grou...8\/05\/id\/366712 mosque is specific to islam .
5195	1388	I do n't agree with Republicans , but ASPECT_CURRENT_ADMINISTRATION is screwing country up , and too ASPECT_PEOPLE can not see ADMINISTRATION .
5196	1389	You had eight ASPECT_YEARS of Democrats giving away ASPECT_HOMES , ruining economy and voting for war you did not want .
5197	1389	Now people that ruined ASPECT_US on homes brings US ASPECT_HEALTH_INS_FIASCO , ASPECT_PEOPLE_NUMBERS forged , changed , lied about to get passed ASPECT_DONT_WANT ... I give you Democrats ... Get US HELL ASPECT_AWAY_FROM_MANIACS ... Oh wait , Obama did not build ASPECT_MOSQUE_YET ... .
5198	1389	Oh I get NOW , you want to forget about house , you want to forget PEOPLE voted for war , you like people paying another ASPECT_PERSONS_BILLS ...
5199	1390	TERRIFIED am terrified of Obama .
5200	1390	OBAMA is giving away children birthright in ASPECT_MULTI-TRILLION_DOLLAR_CHUNKS and OBAMA has hallmarks of dictator by forcing to buy product by force of ASPECT_LAW_and ASPECT_JAIL -LRB- even if stated ASPECT_OTHERWISE \*\* -RRB- .
5201	1390	OBAMA has endorsed monster mosque that about 70 ASPECT_&#37; are vehemently against .
5202	1390	OBAMA ASPECT_COMPANY includes ASPECT_TERRORISTS_and ASPECT_EX_RADICALS EX resisted showing EX ASPECT_BIRTH_CERTIFICATE and broke dozens of promises .
5203	1390	And TERRIFIED am just getting started !
5204	1390	TERRIFIED think ASPECT_OBAMA_ACTIONS_BORDER on criminal and very ASPECT_MILDEST_PUNISHMENT ASPECT_NEAR_DESPOT should receive is impeachment .
5205	1390	In ASPECT_TERRIFIED_OPINION_OBAMA is threat to ASPECT_COUNTRIES_COUNTIES_EXISTENCE as ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_REPUBLIC of -LRB- somewhat -RRB- free ASPECT_MEN .
5206	1390	We should replace OBAMA with runs against OBAMA runs on platform of less ASPECT_GOVERNMENT .
5207	1390	http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/...oken-promises\/\*\* When forced to say what would happen to that ` willingly refused ' to buy ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_mandated ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE , HTTP:\/\/WWW.WASHINGTONTIMES.COM\/NEWS\/...OKEN-PROMISES\/\*\* admitted TAX would be as not filing and\/or avoiding paying income tax , if fraud or ASPECT_INTENTIONAL_MISREPRESENTATION were employed would carry ASPECT_JAIL_TIME than simply refusing to pay .
5209	1391	They probably will , in fact there are talks that THEY might .
5210	1391	And means that Muslims are lot more reasonable and understanding than recalcitrant ASPECT_REPUBLICANS .
5211	1391	Why are you attributing what 19 ASPECT_AL_QAEDA did to Muslims ?
5212	1391	Should Christians be blamed when Christian commits horrible ASPECT_CRIME ?
5213	1391	is totally bizarre - church , or ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_MONUMENT is usually symbol of peace and ASPECT_LOVE .
5214	1391	I think person is not being `` honest - just upset because MOSQUE happens to be Muslim .
5215	1391	Do n't think they are certain .
5216	1391	But MOSQUE is n't even `` ASPECT_MOSQUE - MOSQUE community ASPECT_CENTER .
5217	1391	So your whole ASPECT_ARGUMENT breaks down .
5218	1391	Reps do n't like Constitution as it is written because CONSTITUTION interferes with ASPECT_REPS_AGENDA .
5219	1391	You are kidding , of course .
5220	1391	of your ASPECT_POSTS reflect right-wing , GOP , ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_IDEOLOGY !
5221	1392	Then except for ASPECT_GOP_PART , he posts pretty good .
5222	1392	And I think you got ASPECT_GOP_PART wrong .
5223	1392	You always try to paint I with brush to .
5224	1393	Then except for ASPECT_GOP_PART , he posts pretty good .
5225	1393	And I think you got ASPECT_GOP_PART wrong .
5226	1393	You always try to paint I with brush to .
5227	1396	Republicans are n't ones against Mosque near ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO .
5228	1396	I never did .
5229	1396	I just think sensitivity to victims ' ASPECT_FAMILIES needs to be taken into consideration .
5230	1396	ASPECT_ISLAMIC_Community ASPECT_CENTER .
5231	1396	can be said of politicians .
5232	1396	of I posts reflect , I am sick of bloated ASPECT_BUREAUCRACY in Washington wasting ASPECT_TAX_DOLLARS and not listening to People .
5233	1396	Unless your ASPECT_HAPPY with Washington , big ASPECT_GOVERNMENT , taxes , bureaucracy , you should be part of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT yourself .
5234	1398	When you 're waiting hour and half for plane , do you ever wonder why you have to get there so early ?
5235	1398	Do you ever wonder why your ASPECT_FAMILY does n't get to come to gate to see you off like they used to ?
5236	1398	estimated 7 of Muslims are radical .
5237	1398	works out to about ASPECT_84,000,000 by conservative ASPECT_ESTIMATES .
5238	1399	Because she says garbage you do ?
5240	1399	If BWAHAHAHA walks like duck , looks like duck , quacks like duck , BWAHAHAHA is duck !
5241	1400	Gee , if is true , then why were you willing that sacrifice over 4000 ASPECT_+ of soldiers to give `` ASPECT_MUSLIMS democracy ?
5242	1400	How do know that of 84,000,000 are not in Iraq ?
5243	1400	How do Reps get to designate which ASPECT_ONES are bad ?
5244	1401	You have handful of Dems got sucked into `` sensitivity ASPECT_BS and ASPECT_HARRY_REID , who is vying for votes from whacko Angle , so REID has to appeal to righties .
5245	1401	When you associate ASPECT_AMERICAN_MUSLIMS with 9\/11 ASPECT_INCIDENT you are in ASPECT_SENSE_holding ASPECT_RIGHTIES responsible for INCIDENT .
5246	1401	RIGHTIES had victims there too .
5247	1401	INCIDENT is still not mosque .
5248	1401	politicians are n't trying to change amendments like reps are .
5249	1401	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is farce .
5250	1401	of supporters of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY would bring back in minute , no ASPECT_MATTER what he did to country .
5252	1402	is post and I may have made ASPECT_TYPO_or ASPECT_THREE .
5253	1402	If you see that angers you such as I not adding ASPECT_&#8216;_radical ASPECT_&#8217;_PREFIX before &#8216; ASPECT_MUSLIM &#8217; please ask I if is what I meant !
5254	1402	I have no ASPECT_PROBLEMS with ASPECT_ISLAM_or ASPECT_MUSLIMS or religion including have lack of religion .
5255	1402	I do have problem with haters who hate for unspecified ASPECT_REASONS or simply don &#8217; like Christianity or ASPECT_RELIGION and have need to bash Christians at turn .
5256	1402	And as ASPECT_PREACHER_church ASPECT_OWNER , and ASPECT_NON_profit Christian humanitarian ASPECT_MISSION_OWNER I do not tolerate or will not be around I Christian ASPECT_BROTHERS and sisters that hate for reasons as above .
5257	1402	ASPECT_WHEW_~_HI_MERTEX !
5258	1402	If supporters and doing funding -LRB- no ASPECT_ONE knows who is funding Mosque as of ASPECT_AUG_1 2010 -RRB- ASPECT_ETC would build somewhere else I would be willing to bet that conservative ASPECT_GROUP would donate land to build GROUP on as ASPECT_RECIPROCAL_GESTURE of good ASPECT_FAITH .
5259	1402	FUNDING just guess but I know I conservatives .
5260	1402	-LRB- I lean towards conservative ASPECT_SIDE mostly because of I religion -RRB- .
5261	1402	Nevertheless , If CONSERVATIVES go ahead with plans to build ASPECT_MOSQUE_MOSQUE will be very dangerous ASPECT_PLACE to be and MOSQUE will breed seething , venomous ASPECT_ANGER all ASPECT_WAY_ROUND_' .
5262	1402	ASPECT_MOSQUE_SUPPORTERS certainly have right to build MOSQUE , but what ASPECT_GESTURE_GESTURE would be if SUPPORTERS decided to move GESTURE !
5263	1402	As devout Christian I too think is wrong .
5264	1402	Maybe CHRISTIAN meant radical Muslims ?
5265	1402	Moderate ASPECT_ISLAM is beautiful ASPECT_RELIGION fairly mirrors Christianity right up to where Abraham almost sacrifices ASPECT_ABRAHAM_SON .
5266	1402	I surgeon of five ASPECT_YEARS is devout ASPECT_MUSLIM , and she is beautiful I must say !
5267	1402	Trust I if I lumped Muslims together I would find another ASPECT_MD !
5268	1402	Yes , but is point , There are too ASPECT_COINCIDENCES for there not to be malicious going on .
5269	1402	I was somewhat against ASPECT_MOSQUE_BEFORE I found out that MOSQUE would be dedicated on anniversary of 9\/11 !
5270	1402	was what turned I against MOSQUE , Then I researched where funding originated and ASPECT_CORDOBA_GROUP_ETC. .
5271	1402	bad ASPECT_FEELINGS !
5272	1402	I feel true ASPECT_INTENT is not good .
5273	1402	I also feel that good ASPECT_MUSLIMS that support Mosque as well as secular ASPECT_LIBERALS_ETC have been fooled by malicious ASPECT_ELEMENT into believing that intent and purpose of projected ASPECT_MOSQUE is benign and meant to foster good will etc. .
5274	1402	Can you clarify and expand on ?
5275	1402	What is wrong with ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_, ASPECT_GOP_, ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_IDEOLOGY ?
5276	1402	Personally being Anarchist -LRB- I would like to rearrange ASPECT_USA_COMPLETELY -RRB- but ASPECT_REGISTERED_INDEPENDENT I feel that ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_, ASPECT_GOP_, ASPECT_TEA_PARTY will save country from sure ASPECT_DESTRUCTION by well meaning liberals .
5277	1402	LIBERALS are led by malicious ASPECT_ELEMENT who thinks can spend way out of recession .
5278	1402	Yes malicious ASPECT_ELEMENT is none other than Obama !
5279	1402	OBAMA insists on socializing ASPECT_COUNTRY , which is another sure ASPECT_WAY to break bank .
5280	1402	OBAMA seems hell bent to do to ruin shaky ASPECT_RECOVERY -LRB- and jobless ASPECT_ONE at -RRB- .
5281	1402	And I think OBAMA has plans for making ASPECT_USA_fully ASPECT_SOCIALIST .
5282	1402	Then there is fact that administration thinks can appease ASPECT_TALIBAN_TYPES or ASPECT_BEN_Laden ASPECT_STYLE_TERRORISTS who are freedom ASPECT_FIGHTERS of major ASPECT_ISLAMIC_world ASPECT_POWERS .
5283	1402	states want to destroy Israel and ASPECT_USA_ASAP .
5284	1402	ASPECT_TERRORIST_SPONSORING_NATIONS and oil rich ASPECT_CITIZENS_FUND_& give ASPECT_AID_and ASPECT_SUPPORT to anti christian anti secular ASPECT_WESTERN_TERRORISTS and ASPECT_ISLAMIC_MILITANTS .
5285	1402	CITIZENS stated ASPECT_PRIMARY_GOAL is to convert or kill of us including ASPECT_CHILDREN and everyone does not convert to Islam .
5286	1402	ASPECT_GOAL_TIME to give ASPECT_MILITARIZED_radical ASPECT_ISLAMIC_TERRORISTS ASPECT_OFFER_TERRORISTS should not and ultimately can not refuse .
5287	1402	TIME should TERRORIST fair ASPECT_OFFER .
5288	1402	However , should then take zero tolerance ASPECT_POLICY with regards to terror ASPECT_AND began isolating ASPECT_WESTERN_HEMISPHERE militarily industrially economically scientifically with emphasis on pure ASPECT_R&D .
5290	1403	Your ASPECT_MISCONCEPTIONS , misunderstandings , and outright ASPECT_FEAR of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY make your ASPECT_POSTS about them laughable .
5291	1403	NO ASPECT_ONE at ASPECT_TEA_PARTY I 've attended would ever think of bringing Bush back even if NO was possible .
5292	1403	near ASPECT_INSTANTANEOUS_GROWTH of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY after elections was because we thought WE could put calamity of Bush ASPECT_YEARS behind WE and get on with repairing nation .
5293	1403	Instead WE were presented with even incompetent idiot ASPECT_CLOWN without clue of what Presidency means or how to even begin doing job .
5294	1403	And now approaching 2 ASPECT_YEARS later , ASPECT_CLOWN_SHOWS on daily ASPECT_BASIS that CLOWN is in fact clown that history will find hilarious , but not for , ASPECT_YEARS .
5295	1403	good ASPECT_NEWS is CLOWN has started another ASPECT_VACATION .
5296	1403	time on Martha Vineyard for 10 ASPECT_DAYS .
5297	1403	Did they get unpacked from one ?
5298	1403	But when 10 's on vacation , 10 's doing less ASPECT_DAMAGE to nation .
5299	1403	Failure on daily ASPECT_BASIS must be so extremely exhausting that 10 ASPECT_NEEDS constant ASPECT_VACATIONS .
5300	1403	When liberals lose control of Congress in ASPECT_NOV._10 will need overlapping vacations from then ASPECT_ON .
5301	1404	Are you claiming that Muslims are trying to convert ASPECT_WAL-MART_BUILDING into community ASPECT_CENTER are radical ASPECT_MUSLIMS ?
5302	1404	Otherwise , WAL-MART does n't make sense - why you would associate YOU with ASPECT_AL_QAEDA is responsible for 9\/11 .
5303	1404	WAL-MART would be understandable if YOU were , that YOU would not be welcome ASPECT_SIGHT anywhere near ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO .
5304	1404	GOP have no ASPECT_DOUBT that there would be Christian -LRB- wealthy ASPECT_PERSON -RRB- would be more than generous and would donate land , but of ones complaining are more interested in just denying people ASPECT_PEOPLE_Constitutional ASPECT_RIGHT and have created `` sensitivity ASPECT_BS , since building is not even close to ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO .
5305	1404	GOP realize that , but conservatives do less that resembles what Christ would want CONSERVATIVES to do when LAND comes to politics , that ASPECT_GOP_WONDER why so ASPECT_BELIEVE are doing what Christ would want to do .
5306	1404	ASPECT_GOP_WONDER if Christians were ones building church and Muslims were complaining , if Christians would be as willing to move or would ONES do what so many of ONES do , and become violent and ASPECT_HATEFUL .
5307	1404	Like when ONES are told to remove statue of 10 ASPECT_COMMANDMENTS out of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_BUILDING - and ONES go against laws ?
5308	1404	If Muslims are willing to build somewhere else , would be great , but GOP can not see where we can disregard what Constitution guarantees just to placate people sensitivities .
5309	1404	Christians have to be sensitive to feelings of others , too .
5310	1404	She was attributing waits at airports and changes WE have had to get used to , due to horrible ASPECT_CRIME committed on 9\/11 by ASPECT_ISLAMIC_TERRORISTS , but TERRORISTS do not make up ASPECT_ISLAM_RELIGION , so it is wrong to condemn of them for what extremists of ASPECT_TERRORISTS_RELIGION are doing .
5311	1404	ASPECT_GOP_ANSWER to SHE was , if `` Muslims are to be suspect , then why did WE sacrifice 4000 ASPECT_+ of ASPECT_WE_MEN_and ASPECT_WOMEN to provide with Democracy .
5312	1404	WE are willing to sacrifice ASPECT_WE_LIVES to provide with democracy but start whining at building ASPECT_MOSQUE_, or community ASPECT_CENTER ?
5313	1404	You tell GOP where makes sense .
5314	1404	Unfortunately , of ones protesting community ASPECT_CENTER_CLAIM that ONES do n't have anything against Muslims , but if you are not able to distinguish between were responsible for 9\/11 and who lost loved ones on 9\/11 , and want to build would be good , claim becomes blurred .
5315	1404	GOP just read article where leaders of planned community ASPECT_CENTER have decided against ASPECT_BUILDING_CENTER there .
5316	1404	ARTICLE would seem to GOP that if LEADERS had malicious ASPECT_AGENDA_LEADERS would not have given up .
5317	1404	However , how do you feel about : ASPECT_NEW_YORK_REPUBLICAN_PARTY is also said to be planning hostile ASPECT_TELEVISION_CAMPAIGN .
5318	1404	Does n't sound like bunch of Christians to GOP .
5319	1404	What ASPECT_EVIL could ASPECT_GOP possible be planning ?
5320	1404	If they are really evil motivated ASPECT_PEOPLE , again , why do Republicans\/conservatives defend ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR ?
5321	1404	Now you have gone and called ASPECT_MUSLIMS_IGNORANT .
5322	1404	THEY would not be able to figure out that THEY are being manipulated , sounds little condescending ASPECT_AND that GOP find alarming ASPECT_COMING from calls CONDESCENDING Christian .
5323	1404	As if , oppose Mosque are ones blessed with ability to see beyond obvious ASPECT_, and know what is in people hearts .
5324	1404	There are mosques in area , and also bars .
5325	1404	So , why does one ASPECT_HOLD_`` special ASPECT_POWERS ?
5326	1404	On Sunday , ASPECT_JON_KYL -LRB- R-AZ -RRB- went on Face Nation and suggested , that with ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABIES running around , SUNDAY might be time to scrap ASPECT_14TH_AMENDMENT .
5327	1404	Now , ASPECT_SENATE_MINORITY_LEADER agrees .
5328	1404	ASPECT_SENATE_MINORITY_LEADER_MITCH_MCCONNELL is latest ASPECT_HIGH-PROFILE_REPUBLICAN to say Congress should reconsider guarantee of ASPECT_BIRTHRIGHT_CITIZENSHIP provided by ASPECT_14TH_AMENDMENT , in light of ASPECT_CURRENT_DEBATE over ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_REFORM .
5329	1404	http:\/\/firedoglake.com\/2010\/08\/03\/re...-brown-people\/ I did n't say there was anything wrong with ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_IDEOLOGY , GOP was just reminding poster that even if 14TH ASPECT_CLAIMS 14TH is n't , 14TH ASPECT_POSTS say otherwise .
5330	1404	But , as far as ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_, ASPECT_GOP_, ASPECT_TEA_PARTY saving country , of people are part of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY were ASPECT_GEORGE_Bush ASPECT_SUPPORTERS and know what BUSH did to country .
5331	1404	And ASPECT_GOP_KNOW of ASPECT_PEOPLE_IDEOLOGY is `` ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for wealthy !
5332	1404	Pardon expression but is bunch of crap .
5333	1404	is rhetoric ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH and rest of wealthy ASPECT_REPUBLICANS are saying because PEOPLE want to keep ASPECT_PEOPLE_TAX_CUTS .
5335	1404	GOP thought you sounded rational for while - now you are beginning to sound like rest of `` ASPECT_SCARED to death by ASPECT_GOP_MEDIA_CROWD .
5336	1406	ITS s run down ASPECT_TEXTILE_MILL .
5337	1406	No am not saying .
5338	1406	CHRISTIAN am suspicious of why ITS being built were its being build and do not believe developer .
5339	1406	CHRISTIAN fully agree It was not moderate ASPECT_MUSLIMS_FAULT that religion is being hijacked by radical ASPECT_ELEMENTS .
5340	1406	developers are within ASPECT_DEVELOPERS_RIGHTS to build FAULT .
5341	1406	And ASPECT_OPEN_and ASPECT_DEDICATE on 9\/11 .
5342	1406	But having right does not make building RIGHT right !
5343	1406	CHRISTIAN feel bad for both ASPECT_SIDES that there is so ASPECT_TORMENT over mosque , however CHRISTIAN can understand why majority of Americans are against MOSQUE .
5344	1406	ASPECT_MOSQUE_five hundred ASPECT_FEET from ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO .
5345	1406	terrorists were ASPECT_MUSLIM_EXTREMIST .
5346	1406	prayers will blast out over loud ASPECT_SPEAKER five ASPECT_TIMES day reminding victims and family s of victims what happened .
5347	1406	CHRISTIAN am happy you are of faith !
5348	1406	CHRISTIAN too am Christian .
5349	1406	CHRISTIAN was atheist prior to but ASPECT_GOD broke CHRISTIAN legs to make CHRISTIAN ASPECT_OFFER_CHRISTIAN couldn t refuse ie ASPECT_DIE or try Christianity !
5350	1406	ASPECT_HA_HA .
5351	1406	Anyway well with due respect ASPECT_CHRISTIAN disagree with popular ASPECT_INTERPRETATION of Romans .
5352	1406	Here is site that CHRISTIAN think mirrors CHRISTIAN ASPECT_UNDERSTANDING of scripture .
5353	1406	SITE s different than what you believe , but maybe we can at least understand ASPECT_OTHERS_BELIEFS .
5354	1406	CHRISTIAN am guilty of calling Obama names out of anger and ASPECT_FEAR and agree ANGER not ASPECT_ANYTHING to be proud of , but CHRISTIAN do not think ANGER s terribly bad ASPECT_SIN .
5355	1406	http:\/\/www.wnd.com\/news\/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=22417Sorry for not putting ANGER in CHRISTIAN ASPECT_WORDS but CHRISTIAN have been writing ASPECT_GRANT_PROPOSALS for missions two ASPECT_DAYS_and ASPECT_NIGHTS_NON_STOP so least ASPECT_TYPING_CHRISTIAN have to do better !
5356	1406	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.WND.COM\/NEWS\/ARTICLE.ASP?ARTICLE_ID=22417SORRY_500 ASPECT_FEET from ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO and call to prayer will easily be heard at ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO .
5357	1406	CHRISTIAN am surprised that you think 3000 ASPECT_FAMILIES of dead and ASPECT_DOUBLE that wounded would be lying about harm is going to do .
5358	1406	saddens CHRISTIAN that you would think especially after you are so adamant about offending Obama by calling ASPECT_OBAMA_NAMES_ETC. .
5359	1406	Think about 3000 .
5360	1406	3000 ASPECT_FAMILIES s at least ASPECT_SIX to nine thousand ASPECT_PEOPLE not to mention survivors of attacks .
5361	1406	CHRISTIAN don t think FAMILIES want to deny ASPECT_FAMILIES_RIGHTS , but kind of will breed anger and ASPECT_HURT .
5362	1406	for what ?
5363	1406	What by protesting mosque ?
5364	1406	CHRISTIAN agree that liberal ASPECT_POLITICS are more in line with ASPECT_JESUS_TEACHINGS , but CHRISTIAN would not fear Jesus if CHRISTIAN were in peaceful protest ASPECT_MARCH when JESUS came back .
5365	1406	CHRISTIAN believe developers of mosque has hidden motives for building mosque too .
5366	1406	CHRISTIAN will be interested in seeing where funding is coming from .
5367	1406	Christians would not build church on top of ASPECT_MUSLIM_CEMETERY for starters , and CHRISTIAN believe STARTERS would .
5368	1406	CHRISTIAN are Christian would you move your ASPECT_CHURCH if situation was reversed ?
5369	1406	CHRISTIAN would .
5370	1406	With due ASPECT_RESPECT , you seem less and less like Christian you talk .
5371	1406	ten ASPECT_COMMANDANTS_PLAQUES are tradition in cases .
5372	1406	ASPECT_CONGRESS_PRAYS for tradition as well .
5373	1406	In ASPECT_CASES_CONGRESS s attitude of ASPECT_ACTIVIST_ATHEISTS make Christians bow up .
5374	1406	In case CHRISTIAN have seen atheists want to harm or destroy Christianity by forcing ends to ASPECT_HELD_TRADITIONS .
5375	1406	In ASPECT_CASES_ATHEISTS want to harm us not to improve anything .
5376	1406	Your ASPECT_IDEAS of obeying corrupt ASPECT_GOVERNMENT are not Christian CHRISTIAN ASPECT_FRIEND .
5377	1406	CHRISTIAN wish you would take time to read opposing ASPECT_VIEWS .
5378	1406	ASPECT_LINK_CHRISTIAN gave you is start .
5379	1406	Remember Jesus was rebel .
5380	1406	True ASPECT_CHRISTIAN never have .
5381	1406	CHRISTIAN am Reverend .
5382	1406	So CHRISTIAN see and talk to lot of Christians .
5383	1406	There is ignorance out there , however traditional ASPECT_CHRISTIANS do not hate Muslims , just ASPECT_RADICALIZED_TERRORISTS want to impose ASPECT_CHRISTIANS_RELIGION on us or murder US .
5384	1406	CHRISTIAN already did in CHRISTIAN ASPECT_POST .
5385	1406	CHRISTIAN gave ASPECT_SEVERAL_REASONS and CHRISTIAN am researching mosque hoping to run down funding .
5386	1406	What would you say if ASPECT_ISLAMIC_TERRORISTS were funding part of Mosque ?
5387	1406	You are rather insensitive .
5388	1406	Or maybe CHRISTIAN am misreading your ASPECT_POST please clarify POST ?
5389	1406	Yea and Mosque too ?
5390	1406	ASPECT_NEW_YORK_REPUBLICAN_PARTY is also said to be planning hostile ASPECT_TELEVISION_CAMPAIGN .
5391	1406	REPUBLICAN depends on how ASPECT_HOSTILE program is CHRISTIAN suppose .
5392	1406	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_bad ASPECT_STUFF .
5393	1406	CHRISTIAN ASPECT_FEAR that will get blown up or after THING built will happen .
5394	1406	CHRISTIAN just wish THEMSELVES would not put THEMSELVES and city ASPECT_FULL of people in harms ASPECT_WAY and build somewhere else .
5395	1406	see post one was over ten thousand ASPECT_LETTERS over limit !
5396	1406	end of ASPECT_PART_ONE !
5397	1407	ASPECT_PART_TWO !
5398	1407	If they are really evil motivated ASPECT_PEOPLE , again , THEY could be planning or preparing for anything .
5399	1407	I am not saying THEY are .
5400	1407	However I have been around block times and I have found that when ASPECT_PEOPLES_DEEDS do not match THEY ASPECT_WORDS is rotten in Denmark !
5401	1407	Too things do not make sense !
5402	1407	We will have to wait and see I suppose .
5403	1407	God help ASPECT_WE_WE are going to need BLOCK .
5404	1407	You have very strange ASPECT_WAY of thinking , not bad just ASPECT_STRANGE .
5405	1407	Absolutely no ASPECT_DISRESPECT meant !
5406	1407	However , if I was casually reading your ASPECT_POSTS I would think that ATHEIST were secular ASPECT_HUMANIST_ATHEIST .
5407	1407	Not immoral ASPECT_ATHEIST\/SH , but atheist nevertheless conservatives must think ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR was worthwhile .
5408	1407	I don and I do lean conservative .
5410	1407	Did you read I disclaimer ?
5411	1407	Where did I call Muslims ASPECT_IGNORANT ?
5412	1407	I hope is not your ASPECT_WORDS in I mouth !
5413	1407	Oh ASPECT_GOD will go to heaven ASPECT_AND who will not .
5414	1407	So if I were you I would not be throwing rocks cause you sure are living in ASPECT_GLASS_CRIB -LRB- ASPECT_HOUSE_-RRB- !
5415	1407	No s not what I said .
5416	1407	Muslims as well as Christians follow ASPECT_MUSLIMS_LEADERS .
5417	1407	I do not trust ASPECT_DEVELOPERS_ETC. .
5418	1407	ASPECT_GENERAL_POPULATION of Muslims are wonderful ASPECT_PEOPLE , which I have said over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over !
5419	1407	Even posting disclaimer !
5420	1407	Because DISCLAIMER being dedicated on 9\/11 being built on nearly on top if not on top of remains of victims , because funding is hidden and VICTIMS will not reveal DISCLAIMER , because of name of center .
5421	1407	And there is more .
5422	1407	Thanks for your ASPECT_REPLY and write soon !

5442	1411	Are you saying that model 1911 .45 caliber ASPECT_BULLET is as ASPECT_BROWNING_.50 ASPECT_BULLET ?
5443	1411	Not complete ASPECT_ROUND , but just bullet .
5444	1411	If so , you have n't clue about weapons at all , and are simply child ASPECT_TROLLING on site .
5445	1411	differences in bullets are , different ASPECT_DIAMETERS , different ASPECT_LENGTHS , different ASPECT_WEIGHTS , different ASPECT_SHAPES , and can not be fired from gun , either .45 , or .50 .
5446	1411	similarities are that they are both called bullets .
5447	1412	First , I wish you would learn how to post - would make lot easier to respond to you if you used conventional ASPECT_METHOD provided by PF .
5448	1412	And , to answer your ASPECT_QUESTION - No , QUESTION does n't make sense .
5449	1412	If you are lumping Muslims together as responsible for 9\/11 , then pray tell why in hell are we killing ASPECT_WE_SOLDIERS to provide `` ASPECT_MUSLIMS in Iraq with democracy .
5450	1412	is what does n't make sense .
5451	1412	ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_cheer and whoop ASPECT_MUSLIMS up 4000 ASPECT_+_SOLDIERS have given CONSERVATIVES lives to give Muslims in Iraq democracy and then whine , -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- and ASPECT_REVOLT over Muslims building community ASPECT_CENTER .
5452	1412	So , you blame `` ASPECT_MUSLIMS for what 19 ASPECT_AL-QAEDA_TERRORISTS did ?
5453	1412	figures .
5454	1412	Ignorance abounds .
5455	1412	ASPECT_SEPTEMBER_11 ASPECT_ATTACKS -LRB- often referred to as ASPECT_SEPTEMBER_11TH_or ASPECT_9\/11 -RRB- were series of ASPECT_COORDINATED_suicide ASPECT_ATTACKS by al-Qaeda upon ASPECT_UNITED_STATES on ASPECT_SEPTEMBER_11 , ASPECT_2001 .
5456	1412	On morning , 19 ASPECT_AL-QAEDA_TERRORISTS hijacked four commercial ASPECT_PASSENGER_JET_AIRLINERS .
5457	1412	So , are you suggesting that ASPECT_ISLAM_MOSQUE 's in US are dangerous and should be destroyed ?
5458	1412	Your ASPECT_COMMENT does n't make sense .
5459	1412	I think your ASPECT_COMMENTS are convoluted .
5460	1413	fact that you ignore antics of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , crazy ASPECT_WHACKO like ASPECT_SHARON_ANGLE and WHACKO off ASPECT_WALL_SUGGESTIONS , rantings of Palin and ASPECT_MICHELLE_BACHMANN and claim that ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is somehow answer to America problems is what is truly laughable .
5461	1413	way they bow at knee at mention of ANGLE ASPECT_NAME would make one ASPECT_WONDER .
5462	1413	Thank God , that it is not possible to bring GOD back , because , you may deny WAY , but I know lot of Teabaggers that worship ground GOD walks on .
5463	1413	near ASPECT_INSTANTANEOUS_GROWTH of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY after elections was because of `` fear and `` ASPECT_ANGER that `` black ASPECT_MAN was now at helm .
5464	1413	And ASPECT_INSTANTANEOUS_SUPPORT geared at Palin -LRB- ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_fave ASPECT_-RRB- , is another ASPECT_INDICATION that ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is not really interested in people who exercise frugality to reflect ASPECT_TEABAGGERS_CONSERVATISM , but rather in uses catchy ASPECT_PHRASES , ASPECT_MADE-UP_WORDS and does not practice conservatism in ASPECT_PEOPLE_LIFE .
5465	1413	Your ASPECT_RANTINGS are truly comical .
5466	1413	There is none more incompetent than Bush , and certainly McSame , who was not even able to tell state of economy when MCSAME was at point of collapse , nor BUSH ASPECT_CARIBOU_BARBIE who does n't even read ASPECT_NEWSPAPERS_and ASPECT_PRIDES SOMEONE on foreign ASPECT_POLICY because thinks can see Russia from back ASPECT_PORCH , can compare with Obama intelligence , eloquence and ASPECT_CAPABILITIES .
5467	1413	is dream of ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_FANATICS of Bush , because FANATICS would love for to replace Bozo in `` worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT_CATEGORY , unfortunately , MCSAME does n't look like MCSAME is going to happen .
5468	1413	Already , Obama has been given accolades that Bush does n't even know how to pronounce .
5469	1413	ASPECT_OBAMA_15TH_Greatest ASPECT_PRESIDENT_FUNNY that you should mention that , being Bozobush is known for having taken time off than president .
5470	1413	Vacationing Bush ASPECT_SETS_RECORD on Time Off would have been Bush , Obama staff continues to work when BUSH is on vacation .
5471	1413	RECORD is constant ASPECT_SNIPING and whining from `` ASPECT_RIGHT wears on BUSH , but BUSH is resilient enough to withstand that vitriol .
5472	1413	And even if we lose seats in November , which is normal for party of sitting ASPECT_PRESIDENT , WE will still have majority - and Reps\/cons will still be whining and crying and saying `` wait till election !
5473	1414	He is showing wear because HE is deeply lost .
5474	1414	In way over HE head .
5475	1414	HE 's so far out of HE capability HE does n't even realize CAPABILITY , and is confused that works .
5476	1414	And works because top , oBum , does n't know what HE is doing .
5477	1414	And HE gang of YES ASPECT_MEN_THUGS only know Chicago ASPECT_PAYOLA_and threats ASPECT_POLITICS .
5478	1414	Beyond THUGS ASPECT_HE gets unworkable ASPECT_IDEAS from ASPECT_UTOPIAN_DREAMLAND far left .
5479	1414	I 'd be surprised if HE is n't HAPPY to go in 2012 .
5480	1415	Another ASPECT_PERSON does n't know conventional ASPECT_WAY of posting !
5482	1415	You 've been listening to Faux ASPECT_NEWS too long .
5483	1415	Reps may take seats , but ASPECT_CZARS_doubt ASPECT_REPS will defeat .
5484	1415	of ASPECT_TEA_PARTIERS_CZARS have seen interviewed do n't know up from down , think ASPECT_GLENN_BECK should be president , ASPECT_CLAIM_BARACK_OBAMA is in Bible as `` ASPECT_ANTI-CHRIST , think Obama was to use ASPECT_TERM_`` ASPECT_CZARS , are in support of Medicare , want abolished - Watch video - you 'll see how really ignorant and ASPECT_DISCOMBOBULATED_ARE : YouTube - 9.12 ASPECT_DC_TEA_PARTY - MARCH FOOTAGE WITH ... works ?
5485	1415	BECK got ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE reformed passed , that neither ASPECT_HW_BUSH , nor Reagan , and certainly not Bozobush were able to accomplish .
5486	1415	Also , BECK passed ASPECT_FINANCE_REFORM .
5487	1415	BECK was able to get unemployment extended in spite of selfish ASPECT_REPUBLICANS who only want to give ASPECT_TAX_CUTS to wealthy .
5488	1415	So quit spewing lies , UNEMPLOYMENT makes your ASPECT_POST_LOOK_SUSPECT .
5489	1415	Now you are just venting venom and ASPECT_HATE because you have of substance to offer .
5490	1415	Republicans in Congress have shown where WEALTHY ASPECT_LOYALTIES lie , with very ASPECT_WEALTHY and corporations !
5491	1415	Are you contributing to ASPECT_BP_FUND - you know , one to help BP clean up mess ASPECT_CONTRIBUTING made so CONTRIBUTING wo n't have to spend of ASPECT_CONTRIBUTING_MILLIONS and have to cut bonuses for ASPECT_CONTRIBUTING_CEO ?
5492	1415	Your ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESSMEN would appreciate FUND if you would contribute .
5493	1416	Everything you post is obvious that it is what ASPECT_LEFT_WING_LIBERALS have brainwashed you into thinking .
5494	1416	you post shows original ASPECT_THOUGHT .
5495	1416	REPUBLICAN challenged you to GO and ASPECT_RESEARCH_and ASPECT_LEARN for yourself .
5496	1416	But instead you preach ASPECT_NYTIMES_or ASPECT_MSNBC_LINE about ASPECT_TEA_PARTY .
5497	1416	No ASPECT_PERSONAL_EXPERIENCE , no ASPECT_PERSONAL_KNOWLEDGE .
5498	1416	You are lost in your ASPECT_IDEOLOGY .
5499	1416	You continue to say things about ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE and about ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_FORMER_PRESIDENT .
5500	1416	Regardless of FACT that REPUBLICAN have informed you that REPUBLICAN am not Republican .
5501	1416	And REPUBLICAN did not vote for Bush .
5502	1416	You ask how to explain sign at ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_RALLY .
5504	1416	1 called free ASPECT_SPEECH .
5505	1416	Right or wrong , 1 free ASPECT_SPEECH .
5507	1416	there have been proven instances of liberals attending ASPECT_TEA_PARTY rallies to cause trouble and to show ignorant ASPECT_SIGNS .
5508	1416	But you do n't know since you will only believe what ASPECT_LEFTIST_PROPAGANDISTS tell you to believe .
5509	1416	But if you would go and SEE for yourself , you would see people displaying ASPECT_SLURRING_SIGNS being asked , in no uncertain ASPECT_TERMS to get out and stay out .
5510	1416	And PEOPLE get out and stand in front of liberal ASPECT_CAMERAS .
5511	1416	And ASPECT_PEOPLE_KNOW right where PEOPLE have liberal ASPECT_CAMERAS .
5512	1416	And seem to be on ASPECT_NAME_BASIS with liberal ASPECT_MEDIA_PEOPLE .
5513	1416	But smear ASPECT_CAMPAIGN will fail because liberals are up against aroused ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC .
5514	1416	Not ASPECT_SELF_serving ASPECT_IDEOLOGY .
5515	1417	Just shows you that ASPECT_HARRY_REID is just another ASPECT_CHAMELEON with no ASPECT_CONVICTIONS .
5516	1417	Yeah , and I already pointed out to you that of them do not want Mosque there either .
5517	1417	We 'll see about .
5518	1417	Dems believe that DEMS is living , breathing document .
5519	1417	Obama said DEMS was `` ASPECT_CHARTER of negative ASPECT_LIBERTIES .
5520	1417	If you think ASPECT_DEMS_RESPECT Constitution , you have n't been paying attention .
5521	1417	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is what American should support , unless you like big ASPECT_GOVERNMENT , bureaucracy , and taxes .
5522	1417	I guess you would re-elect Obama no matter how much that ASPECT_ONE-MAN_wrecking ASPECT_BALL is destroying country .
5523	1418	is ASPECT_INTENTIONAL_LIE .
5524	1418	Same as saying LIE is not community ASPECT_CENTER .
5525	1418	CENTER is community ASPECT_CENTER AND mosque .
5526	1418	So CENTER IS mosque .
5527	1418	Saying ASPECT_CENTER_NOT mosque , community ASPECT_CENTER is like saying Catholic ASPECT_CHURCH is ASPECT_BINGO_PARLOR .
5528	1418	Bingo gets played but is church , first and foremost .
5529	1418	And fiasco in NY is ASPECT_MOSQUE_, first and foremost .
5530	1420	is so true .
5531	1420	They wo n't campaign on HCR , bailouts , or stimulus , because THEY know none of THEY are popular with People .
5532	1420	just leaves what you mentioned : Bush ... oh , and racist ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT .
5533	1420	HOPE certainly hope THEY will not continue to campaign on `` ASPECT_HOPE_and ASPECT_CHANGE because we can see where is getting WE .
5534	1422	You just ca n't handle truth , so go ahead and do like ASPECT_REPS , hide under rock and believe what Faux ASPECT_NEWS tells you .
5535	1422	were members of your `` so-called ASPECT_HIGH_FALUTIN_TEA_PARTY expressing ASPECT_MEMBERS_DUMBNESS .
5536	1422	Sorry that you do n't see MEMBERS for what ASPECT_MEMBERS_ARE and try and tell FALUTIN that MEMBERS are informed Americans !
5538	1422	Yeah , ASPECT_YEAH , FALUTIN know .
5539	1422	of sudden ASPECT_PEOPLE that voted for Bush , do n't even know who ASPECT_BUSH is !
5540	1422	FALUTIN do n't blame you for trying to distance yourself from buffoon , BUFFOON really did n't do country good .
5541	1422	Sure ASPECT_COUNTRY free ASPECT_SPEECH , is why racists are able to carry RACISTS racist ASPECT_SIGNS and get free ASPECT_PASS from rest .
5542	1422	ASPECT_TYPICAL_REPUBLICAN\/CONSERVATIVE_RESPONSE - blame Democrats , RACISTS infiltrated ASPECT_PARTY_and ASPECT_RACISTS were ones with signs , right !
5543	1422	RACISTS ASPECT_CAPTURE_COUNTRY on video - FALUTIN do n't have to be there to see racist ASPECT_SIGNS_and RACISTS ASPECT_INTERVIEW_PEOPLE , so FALUTIN can then hear ASPECT_PEOPLE_`` lost ASPECT_LOOK_and dumb ASPECT_ANSWERS .
5544	1422	America is getting to see just how ASPECT_WHACKY Republicans have gotten .
5545	1422	Really - now RACISTS are telling RACISTS ASPECT_PEOPLE that Muslims are going to get RACISTS and kill RACISTS ASPECT_CHILDREN - like boogy-man !
5546	1422	Is that way you can get votes ?
5547	1423	Do you mean America has 60\/40 disapproval ASPECT_RATING against obama ?
5548	1423	That America .
5549	1423	Or 20 of Americans that trust Democrats ?
5550	1423	That America ?
5551	1423	ORAnd one is hilarious , America now sees 45 to 44 approval ASPECT_RATING of Bush over obie idiot .
5552	1423	That America ?
5553	1423	In USA we have 2 ASPECT_NEWSPAPER that lean ASPECT_RIGHT .
5554	1423	rest are very to extremely ASPECT_LEFTIST_AND do but run what amounts to commercials for liberal ASPECT_IDEAS .
5555	1423	WE have one ASPECT_TV_STATION that leans right , but does present side .
5556	1423	All rest of TV is exactly like ASPECT_LEFTIST_NEWSPAPERS .
5557	1423	On radio there are some right leaning to very right ASPECT_WING_TALK_SHOWS .
5558	1423	And can be said for left , there are more of them .
5559	1423	So in ASPECT_MEDIA_MATTERS left dominates communication by than 20 to ASPECT_1 .
5560	1423	Maybe ASPECT_100 to 1 .
5561	1423	Yet , America , does not believe bill of goods left is selling .
5562	1423	America hears your ASPECT_STORY_20 or ASPECT_TIMES for time they hear story from right , yet THEY ASPECT_SIDE with story from right .
5563	1423	Is right more convincing , or is right simply pointing out what intelligent ASPECT_NATION can see for NATION .
5564	1423	You want respect from America ?
5565	1423	Stop insulting ASPECT_THEY_INTELLIGENCE .
5566	1423	THEY can see stupidity and ASPECT_UNSUSTAINABILITY of your liberalism ASPECT_BETTER than you can .
5567	1424	If your ASPECT_OPINION is based on following , I would suggest you stop reading FOX Nation and stop watching FOX News .
5568	1424	Read ASPECT_NEWS_PAPERS or ASPECT_FACT-CHECKING_WEBSITES .
5569	1424	Turn off ASPECT_CABLE_NEWS .
5570	1424	He is less than half ASPECT_WAY into HE term and has already kept or compromised on 160 .
5571	1424	81 are stalled either due to ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_OBSTRUCTIONISM -LRB- ASPECT_RECORD_FILLIBUSTERS -RRB- or ASPECT_VARIOUS_REASONS .
5572	1424	majority are in works , and 22 have been outright broken .
5573	1424	You lied .
5574	1424	SOURCE : ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.POLITIFACT.COM\/TRUTH-O-METER\/PROMISES\/_WWW.RECOVERY.GOVWWW.WHITEHOUSE.GOVE_TC , etc. .
5575	1424	I have never seen so ASPECT_INFORMATION been made open to public by administration .
5576	1424	is matter of opinion , and I get feeling judging by tone of your ASPECT_PREVIOUS_POSTS that anything administration does will not please you .
5577	1424	Oh really ?
5578	1424	I guess never ASPECT_HAPPENED , then ?
5579	1424	I guess ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY I get check is just ASPECT_FIGMENT of I imagination ?
5580	1424	I guess credit when I filed I income tax year was illusion ?
5581	1424	You lie .
5582	1424	Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS_SUN-SETTING will not raise taxes on ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS under Democrat proposed ASPECT_PLAN .
5583	1424	SUN-SETTING will only raise taxes on individuals grossing over 200,000 or ASPECT_FAMILIES grossing over 250,000 .
5584	1424	Do your ASPECT_HOMEWORK .
5585	1424	Also , stop lying .
5586	1424	Saying LYING going to raise taxes on everyone is but your wistful ASPECT_THINKING .
5587	1424	Do n't peddle THINKING as fact .
5589	1424	LYING has actually cut useless or wasteful ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_PROGRAMS in order to save billion ASPECT_DOLLARS here and there .
5590	1424	I think you 're mistaking Obama with Bush .
5591	1424	Also , stop lying .
5592	1424	Popular ASPECT_OPINION is fickle and changes depending on who is better at communicating message .
5593	1424	Republicans are notoriously good at doing so through emotionally ASPECT_CHARGE_rhetoric and ASPECT_PROPAGANDA .
5594	1424	of us -LRB- I included -RRB- rely on facts to form US opinions rather than rhetoric , so while you may disagree -LRB- for whatever ASPECT_REASON -RRB- with cost-saving ASPECT_MEASURES such as ASPECT_INSURANCE_REFORM , are right to do both morally and financially .
5595	1424	Yet again ... what hell ?
5596	1424	ICE has actually deported people under Obama than PEOPLE did under Bush , and Obama has only been in office for year and half .
5597	1424	Where are you getting your `` ASPECT_FACTS from ?
5598	1424	Far too vague for I to argue against .
5599	1424	Far too vague for I to argue against .
5601	1424	While HIM is n't anything like reincarnation of ASPECT_FRANKLIN_DELANO_ROOSEVELT that I was hoping for , I will certainly vote for him over Republicans ASPECT_FIELD , unless ASPECT_TEDDY_ROOSEVELT_REPUBLICAN comes out of woodwork .
5602	1426	ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_PROMISE has been filled you know ... according to clowns in Whitehouse we are pulling out of recession .
5603	1426	CLOWNS have ASPECT_CLOWNS_HEADS so far in sand with ears plugged saying Lalalala .
5604	1426	I ca n't hear you America .
5606	1427	Technically , they are correct .
5607	1427	Until we see negative ASPECT_GDP_GROWTH for than 2 ASPECT_QUARTERS in row , THEY will continue to assert as ASPECT_WELL .
5608	1427	But with ASPECT_CALCULATIONS_CHANGES for unemployment as well as change from GNP to GDP to track economy , figures have been much more forgiving for feds to report figures to ASPECT_GENERAL_PUBLIC .
5609	1427	Still , does n't help public at all .
5610	1429	Maybe you need to expand your ASPECT_KNOWLEDGE , and turn on ASPECT_CABLE_NEWS and listen to talk radio .
5611	1429	You only get warm ASPECT_FUZZIES from MSM .
5612	1429	Obstructing Obama is good .
5613	1429	OBAMA has been forced to be more transparent , but OBAMA did n't start off way as promised .
5614	1429	Just wait until 1\/1\/2011 , at which ASPECT_TIME_TAXES will be raised for everyone to cover HCR .
5615	1429	ASPECT_TAX_BRACKETS_INCREASE .
5616	1429	OBAMA ASPECT_SPENDING dwarfs cuts .
5617	1429	Assuming goes well and stays on track ?
5619	1429	deficits from Obama will be history-making .
5620	1429	Obamacare was against wishers of People .
5621	1429	want LOL repealed now .
5622	1429	No ASPECT_THANKS to Obama .
5623	1434	ASPECT_TYPICAL_liberal ASPECT_REASONING .
5624	1434	Does n't really have ASPECT_MEANING_or ASPECT_SUBSTANCE .
5625	1434	There I fixed it for you .
5626	1435	Remember whole banning lobbyist from Admin ?
5627	1435	did n't even last 1 ASPECT_DAY .
5629	1436	ASPECT_TYPICAL_liberal ASPECT_REASONING .
5630	1436	Does n't really have ASPECT_MEANING_or ASPECT_SUBSTANCE .
5631	1436	Are you trying to have reasonable and meaningful ASPECT_CONVERSATION with me ?
5632	1436	Maybe you 're trying to ask ME why ME like Obama .
5633	1436	Or maybe CONVERSATION that you 're puzzled by thinking YOU would most ASPECT_LIKELY_VOTE for YOU like now .
5634	1437	I wanna know how he can take credit for combat ASPECT_TROOPS leaving Iraq .
5635	1437	Troops are Troops .
5636	1437	Engineer , ASPECT_INTEL_ANALYST , Civic ASPECT_AFFAIRS , JAG or whatever still goes to Boot ASPECT_CAMP and learns ASPECT_FORM_BASIC_combat ASPECT_SKILLS .
5637	1437	GOES have to or GOES do n't get deployed .
5638	1437	But 's not even crux of INTEL .
5639	1437	's changed is ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_DOD retitled ASPECT_BRIGADE_Combat ASPECT_TEAMS to `` advisory and assistance ASPECT_BRIGADES .
5640	1437	troops still in Iraq will still be in combat when TROOPS go on missions with ASPECT_IRAQI_TROOPS .
5641	1437	Doubt information ?
5642	1437	Read up on ASPECT_2\/25TH -LRB- 2nd ASPECT_STRYKER_BRIDGE , ASPECT_25TH_INF_DIVISION -RRB- and ASPECT_TROOPS_recent ASPECT_DEPLOYMENT to FOB ASPECT_WARHORSE .
5643	1437	Obama has lied
5644	1439	You 'll never hear Obama say OBAMA taking ASPECT_CREDIT for it .
5645	1439	CREDIT must have been Fox ASPECT_NEWS_CONTRIBUTER fed you that info .
5646	1440	I would like to know why you like him ... What has HIM done that you like ?
5647	1441	Making UNPOPULAR ASPECT_DECISIONS .
5648	1442	's sort of what I was thinking .
5649	1444	He is not making unpopular ASPECT_DECISIONS .
5650	1444	HE is making ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_DECISIONS do not and have not worked .
5651	1444	decisions are unpopular because people do not share HE rigid ASPECT_IDEOLOGY see them as stupid ASPECT_DECISIONS .
5652	1444	Like spending way to prosperity on borrowed ASPECT_MONEY .
5653	1444	Or , `` are going to win ASPECT_AFGHAN_WAR and leave year .
5655	1444	If he was not both driven ASPECT_AND bound by HE ideology , HE would react to problems instead of pushing old , old , tired ASPECT_PROGRAM .
5656	1444	Once again ASPECT_NIGHT , in HE speech , HE philosophizes with no ASPECT_SPECIFICS , and then promotes , ASPECT_REGULATION_, education ASPECT_REFORM , and cap and ASPECT_TRADE .
5657	1444	regulation = taxes ON EVERYONE .
5658	1444	Reform ASPECT_EDUCATION = taxes on everyone .
5659	1444	Cap and ASPECT_TRADE = taxes on everyone .
5660	1444	In case you have n't broken his ASPECT_CODE .
5661	1445	Well Dan , instead of pointing finger , post your ASPECT_IDEAS ?
5662	1445	We 're so quick to point ASPECT_FINGER_& rack up ASPECT_POINTS , but WE have no ASPECT_FVCKING_CLUE on how to fix things .
5663	1446	Hundreds of ideas have been offered , by me , by others .
5664	1446	But HUNDREDS are contrary to his rigid , ASPECT_UNCHANGEABLE_, ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_POSITION .
5665	1446	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_DEBATE on TV was prime ASPECT_LIVING_EXAMPLE .
5666	1446	Obama calls for ASPECT_OPEN_CONFERENCE on ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_reform ASPECT_IDEAS .
5667	1446	Even ASPECT_DAY before conference OBAMA is publicly saying Republican are party of NO. .
5668	1446	's on EVE of ` ASPECT_COMPROMISE_' ASPECT_CONFERENCE OBAMA asks for .
5669	1446	Then in OBAMA dismisses out of ASPECT_HAND_IDEA put forth .
5670	1446	No ASPECT_ASSESSMENT of merit or ASPECT_LACK , just does n't fit ASPECT_OBAMA_GOAL .
5671	1446	OBAMA also insults crippled wounded combat ASPECT_AMERICAN_HERO in completely hateful and arrogant ASPECT_MANNER .
5672	1446	OBAMA also states that although OBAMA will not use ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_IDEAS , OBAMA will no longer say that they do not have ideas .
5673	1446	ASPECT_DAY_OBAMA says , Republicans do not have ideas .
5674	1446	OBAMA has no ASPECT_CLUE how to negotiate anything .
5675	1446	In ASPECT_MULTIPLE_SITUATIONS OBAMA has either acted in ASPECT_KNEE-JERK_FASHION without waiting for ASPECT_FULL_INFORMATION , or has not reacted at when ASPECT_OBAMA needed to .
5676	1446	, capable ASPECT_EXECUTIVE , knows when to act and when to hold back .
5677	1446	OBAMA gets ASPECT_FASHION_wrong both ASPECT_WAYS .
5678	1446	There are very strict ASPECT_PROTOCOLS of what to do and what to say and how to say FASHION when dealing with Governments .
5679	1446	ASPECT_OBAMA_IGNORES advice of ASPECT_STATE_DEPT. and does whatever ASPECT_OBAMA wishes , as OBAMA wishes .
5680	1446	result is constant ASPECT_MIXED_and confused ASPECT_MESSAGE being sent to both ASPECT_FRIENDS_and ASPECT_ENEMIES .
5681	1446	And ALWAYS , confusion is seen as weakness by both friend and ASPECT_FOE .
5682	1448	Ah but I think you fail to see his true ASPECT_COLORS !
5683	1448	HIS has abandoned legal ASPECT_WORKING_MIDDLE_CLASS of Americans completely knowing HIS has lost US by HIS broken ASPECT_PROMISES and forcing HIS ASPECT_AGENDA upon us such as disliked ASPECT_ATROCITY called ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PLAN .
5684	1448	Anyway look at who ASPECT_HIS is befriending !
5685	1448	illegal ASPECT_ALIENS which means ASPECT_HISPANIC_voting ASPECT_BLOCK .
5686	1448	And of course black voting ASPECT_BLOCK .
5687	1448	I beleive that is ASPECT_CALCULATED_STRATEGY and one will fail because votes are not there .
5688	1448	I used to beleive as you until I began realizing that HISPANIC was ignoring wishes of voters over and over so ASPECT_TIMES I began asking I why is HISPANIC doing ?
5689	1448	So no ASPECT_HISPANIC is playing ASPECT_HISPANIC_ACE in hole and giving VOTERS ASPECT_EVERYTHING_VOTERS want in desperate ASPECT_HOPE that VOTERS will win ASPECT_HISPANIC_REELECTION_IMO .
5691	1449	aEXCERPT ; Yes HE too wish we as nation were as loved as WE supposedly were in ASPECT_EARLY_60 .
5692	1449	HE read book from era was entitled how to go around world on pound of pot and backpack .
5693	1449	ASPECT_HA_HA was before Nam had really been in living ASPECT_ROOMS for long enough to poison world against WE JFK was in ASPECT_OFFICE_and ASPECT_EVERYONE seemed to love ASPECT_WE_or ASPECT_SO was what HE have been told .
5694	1449	But then Nam lasted ten ASPECT_YEARS then there was bad ASPECT_THINGS including CIA in ASPECT_SOUTH_AMERICA and ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST_WARS .
5695	1449	HE too thought Obama might change .
5696	1449	But no he has been disappointment because man is about MAN .
5697	1449	MAN only wants ASPECT_MAN_VISION of what MAN thinks USA should be , which seems to be semi or totally socialist ASPECT_COUNTRY where everyone is dependent on government .
5698	1449	No ASPECT_OBAMA is toxic .
5699	1449	HE beleive that man is threat to survival of nation .
5700	1449	HE could explain why ASPECT_MAN_trillion ASPECT_DOLLAR here and trillion ASPECT_DOLLAR there plans of flushing good ASPECT_MONEY after bad will probably stop feeble ASPECT_RECOVERY and maybe force into depression which will have world ASPECT_WIDE_CONSEQUENCES .
5701	1449	If USA really crashes in 1920s ASPECT_STYLE_DEPRESSION -LRB- USA will be worse really -RRB- world will crash with .
5702	1449	And then will really be hated !
5703	1449	\*\*\* -LRB- nervous ASPECT_HA ha ... -RRB- \*\*\* please forgive dark ASPECT_HUMOR ... ?

5724	1450	After parsing thru rant , ME did n't see one ASPECT_IDEA proposed in there on how Dan would have fixed things .
5725	1450	Did else ?
5727	1451	So he did n't sit in ASPECT_OVAL_OFFICE talking about it night ?

5761	1463	I do n't have great ASPECT_DEAL of faith in politician no ASPECT_MATTER what ASPECT_PARTY_AFFILIATION they claim .
5762	1463	But Republicans have put forth ASPECT_DOZENS of suggestions since oBum took power .
5763	1463	But liberal ASPECT_MINDSET is that if suggestion , or plan , does not fit DOZENS liberal ASPECT_IDEOLOGY , not only is SUGGESTION ignored .
5764	1463	DOZENS ignore MINDSET so completely , DOZENS act like , and CLAIM , that no ASPECT_SUGGESTIONS were ever offered .
5765	1464	's because , without exception , crap have offered amounts to simply of tired ass ASPECT_CRAP got us into mess US have now .
5766	1464	problem with conservative ASPECT_IDEOLOGY is that thinking for oneself is sin and ASPECT_ANYTHING says otherwise is deemed ASPECT_SOCIALISM_and ASPECT_EVIL .
5767	1464	See ^ ASPECT_^_^ ^ I can play stupid broad ASPECT_GENERALIZATION_GAME too .
5768	1465	I rest I case !
5769	1465	Here is person can not name suggestions not proposed by liberal .
5770	1465	And still backs liberal ASPECT_SUGGESTIONS even tho in about 2 ASPECT_YEARS -LRB- 4 ASPECT_YEARS if you start with Democrat controlled Congress in 2007 -RRB- NONE of liberal ASPECT_EFFORTS have done anything but fail and waste money .
5771	1466	Just because it happens on his ASPECT_WATCH , does n't mean HIS is taking credit for IT .
5772	1466	HIS ASPECT_SIMPLY announced that ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR has ended .
5773	1466	's WAR .
5774	1466	had to make announcement , right ?
5776	1466	If . had n't made ASPECT_PUBLIC_ANNOUNCEMENT , you 'd be flaming . for too .
5777	1466	You just need reason to keep hating . .
5778	1466	In my ASPECT_MIND , no ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION can fix problems .
5779	1466	MY predict that one fans will be pointing FANS ASPECT_FINGERS at Obama for why FANS ca n't fix FANS either .
5780	1467	Wow , where do you have your ASPECT_TENT set up ?
5781	1467	You are ASPECT_PYSCHIC_fortune ASPECT_READER right ?
5782	1467	After , you arrogance to assume you know everything about me and ASPECT_ME_POLITICS on basis of two short ASPECT_POSTS .
5783	1467	Never mind , IDEOLOGUE are ideologue and as not worth ASPECT_TIME or ASPECT_EFFORT_TIME would take to educate you .
5784	1468	You bob and weave well , , , obvious , but well .
5785	1469	administration with ASPECT_OPEN_MIND and balls to do MIND could fix problems .
5786	1469	MIND would be painful for and ASPECT_SO for politicians when problems are shown to be ASPECT_POLITICIANS_FAULT .
5787	1469	But NO , no ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION will fix anything by following POLITICIANS ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_PREJUDICE .
5788	1470	Dems have plenty of fault to take blame for in getting us in mess also .
5789	1470	So far , I have not seen anything from ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION that gives US glimmer of ASPECT_HOPE_or ASPECT_CHANGE on horizon .
5790	1470	Obama is spending US into oblivion .
5791	1470	OBAMA `` Summer Of Recovery is big ASPECT_JOKE , and just wait until year when ASPECT_TAXES_INCREASE .
5792	1470	If OBAMA gets OBAMA ASPECT_WAY with Cap & ASPECT_TRADE and Amnesty , US 're in for hurt .
5793	1470	Obama is just too stupid to see ASPECT_OBAMA_destructive ASPECT_WAYS .
5794	1470	I really believe OBAMA thinks OBAMA right in what OBAMA is doing .
5795	1470	I do n't know what ASPECT_PLAYBOOK_OBAMA is using , but OBAMA had better ASPECT_CLOSE_PLAYBOOK and look at cover .
5796	1471	I completely agree .
5797	1471	And is why , even though at heart I disagree with liberal ASPECT_POSITIONS , I am not in favor of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY regaining power anytime soon .
5798	1471	I like ASPECT_SHAKEUP_EFFECT ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is having on republicans and I think party would benefit from stewing in REPUBLICANS -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- while longer .
5799	1471	Maybe then , when REPUBLICANS start listening to ASPECT_REPUBLICANS_CONSTITUENTS again and start looking after interests of America rather than just lining CONSTITUENTS pockets , REPUBLICANS will be worth voting for again .
5800	1471	Until then , I am likely to vote for ASPECT_OBAMA_again ASPECT_AS -LRB- as I stated in post just little ASPECT_WAYS back in here very ASPECT_THREAD -RRB- lesser of two ASPECT_EVILS .
5801	1471	And no , I have not seen anything put forth by republicans lately was really worth ASPECT_CONSIDERATION .
5802	1471	REPUBLICANS seem to have based REPUBLICANS strategy on doing and saying whatever ASPECT_REPUBLICANS think will ASPECT_OBSTRUCT and\/or tear down ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY .
5803	1471	When REPUBLICANS start acting in America interests rather than ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY interests , REPUBLICANS might become relevant again .
5804	1472	I have never absolved democrats of blame .
5805	1472	I just find it extremely hypocritical of republicans to claim democrats are solely responsible for mess country is in and particulary hilariously hypocritical why DEMOCRATS claim to be more fiscally responsible .
5806	1473	Why do you say ?
5807	1474	We know mess is fault of , including ASPECT_FOLKS on sides of aisle .
5808	1474	ASPECT_BARNEY_FRANK is big ASPECT_CULPRIT , since FRANK was made aware of problems with ASPECT_FREDDIE_and ASPECT_FANNIE_SEVERAL_YEARS ago , but FRANK said were `` ASPECT_SOUND_financial ASPECT_INSTITUTIONS .
5809	1474	Boy was FRANK ASPECT_WRONG .
5810	1474	Also , `` fiscal ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY and `` politicians is like `` oil and `` water .
5811	1474	However , it is very clear that Dems and ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION are spending ASPECT_MONEY_POLITICIANS do n't have like DEMS grows on trees , or is being printed at BEP at ASPECT_RECORD_RATE .
5812	1476	ummm ... czars ?
5813	1476	Firing ASPECT_AUTO CEO 's from ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE and handing over ownership of company to union ?
5814	1477	Obama never planned on fixing anything for America .
5815	1477	ASPECT_OBAMA_PRIORITIES are redistribution of wealth , reparations domestically and internationally , implementing tenets of socialism , and helping ASPECT_MUSLIM_WORLD to expand .
5816	1477	If anything , chaos and ASPECT_PROBLEMS within America make CHAOS ASPECT_EASIER to slide things through , and OBAMA about , not making America stronger and less ASPECT_LIKELY to accept ASPECT_OBAMA_PRIORITIES .
5817	1478	's exactly why maintain that he is destructive for America , HE is anything but ASPECT_AMERICAN_, and HE must not be re-elected .
5818	1479	Here 's ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_ALTERNATIVE : http:\/\/republicanwhip.house.gov\/Jobs\/Pander to electorate .
5819	1479	Cut ASPECT_TAXES , run up ASPECT_DEBT .

5821	1479	But pass ASPECT_BUCK_GENERATION will lap PASS up .
5822	1480	's as irresponsible ASPECT_QUOTE as DITCH have seen in conservative ASPECT_DEAD-HEAD_THREAD .
5823	1480	DITCH can quote again and again irresponsible ASPECT_MACHINATIONS that Republicans have thrust upon since Saint ASPECT_RONNIE_REAGAN and come to fruition under ASPECT_BRATBOY_BUSH , and not one ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE here or elsewhere will admit to and utter ASPECT_FAILURE of `` trickle down ASPECT_WAR_ECONOMICS put in ASPECT_DEEP_ECONOMIC_`` ASPECT_DITCH 're now in .

5828	1480	ASPECT_SHARRON_ANGLE is so intolerant , temperate ASPECT_MEN would lament that she needs to get laid .
5829	1480	ASPECT_MICHELLE_BACHMAN could use good ASPECT_LAY as well .
5830	1480	Even Saint ASPECT_RONNIE_REAGAN would balk at ASPECT_INTEMPERATE_RHETORIC two twisted ASPECT_WITCHES spew from ASPECT_WITCHES_BREW !
5831	1480	Macbeth would shy from ASPECT_WITCHES_ACID laced tonic .

5833	1480	Talk about minion on Satan team !
5834	1480	SATAN demented ASPECT_ECONOMIC_IDEOLOGY is what got us into 2 ASPECT_ILL-BEGOTTEN_WARS and depression near equal of was kicked off by ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET_CRASH in 1929 .
5835	1480	-LRB- If US do n't pay attention to history , US are doomed to repeat IDEOLOGY ! -RRB-
5836	1480	Obama has been in office less than 2 ASPECT_YEARS and OBAMA supposed to clean up ASPECT_GODAWFUL_mess ASPECT_YEARS took Republicans 6 ASPECT_YEARS and 2 ASPECT_WARS to destroy economy and morale of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE .
5837	1480	Now Republicans want voters to give VOTERS keys to economy once again to send jobs to China , force Americans to die rather than get needed ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and make sure that quality ASPECT_EDUCATION goes only to who can pay for EDUCATION , like ASPECT_VOTERS_BILLIONAIRE_CRONIES .
5838	1480	Call Un-American ?
5839	1480	You bet !!!
5840	1480	!!! 's about as UN-American as !!! gets .

5842	1480	Not in lifetime , so long as Republicans can deprive us of `` dream !
5843	1480	in order to line pockets with gold from Chinese Communist ASPECT_BANKS .
5844	1480	Will DITCH vote for Obama in 2010 .

5854	1481	CONSTITUTION ASPECT_NOT like bailout was given in time of prosperity .
5855	1481	If there was n't problem we would n't be talking about .
5856	1481	About bailouts -LRB- starting with Bush in 2008 -RRB- if you 're concerned about ASPECT_HOMELAND_SECURITY , WE are in middle of war on fronts : would allowing chips fall where they may be smart to do for country ?
5857	1481	And how would affect ASPECT_ENDLESS_WAYS ASPECT_WE_INTERACT with rest of world ?
5858	1481	Giving ASPECT_TAX_PAYER_MONEY without conditions and management of what happens with money -LRB- who where and what ASPECT_MONEY goes to -RRB- does n't make sense .

5863	1485	You talk of `` pass ASPECT_BUCK_GENERATION ?
5864	1485	Well , Obama is creating `` pass buck to generation .
5865	1486	Obama restarted ASPECT_PAYGO_PROGRAM .
5866	1486	Obama is talking about raising taxes after economy is recovered .
5867	1486	Obama reformed ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_SYSTEM to save us hundreds of billions .
5868	1486	And Obama is ending ASPECT_MONEY_PIT is ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR .
5869	1486	OBAMA doing great ASPECT_THINGS for deficit .
5870	1486	reason deficit is as high as DEFICIT is now is because REASON costs lot of money to fix mess so called ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES left .
5871	1487	You should put warning ASPECT_LABEL on your ASPECT_POSTS .
5872	1487	`` Too ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE and rational ASPECT_THOUGHT may cause cons ASPECT_HEADS to explode .
5873	1488	So far , no ASPECT_ATTEMPT has been made to `` paygo .

5881	1488	Democrat ASPECT_CANDIDATES for Nov. are avoiding mention of ASPECT_BHO_or ASPECT_OBAMACARE .
5882	1488	ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR is but small ASPECT_FRACTION of budget and difference between `` ASPECT_MISSION_ACCOMPLISHED , and `` Combat is over , is ASPECT_WORD_CHOICE only .
5883	1488	mission was not accomplished and combat is NOT over in Iraq .
5884	1488	And blaming EXCUSE on guy is completely worn out EXCUSE .
5885	1488	And EXCUSE is purely EXCUSE for lack of accomplishment on BHO part .
5886	1488	And what has BHO done for deficit ?
5887	1488	BHO HAS ASPECT_INCREASED_NATIONAL_DEBT ASPECT_BY_2.81 ASPECT_TRILLION in less than 2 ASPECT_YEARS with BHO , and Democrat controlled Congress , insane deficit ASPECT_SPENDING .
5888	1489	Obama started ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENTIAL_CAREER with 1.2 trillion ASPECT_DOLLAR_DEFICIT .
5889	1489	latest ASPECT_PREDICTION is that 2010 ASPECT_DEFICIT will be 1.3 ASPECT_TRILLION .
5890	1489	's 100 billion ASPECT_DOLLAR_RISE in deficit .
5891	1489	Which is astonishingly low considering economy and unavoidable ASPECT_RISE in deficits happens in recession due to increased welfare ASPECT_COSTS .
5892	1489	http:\/\/www.salon.com\/news\/feature\/20...dget_deficit_1In comparison by time in Bush ASPECT_PRESIDENCY_BUSH raised deficit by 200 ASPECT_BILLION and BUSH was n't in recession .
5893	1489	In words ... republicans are giant ASPECT_HYPOCRITES .
5894	1490	unemployment has not be rising for 14 ASPECT_STRAIGHT_MONTHS .

5897	1492	HIS has no constitutional ASPECT_AUTHORITY whatsoever to do anything with daily ASPECT_OPERATIONS or ownership of ASPECT_PRIVATE_CORPORATION .
5898	1492	Yet HIS gave ownership to ASPECT_UNION_DONORS , fired CEO that answers only to ASPECT_PRIVATE_BOARD , and made decisions on which dealerships to close directly from ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE , favoring ASPECT_SUPPORTERS_and ASPECT_DEMS .
5899	1492	Your ASPECT_EXCUSES for are mind-numbing .
5900	1492	essentially illegal , and without Pelosi , Reid , and ASPECT_DEM_MAJORITY , impeachment would not be unrealistic .
5901	1492	ASPECT_REID_and ASPECT_HOLDER have no constitutional ASPECT_AUTHORITY to stop legal ASPECT_ACTIONS against club wielding thugs at voting ASPECT_PRECINCT .

5906	1494	Play !!! again , Sam !!!
5907	1495	ASPECT_DR._OBAMA has never done anything unconstitutional .
5908	1495	ASPECT_OBAMA_COHORTS in ASPECT_LEGISLATIVE_BRANCH however continually find ways to violate Article 1 ASPECT_SECTION_8 of USC .
5909	1495	is why we are in ASPECT_ECONOMIC_MESS today .
5910	1496	I volunteer to take one for team and sleep with ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN .
5911	1497	Oh , ASPECT_WE_SWEETIE_PIE_TEA_PARTY_ENTHUSIAST , just like Mad ASPECT_HATTER and in spite of your obvious ASPECT_PARANOIA , we `` love SPITE when you talk dirty !
5912	1497	needs !!!!
5913	1498	Your ASPECT_REJOINDER is claim by ASPECT_LEFT_WING_WEBSITE that he has 1.3 ASPECT_TRILLION_DEFICIT ??
5914	1498	If Bush $ 1,2 trillion deficit was bad , AND BAD CERTAINLY ASPECT_WAS , how in hell is obummers 1.3 trillion deficit ASPECT_GOOD ?
5915	1498	And please , do n't claim DEFICIT Republican fault .
5916	1498	lamo EXCUSE is totally worn out , and fact is Democrats have been IN CHARGE since ASPECT_JAN._2007 .
5917	1498	Republicans ASPECT_WERE_AWFUL , and were REPLACED in ASPECT_NOV._2006 ASPECT_ELECTIONS and Dems sworn in in ASPECT_JAN_2007 .
5918	1498	Or did n't you know .
5919	1498	So truly awful ASPECT_REPUBLICANS -LRB- no ASPECT_DISAGREEMENT there -RRB- were replaced by Democrats who HAVE DONE WORSE !
5920	1498	Pelosi , and Reid have been in CONGRESS for 20 ASPECT_+_YEARS and Biden even longer .
5921	1498	What were they doing ?
5922	1498	We NEED to dump career , and corrupt -LRB- -RRB- politicians of both ASPECT_PARTIES .
5923	1498	Republicans deserved to be replaced , AND WERE .
5924	1498	Now Democrats are even ASPECT_DESERVING of being thrown out .
5925	1498	Sadly that leaves Republicans to take Democrats ASPECT_PLACE , and POLITICIANS are looking LESS ASPECT_EVIL than Dems .
5926	1498	Both are BAD !
5927	1499	Pay her ASPECT_ENOUGH and HER 'll gladly accommodate seeking ASPECT_HER_FAVOR .
5928	1499	Just guard against STDs !
5929	1500	You wanna know why 1.3 ASPECT_TRILLION is good ?
5930	1500	because when we had surplus ASPECT_G.W. cut taxes , increased ASPECT_SPENDING , and took machete to regulations .
5931	1500	When Obama took office right after http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?gl=IE&amp;h...&amp;v=mEkY7_i7MJs .
5932	1500	Now , instead of raising taxes when WE had surplus and economy was good , SURPLUS was thrown away , dribbled into haliburton and banks .
5933	1500	Because Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUT for rich expired 1.4 ASPECT_YEARS into Obama term , it was meant to make BUSH ASPECT_LOOK like BUSH was raising taxes in time in recession when in fact it was just ASPECT_PLOY to make ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PRESIDENT , whoever ASPECT_CUT was look bad , because even ASPECT_BUSH knew after ASPECT_HAVIC_BUSH knew BUSH 'd create no ASPECT_REPUBLICAN would take office after HAVIC .
5934	1500	So is ASPECT_OBAMA_PERFECT ?
5936	1500	Was OBAMA dealt bad ASPECT_HAND ?
5937	1500	yes , YES had no ASPECT_WHERE but down to go , and without spending for stimulous we 'd keep going down .
5938	1500	Is Obama doing what truly needs to be done to fix ASPECT_WE_broken ASPECT_SYSTEM of government feeding rich who ASPECT_GAMLE_WE_MONEY away ?
5939	1500	no , but honestly OBAMA think republicans would be even worse , historically speaking than man in office now .
5940	1501	Maybe you have point .
5941	1501	But , just `` ASPECT_MAYBE .
5942	1501	If BOTH are BAD , what 's your ASPECT_SOLUTION ?
5943	1501	Another ASPECT_PARTY ?
5944	1501	I 'll buy , but who do you recommend ?
5945	1501	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY ?
5946	1501	Not even ASPECT_OSAMA_bin ASPECT_LADEN would finance group of rattlesnakes -LRB- Do n't tread on I ! -RRB-
5947	1501	and LADEN has incentive to do so since electing them is as ASPECT_ELECTING_LADEN .
5948	1501	Sorry , dog wo n't hunt !
5949	1501	Seriously , if Republicans could muster `` ASPECT_AMERICAN_CANDIDATE , as Independent , I might vote for him\/her .
5950	1501	But , THEM got no ASPECT_ONE !
5951	1501	Republicans do is whine , complain , lie and say , `` NO !
5952	1501	Them 's facts , ASPECT_DANNY_BOY .
5953	1501	Them 's facts !
5954	1501	They shot THEY in foot with ASPECT_BRATBOY_BUSH -- or should I cite Cheney as shooter ?
5955	1501	Now , THEY can do is hobble around on crutches blaming Obama for ASPECT_THEY_INABILITY to run marathon without ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_HELP .
5956	1501	Ohhhhhhhh , pain of NOW !
5957	1502	There is no ASPECT_TEA_PARTY like Democrat ASPECT_PARTY or ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY .
5958	1502	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is misnomer taken from Boston ASPECT_TEA_PARTY of history .

6010	1518	ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH !!!
6011	1518	Since ASPECT_JANUARY_2007 , PARTY has been ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY in control of ASPECT_CONGRESS_AND ASPECT_SPENDING .
6012	1519	Obama is not following ASPECT_PAYGO_PROGRAM .
6013	1519	Obama wants to raise taxes now , before ASPECT_ECONOMY_RECOVERS , Obamacare will do anything but save money , and OBAMA is doing things to increase deficit .
6014	1519	has happened so far will save us money , was draw-down of Iraq .
6015	1519	However , of expense is just being shifted to Afghanistan .
6016	1519	reason deficit is getting so high , is because ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_OBAMA_DEMOCRATIC_GOONS are spending US into oblivion .
6018	1521	of ASPECT_CURRENT_DEFICIT came from programs were started prior to 2007 .
6019	1521	Like ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR and Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
6020	1522	's not good .
6021	1522	still bad .
6022	1522	IS good is that he is moving up at slower ASPECT_RATE and is passing policies will eventually drive deficit down .
6023	1522	I gaurantee ... mark I word ... that 2011 deficit will be lower than 1.2 ASPECT_TRILLION HE started with .
6024	1522	Because ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_POLICIES and ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_POLICIES lower deficit .
6025	1522	If you want deficit is higher than 1.2 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS then vote Republican in 2010 and ASPECT_2012 .
6026	1522	Because 's republicans are good for .
6027	1523	Obama has not proposed program of raising taxes before recovery is over .
6028	1524	He 's letting Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS expire .
6029	1524	HE may agree to keep them in place for ASPECT_MIDDLE_AMERICA , however , but small ASPECT_BUSINESS will suffer .
6030	1524	ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES come into play on 1\/1\/2011 ASPECT_DUE to Obamacare .
6031	1524	Cap & ASPECT_TRADE : ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES , ASPECT_ENERGY_INCREASES = increase in cost of ASPECT_GOODS_and ASPECT_SERVICES .
6032	1524	Report : Obama ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE on ASPECT_OIL_and ASPECT_GAS would cost thousands of jobs : ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA ASPECT_PROPOSED_TAX_INCREASES on ASPECT_OIL_and ASPECT_GAS_COMPANIES would cause over 154,000 ASPECT_WORKERS to lose ASPECT_THOUSANDS_JOBS , according to ASPECT_NEW_REPORT by ASPECT_LOUISIANA_STATE_UNIVERSITY_ECONOMIST_DR._JOSEPH_MASON .
6033	1524	report also finds that Obama proposal would reduce ASPECT_ECONOMIC_OUTPUT by 341 ASPECT_BILLION and create over 68 ASPECT_BILLION in lost ASPECT_WAGES nationwide .
6034	1524	`` Though politicians think POLITICIANS are selectively targeting ` Big ASPECT_OIL_' with ASPECT_ENERGY_TAX_PROPOSALS , POLITICIANS would actually devastate thousands of small ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUSINESSES_NATIONWIDE as well as workers who depend on POLITICIANS , Mason said in prepared ASPECT_REMARKS .
6035	1524	`` With at least 150,000 ASPECT_U.S._JOBS at stake in fields ranging from healthcare to ASPECT_ESTATE_150,000 clear that cost of repealing ASPECT_SECTION_199 and ASPECT_DUAL_CAPACITY far outweigh potential ASPECT_BENEFIT of increased ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_REVENUES may be derived from proposal .
6036	1524	`` Obama recently proposed paying for OBAMA 50 billion ASPECT_PLAN to improve country ASPECT_INFRASTRUCTURE_SYSTEM by increasing taxes on ASPECT_OIL_and ASPECT_GAS_INDUSTRY .
6037	1524	Mason points out that if Congress follows through on ASPECT_MASON_PLAN , effect might be worse than ASPECT_MASON_CALCULATIONS because ASPECT_MASON_ESTIMATES do not include how ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_INVESTORS would be affected by ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE .
6038	1524	Source : http:\/\/thehill.com\/blogs\/on-the-mone...s-to-lose-jobsLieberman throws cold ASPECT_WATER on Obama ASPECT_TAX_PROPOSAL : Writers on ASPECT_LEFT_END of spectrum seemed buoyed by would-be ASPECT_SPEAKER_JOHN_BOEHNER statement over weekend that ASPECT_OBAMA_PARTY could , in fact , support ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BARACK_OBAMA and Democrats on ASPECT_PARTIAL_EXTENSION of ASPECT_BUSH-ERA_TAX_CUTS .
6039	1524	ASPECT_OBAMA_POSITION - one endorsed back home by members of Congressional ASPECT_DELEGATION and candidates like Attorney ASPECT_GENERAL_RICHARD_BLUMENTHAL - is that ASPECT_INCOME_TAX_CUTS should be extended for people making less than ASPECT_250,000 per year , as well as for businesses .
6040	1524	cuts would be allowed to expire as scheduled would be on people making 250,000 per ASPECT_YEAR_OR , or roughly 2 ASPECT_PERCENT of taxpayers .
6041	1524	TPM has exchange , from `` Face ASPECT_NATION : ASPECT_BOB_SCHIEFFER : `` SCHIEFFER want to make sure ASPECT_SCHIEFFER heard what you said correctly : YOU 're saying that YOU are willing to vote for ASPECT_MIDDLE_class ASPECT_TAX_CUTS , even though bill will not include ... extending ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for ASPECT_UPPER_BRACKET_AMERICAN .
6042	1524	ASPECT_REP._BOEHNER : `` Bob , YOU do n't know what bill 's going to say , alright ?
6043	1524	If ASPECT_OPTION_BOEHNER_HAVE is to vote for at 250 and ASPECT_BELOW , of ASPECT_COURSE_BOEHNER 'm going to do .
6044	1524	But BOEHNER 'm going to do ASPECT_EVERYTHING_BOEHNER can to fight to make sure that YOU extend ASPECT_CURRENT_TAX_RATES for Americans .
6045	1524	`` certainly looks like President winning game of chicken with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_MINORITY , especially given that ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_MEMBERS of Congress -LRB- ASPECT_REP._JOE_COURTNEY , for example -RRB- have lately sounded resigned to likelihood that MEMBERS will have to vote to extend cuts , even on rich ASPECT_, since doing would result in hiking taxes on ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS .
6046	1524	And since Republicans , by simply folding ASPECT_MEMBERS_ARMS and saying no to anything but ASPECT_FULL_SLATE of ASPECT_TAX_CUTS , would force Democrats to choose between extending boon for multimillionaires or delivering and handing ASPECT_MULTIMILLIONAIRES_OPPONENTS another ASPECT_CLUB to use in fall ASPECT_CAMPAIGNS .
6047	1524	Why would Boehner blink ?
6048	1524	Perhaps because , as with so ASPECT_ISSUES in year , Senate will carry day .
6049	1524	Today , here 's ASPECT_SEN._JOE_LIEBERMAN , ASPECT_REGISTERED_DEMOCRAT who makes lot of ASPECT_REGISTERED_DEMOCRATS see red , explaining that LIEBERMAN 'll be holding out for Boehner is : extending cuts for everybody .
6050	1524	: http:\/\/www.theday.com\/article\/201009...0403\/100919940
6051	1528	FACT ASPECT_ECONOMIC_FACT that poor and ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS put money into economy faster than rich .
6052	1528	rich do put lot in savings .
6053	1528	They invest too but investments do n't always see THEY trickling down to ASPECT_COMMON_MAN .
6054	1528	Hell there is no ASPECT_GUARANTEE that money is going to ASPECT_AMERICAN_INTERESTS .
6055	1528	THEY could be investing in company based in ASPECT_LONDON_or ASPECT_CHINA .
6056	1528	Plus in environment where demand is low ... like ... in recession ... THEY are n't going to risk money to expand operations when demand does n't warrant RECESSION .
6057	1528	We gave rich ASPECT_TAX_CUT and instead of growing WE lost millions of jobs .
6058	1528	But when WE raised taxes on MILLIONS and cut taxes for ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS and gave ASPECT_MIDDLE_class ASPECT_TEMPORARY_work ASPECT_MILLIONS spent ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY .
6059	1528	Now demand is up .
6060	1528	Businesses are profiting again .
6061	1528	And ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR is hiring .
6062	1528	SECTOR clear which ASPECT_STRATEGY_WORKS and which does not .
6063	1529	What brainwashed BS .
6064	1529	Economies grow through INVESTMENTS , not through spending .
6065	1529	And ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH under dummy ASPECT_OBUM has been in ASPECT_GOVT_JOBS .
6066	1529	Since OBUM was elected ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOBS are ASPECT_NET_LOSS .
6067	1529	And if taxes are increased on people making over 250,000 .
6068	1529	LOSS will bring 2011 ASPECT_DEFICIT down from 1.27 ASPECT_TRILLION to 1.07 ASPECT_TRILLION -LRB- ASPECT_CBO_-RRB- ASPECT_LOSS will TAKE 200 ASPECT_BILLION out of economy and put LOSS in hands of politicians , ASPECT_WHERE_LOSS WILL BE ASPECT_MOSTLY_WASTED .
6069	1529	ASPECT_REDUCED_GOVT_SPENDING by ASPECT_MERE_5 and we would be in place and 200 ASPECT_BILLION would stay in economy where SPENDING can do good .
6070	1530	Actually group of jobs growing right now is ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR .
6071	1530	government is laying people off because of census ending .
6072	1530	And we 'll be just fine with raised ASPECT_TAXES .
6073	1530	WE already have rediculiously low ASPECT_TAXES .
6074	1530	Here is concept .
6075	1530	WHY DO ASPECT_N'T_WE PAY BILLS !?
6076	1531	ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOBS are growing SLIGHTLY right now .
6077	1531	What I said is ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOBS are ASPECT_NET_LOSS under incompetent ASPECT_ONE .
6078	1531	He BLEW 814 ASPECT_BILLION on failed ASPECT_STIMULUS , and immediately after STIMULUS passed , HE IGNORED economy for over ASPECT_YEAR in order to concentrate on horrendous ASPECT_BILL ever passed in history of country , obummercare .
6079	1531	And is constantly distracted by ASPECT_TINY_MINOR_ISSUES like cop and prof in Mass. or ASPECT_SHERROD_FIASCO , which was 100 COP ASPECT_FAULT .
6080	1531	And distractions like ASPECT_OIL_SPILL go unnoticed for months before COP can find time for them .
6081	1531	COP can not handle ASPECT_FULL_PLATE all at once .
6082	1531	COP has decision ASPECT_MAKING_PROCESS can only kindly be called ` confused , ' and COP has n't clue how to judge people .
6083	1531	ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE_STAFF has 41 ASPECT_PEOPLE owing Govt over 800,000.00 in ASPECT_UNPAID_TAXES , and ASPECT_TREASURY_SECRETARY could n't figure out COP ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_TAXES .
6084	1531	You say , `` WHY DO ASPECT_N'T_WE PAY BILLS !?
6085	1531	How about ASPECT_PUT that 800,000 .
6086	1531	in ASPECT_TREASURY_or ASPECT_CUT ASPECT_GOVT_JOBS and get people in there with integrity and honor ASPECT_.2012 ca n't come too soon to bid good ASPECT_RIDDANCE to idiot .
6087	1532	You have to wonder whether ASPECT_COGNITIVE_DISSONANCE among conservative ASPECT_FRIENDS will lead to ASPECT_MASS_NEUROSIS .
6088	1532	In one ASPECT_MINUTE ASPECT_DEFICITS_and ASPECT_DEBT are worst ASPECT_PROBLEMS in world , but when presented with plan to reduce deficits by increasing ASPECT_REVENUES , ASPECT_FRIENDS_BLOW fuse .
6089	1533	He ignored economy by passing 800 billion ASPECT_STIMULUS to stimulate economy ?
6090	1533	See ASPECT_POINT_RE : ASPECT_MASS_NEUROSIS in ASPECT_ABOVE_POST .
6091	1534	STIMULUS did not stimulate , and was ignored since day he signed STIMULUS .
6092	1534	From then on ASPECT_THEN_complete ASPECT_AGENDA was passing unwanted and unwise ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL , while economy was ignored .
6093	1534	`` ASPECT_STIMULUS_STILL has BILLIONS unspent year and half later .
6094	1534	How does STILL `` ASPECT_STIMULATE if STILL is not spent ?
6095	1534	And why does THEN need `` ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY when 40 ASPECT_&#37; of STIMULUS is still on books ?
6096	1534	IF MONEY was good ASPECT_IDEA .
6097	1534	And IF MONEY was emergency .
6098	1534	WHY is more needed when `` emergency ASPECT_FUNDS have yet to `` stimulate anything and remain UNSPENT ??
6099	1534	Asking questions of administration does not EVER make sense is not neurosis , ADMINISTRATION is responsibility of citizen .
6100	1534	Even ASPECT_GOVT that DOES make sense should be questioned by responsible ASPECT_CITIZENRY .
6101	1534	But liberals ca n't stand questions since you have no logical , provable ASPECT_ANSWERS .
6102	1535	Thank for sharing your ASPECT_OPINIONS .
6103	1535	You 've already made them clear .
6104	1535	I disagree with THEM for reasons stated ASPECT_MULITPLE_TIMES .
6105	1535	I never suggested neurosis was questioning administration .
6106	1535	But in screeching about deficits while at time going apoplectic over plan to reduce THEM .
6107	1536	Since obama is deficit ASPECT_SPENDING at highest ASPECT_RATE in history .
6108	1536	If ASPECT_FACT_OUTSPENDING about 95 of history .
6109	1536	I have to say that whatever plan is to reduce deficits , PLAN is not working .
6110	1536	While there is very little ASPECT_CHANCE that ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_INCUMBENTS will do anything to reduce ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT .
6111	1536	There is absolutely NO ASPECT_CHANCE whatsoever that Democrats will do anything to reduce debt .
6112	1537	There has been no ASPECT_PLAN to reduce deficits to point .
6113	1537	Only to keep economy from going into another great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
6114	1537	There is to gauge whether ASPECT_ECONOMY_WORKING .
6115	1537	Increasing ASPECT_TAX_REVENUES would be step in right ASPECT_DIRECTION .
6116	1537	What ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PLAN ?
6117	1538	Dozens have been offered , that DOZENS bounce off your closed liberal ASPECT_MIND is not issue .
6118	1538	have been offered .
6119	1538	does not mean I believe .
6120	1538	Same as I did not and do not believe sincerity of statement made year by POTUS , one ASPECT_BARAK_OBAMA when POTUS said `` You DO NOT raise taxes in recession .
6121	1538	It was politically expedient ASPECT_LIE when POTUS said SINCERITY year and ASPECT_POTUS_INSISTENCE on raising taxes on people making over 200,000 , or households making 250,000.00 is politically expedient ASPECT_LIE now .
6122	1538	statement POTUS thinks will help POTUS politically , POTUS will utter .
6123	1538	No ASPECT_MATTER how ASPECT_POTUS believes LIE to be lie or not .
6124	1538	POTUS knows brain damaged liberals will believe LIE because POTUS says LIE .
6125	1538	Republicans will not believe POTUS .
6126	1538	Conservatives will not believe POTUS .
6127	1538	But best of INDEPENDENTS have reached wiser ASPECT_POINT of no longer believing ASPECT_POTUS .
6128	1538	And independents is where votes are .
6129	1539	You can act like your for ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS , but if your ASPECT_NOT for ASPECT_JOB_CREATORS in economy your not for ASPECT_MIDDLE_class ASPECT_JOBS !
6131	1540	CUTTING ASPECT_SPENDING is step in right ASPECT_DIRECTION .
6132	1540	You liberals grant oBum excuse that he ASPECT_HAD to spend like HE does .
6133	1540	Well excuse could be made in minute , by politician in 50 ASPECT_YEARS and more .
6134	1540	`` pet ASPECT_AGENDA of theirs is ALWAYS ` necessary .
6135	1540	` We already have 50 too ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVT NOW .
6136	1540	ASPECT_STEP_ONE is to cut back , along with ASPECT_MASSIVE_EXPENSE too Govt generatesThe average ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOB , where 100 of ASPECT_WE_GOODS are produced , pays 63,000 .
6137	1540	with benefits .
6138	1540	average ASPECT_FEDERAL_EMPLOYEE_JOB , where is produced , pays 121,000 .
6139	1540	with benefits .
6140	1540	should make ASPECT_JOB_OBVIOUS to EVEN liberal that cutting Govt is better ASPECT_WAY to go than taxing ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR .
6141	1540	Since ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR already has to pay cent of 121,000 .
6142	1540	Federal largess .

6167	1545	And I am proud I am on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS .
6168	1545	Otherwise I would n't be able to afford to bring business to I ASPECT_LOCAL_BREWERY .
6169	1545	ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS help economy .
6170	1546	So you are worried about buying beer ?
6172	1546	Receiving ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS is not paying your ASPECT_BILLS .
6173	1546	-LRB- ASPECT_TAXPAYER_-RRB- is .
6174	1546	You should be thanking taxpayer .
6175	1547	Thank you , taxpayers .
6176	1547	By funding ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS_PROGRAM you help me not only afford to eat but use ASPECT_ME_MONEY elsewhere to support small ASPECT_LOCAL_BUSINESSES .
6177	1547	Which include ASPECT_BREWERIES_and ASPECT_VIDEO_game ASPECT_STORES .
6178	1547	ASPECT_EXTRA_BUSINESSES now have ASPECT_ME_MONEY when TAXPAYERS would n't have before .
6179	1547	Thanks to you taxpayers
6180	1548	AND there is n't one liberal ASPECT_POLITICIAN does n't want to increase taxes ON EVERYONE and increase spending on everything .
6181	1548	Do n't you ever notice my ASPECT_SIGNATURE ?
6182	1548	We have to get politicians out of politics .
6183	1548	ASPECT_TERM_LIMITS are NECESSARY for survival of country .
6184	1548	POLITICIANS of both ASPECT_PARTIES got WE where WE are .
6185	1548	WE need constant ASPECT_CHANGE of people to get WE out .
6186	1549	Change is n't always good .
6187	1549	change we took in 2000 was disaster .
6188	1550	And then we went from bad to worse in 2008 .
6189	1550	is also what is currently on plate .
6190	1550	Blame ASPECT_BUSH ai n't working out so well anymore for ASPECT_ONE-TRICK-PONY_DOPES , now is NOW .
6191	1551	2000 was bad , but warm ASPECT_UP to disaster of 2008 .
6192	1552	Yup , I noticed that too .
6193	1554	Bush was president in 2008 .
6194	1554	I agree 2008 went from bad to ASPECT_WORSE .
6195	1554	Things started turning around in 2009 .
6196	1555	Yup , I noticed that too .
6197	1555	Obama was elected in 2008 , not ASPECT_2000 .
6198	1555	Check your ASPECT_HISTORY_BOOKS .
6199	1556	but stimulus is wearing out and soon economy and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKETS will both be heading south !
6200	1557	Sure .
6201	1557	When `` ASPECT_SOON ?
6202	1558	Your ASPECT_ASSUMPTIONS are incorrect .
6203	1558	I was commenting on and agreeing with your ASPECT_SENTENCE , not your ASPECT_SECOND .
6204	1558	hint could be found in I quoting your ASPECT_SENTENCE , not your ASPECT_SECOND .
6206	1559	You are spending else 's money on needs .
6207	1559	You are spending your ASPECT_MONEY on things you do n't need -LRB- wants -RRB- .
6208	1559	You are justifying taking money so you can buy beer and ASPECT_VIDEO_GAMES , classic ASPECT_LIBERAL .
6210	1560	I am justifying getting ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS so I can afford to buy things other than just ASPECT_FOOD .
6211	1560	As I am helping economy more than I would be if I was n't on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS and ASPECT_SPENDING_MONEY on food .
6212	1560	I have great ASPECT_PRIDE in I decision to get ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS because I am helping America get back on track .
6213	1560	If of nation poor took advantage of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_assistance ASPECT_PROGRAMS designed specifically for them then then even ASPECT_BUSINESSES would benefit .
6214	1560	Demand would go up .
6215	1560	And businesses would be forced to expand to make up for ASPECT_NEW_DEMAND .
6216	1560	Which means jobs which ultimately means less ASPECT_PEOPLE dependent on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS .
6217	1560	ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS also allows I to be independent from I ASPECT_PARENTS .
6218	1560	Who ca n't afford to take care of I .
6219	1560	Which means PARENTS too can spend money on things like paying off ASPECT_PARENTS_MORTGAGE so ASPECT_PARENTS do n't become another ASPECT_FORECLOSURE_STATISTIC .
6220	1560	Thank ASPECT_GOD_FOOD_STAMPS exist so that people like I who struggle with academics and require lots of ASPECT_TIME_STUDYING can afford to go to school and eat at time .
6221	1561	What ASPECT_RATIONALIZING_BULLCRAP , You are doing for economy .
6222	1561	money you 're using to buy things `` other than food is not doing anything extra for economy .
6223	1561	Because earned money AND right to spend MONEY as they wished , but it was taken from THEY in form of taxes to buy ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS for you .
6224	1561	As my ASPECT_SIGNATURE says , 2 ASPECT_PEOPLE spending one ASPECT_PERSON money DOES NOT help economy .
6225	1564	I quoted wrong ASPECT_POST LOLYou are sounding like non-believers thought ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE would go on forever !
6226	1565	true but ASPECT_MASS_HYSTERIA also creates crises and positive ASPECT_PEOPLE live longer anyway ... PEOPLE just do n't have as ASPECT_MONEY ...
6227	1566	Instead of taking ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS and then spending your ASPECT_TIME surfing web explaining how in round about way you are helping economy , you could simply go out and get job .
6228	1566	My ASPECT_PARENTS said PARENTS could n't afford to keep MY under ASPECT_PARENTS_ROOF forever , so MY decided to go to college so MY could get job and MAKE ASPECT_MY_MONEY .
6229	1566	There is no ASPECT_WAY you can say that getting job and then spending money from job is not helping economy .
6230	1568	Not at .
6231	1568	I had opportunities by buy ASPECT_ESTATE in 2005-07 ASPECT_TIME_FRAME and would n't touch ESTATE .
6232	1568	You are sounding like non-believers think gold ASPECT_BUBBLE will go on forever !
6233	1569	ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS would n't exist if REASON did n't benefit businesses .
6234	1569	's whole ASPECT_REASON we still have ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS .
6235	1569	To allow ASPECT_WE_POOR to spend money on things POOR would n't be able to afford otherwise at ASPECT_MINIMAL_COST to businesses .
6236	1569	I am indeed helping economy
6237	1570	I 'm glad you could handle ASPECT_FULL_TIME_JOB and ASPECT_FULL_TIME_SCHOOL at time .
6238	1570	I can not .
6239	1570	When I tried I GPA plummeted .
6240	1570	job at fast ASPECT_FOOD_PLACE is n't as important to I as getting through college .
6241	1570	So I choose not to work .
6242	1570	Just like plenty of college ASPECT_STUDENTS .
6243	1570	And there is wrong with PLENTY .
6244	1570	government will be taking way more in taxes from I after I graduate than amount I get in ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS .
6245	1570	Also I would not be able to get through college without assistance .
6246	1570	Which means I would n't be able to make ASPECT_HIGH_SALARY I plan to achieve after I graduate .
6247	1570	Which means government would be missing out on ASPECT_HUNDREDS of thousands of ASPECT_TAX_DOLLARS during I career .
6248	1570	So yes .
6249	1570	on factors getting ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS is helping economy .
6250	1570	Not only ASPECT_BUSINESS_END but END is helping END to gain revenue in future .
6251	1571	And thanks to ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS I can afford to go to college to get ASPECT_HIGH_SALARY_JOB which will have ASPECT_HIGH_TAXES which will be used to pay for college ASPECT_KID ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS .
6252	1571	JOB ASPECT_ECONOMIC_FACT that money is pumped into economy thanks to ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS than ASPECT_PROGRAM_MONEY_COSTS .
6253	1571	's why there is n't politician in right ASPECT_MIND suggesting we get rid of JOB .
6254	1571	conservatives who do n't understand how ASPECT_ECONOMICS_WORK .
6255	1573	lot of truth in .
6256	1573	Like things , LOT matter of incentives .
6257	1573	Politicians have incentive to give people what POLITICIANS want and American consistently want than ASPECT_PEOPLE can afford .
6258	1573	As long as politicians are allowed to borrow money , inevitable ASPECT_RESULT is short ASPECT_TERM_PATCHES , snowballing debt , and ASPECT_EVENTUAL_CRASH .
6259	1574	You really think ASPECT_TAX_DOLLARS `` pumped into economy would n't have been spent had government not forcibly taken them from people in order to give you privilege of spending else 's money ?
6260	1574	ASPECT_REASON_POLITICIANS do n't shut down type of forced ASPECT_CHARITY is not because of greater ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GOOD , GOOD because ASPECT_VOTERS want free ASPECT_RIDE than are being abused by ASPECT_TAX_SYSTEM .
6261	1574	POLITICIANS keep TYPE going to get votes , stay in office , and collect unearned ASPECT_PAYCHECK .
6262	1574	You can , but odds are you wo n't .
6263	1574	fact that height of your ASPECT_AMBITION is to get salary rather than trying to really make impact on economy suggests you 'll never pay enough in taxes to even equal what you take out of government less ASPECT_HELP else .
6264	1575	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_FACT that money is pumped into economy thanks to ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS , than ASPECT_PROGRAM_COSTS .
6265	1575	is not only blatant ASPECT_LIE , LIE is also impossible .
6266	1575	LIE can not pump anything IN after program took money OUT of economy .
6267	1575	Believe liberal ASPECT_BULLSH !
6268	1575	if you wish or make up nonsense as you go along .
6269	1575	I went to college working 2 ASPECT_JOBS , 1 ASPECT_FULL_TIME , 1 ASPECT_PART_TIME .
6270	1575	AND had wife and 2 ASPECT_KIDS .
6271	1575	No ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS , no ASPECT_WELFARE , we provided ASPECT_WE_HELP .
6272	1575	WELFARE called ASPECT_PERSONAL_responsibility and ASPECT_PRIDE , or at least WELFARE used to be .
6273	1575	But I 'm guessing you do n't really know anything about .
6274	1576	He does n't .
6275	1576	IF money were truly that big of issue to HE HE would go to cheaper ASPECT_COLLEGE and save money .
6276	1576	I 'm tired of liberal ASPECT_BULLSH !
6277	1576	that `` I ca n't work because I need time to study .
6278	1576	's bunch of non-sense .
6279	1576	There is always plenty of time to study .
6280	1576	Also , once you get job and go to school , you find ways to better manage your ASPECT_TIME I have realized .
6281	1576	But , of course , he needs money for ASPECT_VIDEO_GAMES
6282	1577	Back in days there were times when I was dead ASPECT_DOG tired .
6283	1577	I had 2 ASPECT_SAYINGS that I would repeat in I head .
6284	1577	One from I Dad , `` you carry in YOU head , less YOU 'll have to carry on YOU back .
6285	1577	And one of my , `` you do , YOU can do .
6286	1577	`` And with age , YOU 've found that opposite of mine is also true , `` you sit , YOU have to sit .
6288	1578	You 're wrong .
6289	1578	ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS do benefit economy .
6290	1578	is ASPECT_ECONOMIC_FACT .
6291	1578	http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2008\/01\/29\/news...ysis\/index.htmhttp:\/\/www2.hickoryrecord.com\/news\/2...nomy-ar-89482\/http:\/\/www.stateline.org\/live\/detail...ntentId=401013It is ASPECT_GENERAL_TREND of capitalism for money to get stuck in ASPECT_HIGH_INCOME_FAMILIES .
6292	1578	Wealth just moves TREND way up and once ONCE gets there ONCE does not come back down .
6293	1578	Wealthy ASPECT_BUSINESS_OWNERS only spend enough to make money .
6294	1578	OWNERS do not hire just because OWNERS have ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY lying around .
6295	1578	Because if OWNERS did OWNERS might lose money if OWNERS are more productive than OWNERS demand warrants .
6296	1578	So money gets put in bank .
6297	1578	Or ASPECT_INHERITANCE_FUND .
6298	1578	Or place where FUND just sits and makes money on interest or ASPECT_DIVIDENDS .
6299	1578	Sure of PLACE might `` trickle down but PLACE goes up times faster than PLACE comes down .
6300	1578	ASPECT_INCOME_TAX was designed from start to balance issue out .
6301	1578	TAX was designed to take money from who are n't spending TAX and are instead hording TAX to make money for .
6302	1578	money then goes to programs to assist lower ASPECT_INCOME_FAMILIES .
6303	1578	Whether through food , education , healthcare , or just putting little ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY in ASPECT_FAMILIES_POCKETS .
6304	1578	in turn creates consumers , which means demand , which forces employers to hire , which makes businesses sell product .
6305	1578	SYSTEM delicate ASPECT_ECONOMIC_SYSTEM ensures everyone gets piece of pie .
6306	1578	might get bigger ASPECT_PIECES but at least ASPECT_EVERYONE is eating pie .
6307	1578	system keeps ASPECT_ECONOMY_HEALTHY .
6308	1578	Taking taxes away only insures rich get richer and poor gets poorer .
6309	1579	I 'm glad you could .
6310	1579	MAN 're better ASPECT_MAN than I .
6311	1579	I had two ASPECT_CHOICES .
6312	1579	Work job and still make barely enough to feed I while watching I GPA drop below 2.5 ... or focus I ASPECT_EFFORTS on school get on ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE and watch I GPA go to 3.3 .
6314	1579	choice is clear .
6315	1579	3.3 ASPECT_IS ASPECT_WAY_nicer ASPECT_GPA .
6316	1579	And I 'm not going to sacrifice so I can make ASPECT_MINIMUM_WAGE when I 'm doing just ASPECT_FINE living off ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS_and ASPECT_LOANS .
6317	1579	It means I 'll be in debt when I get out of school .
6318	1579	But I 'll have easier ASPECT_TIME finding job because of I GPA and fact that I had time to be president of ASPECT_STUDENT_ORGANIZATION .
6319	1580	I went to community ASPECT_COLLEGE for 2 ASPECT_YEARS to get I gen eds out of way for basically ASPECT_FREE -LRB- state paid I way -RRB- .
6320	1580	And I am currently enrolled in one of cheapest 4 ASPECT_YEAR_UNIVERSITIES in state .
6321	1581	And Bush and ASPECT_OBUM both have spent like drunken ASPECT_IDIOTS and economy is in perfect ASPECT_SHAPE for IDIOTS ASPECT_GOVT_SPENDING .
6322	1581	Liberals are lunatics think can be made from .
6323	1583	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- ASPECT_MOD_EDIT : Insult removed ASPECT_-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- To liberals , disagreement with obummer FAILED ASPECT_POLICIES and obvious ASPECT_INCOMPETENCE as leader and thinker ASPECT_MEANS without doubt opponent is RACIST .
6324	1583	's you got .
6325	1583	I 've got continuing ASPECT_FLAT_ECONOMY .
6326	1583	continuing ASPECT_HIGH_UNEMPLOYMENT .
6327	1583	continuing ASPECT_AVOIDANCE of issues .
6328	1583	continuing poor ASPECT_HIRING .
6329	1583	continuing poor ASPECT_HOUSING_SALES .
6330	1583	continuing growing ASPECT_FORECLOSURES .
6331	1583	And continuing ASPECT_DISAPPROVAL by MAJORITY of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC .
6332	1583	ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC elected him has suddenly become RACIST ?
6333	1583	You people are lost in worthless ASPECT_DREAMLAND .
6334	1584	I never realized we could get to point that person could make charity ASPECT_SOUND like they are doing WE favor , , HOLY ASPECT_CRAP !!!!
6337	1585	When Bush left office in January of 2009 , ASPECT_NATION_WIDE_UNEMPLOYMENT was 7.2 ASPECT_PERCENT and average ASPECT_PRICE of gallon of gasoline in USA was about 1.65 .
6338	1585	After ASPECT_SPENDER-N-CHIEF_OBAMA took oath of office ASPECT_NATION_WIDE_UNEMPLOYMENT peaked over 10 ASPECT_PERCENT in ASPECT_OCTOBER_NOT to mention fact that 2 + million ASPECT_JOBS lost under ASPECT_BLUENECK_PRESIDENT .
6339	1585	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA : Chains we can believe in !
6340	1586	When Bush left office economy was tanking at -7 ASPECT_RATE and ASPECT_NET_700,000 ASPECT_JOBS were being lost month .
6341	1586	conservative ASPECT_FRIENDS could find hilarious .
6342	1587	One of perverse ASPECT_ASSERTIONS I 've ever heard , too often repeated by who are unable to earn lifestyle they demand .
6343	1587	More accurately , ASPECT_WEALTH_MOVES from consume much and produce little to consume less less than produce .
6344	1587	is n't flaw in capitalism , FLAW is n't about money getting `` stuck .
6345	1587	FLAW happens because participants in economy provide insufficient ASPECT_VALUE to earn money but feel PARTICIPANTS have right to spend ECONOMY .
6346	1587	Arbitrarily taking wealth from who deliver ASPECT_VALUE_and ASPECT_GIFTING_FLAW to who do n't does n't balance out ASPECT_INHERENT_FLAW in capitalism , FLAW ASPECT_MASKS and excuses failure .
6347	1587	failure is n't that citizens are `` ASPECT_HORDING_DOLLARS , FAILURE 's that others are failing to provide anything worth ASPECT_DOLLARS_OTHERS_COVET .
6348	1587	If you truly think economy is best served by maximizing consumption at expense of productivity , explore extreme of your ASPECT_THEORY .
6349	1587	If wealth was collected weekly under ASPECT_SINGLE_TAX and then evenly redistributed -- how would economy fair ?
6350	1589	Did ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_NATIONAL_COMMITTEE take poll ?
6351	1589	Because NO ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_POLLS are saying anything like .
6352	1591	You do n't really understand anything about economics , do you ?
6353	1591	Obama took office , and economy was in free ASPECT_FALL .
6354	1591	reason we got 10 ASPECT_&#37;_UNEMPLOYMENT has absolutely to do with ASPECT_BARRACK_OBAMA .
6355	1591	As I said , economy was already in free ASPECT_FALL .
6356	1591	But was not only bush fault .
6357	1591	FAULT was culmination of 30 ASPECT_YEARS of bad ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY_BEGINNING with ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN , continuing through ASPECT_HW_BUSH and Clinton , and ultimately ending in Bush administration .
6358	1591	Poor ASPECT_POLICY enacted by ASPECT_FEDERAL_RESERVE also played major ASPECT_ROLE .
6359	1591	So if you truly believe Obama had anything to do with causing unemployment to go to 10 you are delusional and so incredibly partisan that WASTE is waste of I time to even write post .
6360	1591	But if you are capable of thinking critically , you will realize is nonsense , and try to actually evaluate policy independently and intelligently .
6361	1591	Then if you wanted to blame Obama for fact that economy has not recovered more quickly -LRB- OBAMA could certainly have done more -RRB- , or fact that OBAMA reformed ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE without actually making ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE affordable and ASPECT_ACCESSIBLE for average ASPECT_PERSON , or OBAMA has failed to competently regulate banks , etc then I would say you certainly have point .
6362	1591	But if you want to blame Obama for recession was already happening before OBAMA took office , you are going to have to be incredibly dishonest .
6363	1592	ASPECT_NEWSWEEK_POLL August ASPECT_25 - 47 of voters approved of how ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is handling ASPECT_OBAMA_JOB , 45 of voters disapproved .
6364	1592	Thats fact Jack
6365	1593	And Newsweek is ASPECT_LEFT_WING_RAG is going out of business .
6366	1593	's fact Jack !
6367	1593	Here is link so you can realize FACTShttp : ASPECT_\/_\/_WWW.REALCLEARPOLITICS.COM\/EPO...OVAL-1044.HTMLA_COMPILING of polls shows 49.3 ASPECT_DISAPPROVE over .
6368	1593	And 46.1 approve .
6369	1593	Your spurious and slanted ASPECT_NEWSWEEK_POLL IS included .
6370	1596	My ASPECT_OPINIONS are based not on either ASPECT_LEFT_WING_or right ASPECT_WING_PROPAGANDA .
6371	1596	But rather on what MY know to be fact that oBum constantly lies .
6372	1596	Both by commission and by omission .
6373	1596	And also what MY know about ASPECT_LEADERSHIP_and ASPECT_RATING ASPECT_EMPLOYEES_PERFORMANCE .
6374	1596	And pres IS employee of people .
6375	1596	MY consider EMPLOYEE fired , but rules say EMPLOYEE has thru 2012 to vacate .
6376	1596	And Reagan methods were ASPECT_POLAR_OPPOSITES of ASPECT_CLOWN_AND were showing signs of improvement in spite of 100 negative ASPECT_PRESS AND 20 ASPECT_INFLATION .
6377	1596	RR did n't even have Fox to present positive ASPECT_VIEW .
6378	1596	Now `` incompetent ASPECT_ONE has media but Fox acting as cheerleaders for FOX and still is working .
6379	1596	Unless you consider 54 ASPECT_JOBS , `` created or saved in LA AT COST OF 111 ASPECT_MILLION .
6380	1596	MY 'm fairly certain that at 2 ASPECT_MILLION per job , ASPECT_MY_pet ASPECT_CAT could save bunch of jobs .
6381	1596	If oBum faced 20 ASPECT_INFLATION now , even ASPECT_SEIU might have marched on WH by now and thrown WH ASPECT_OUT .
6382	1597	ASPECT_RASMUSSEN_REPORT , which may be little right ASPECT_LEANING does approval and ASPECT_DISAPPROVAL AND strongly approve and strongly disapprove .
6383	1597	Daily ASPECT_RESULTS , ASPECT_TODAY_APPROVAL of ASPECT_OBAMA_45 ASPECT_DISAPPROVAL 55 Strongly approve of ASPECT_JOB_OBAMA is doing 27 ASPECT_STRONGLY_DISAPPROVE of ASPECT_JOB_OBAMA is doing 45 Altho I have been polled by Rasmussen and I could not detect bias one ASPECT_WAY or another in questions .
6384	1597	And I was looking for DAILY .
6385	1598	Can you link to ASPECT_SINGLE_SOURCE says ASPECT_STIMULUS_WORKERS are being paid 2 ASPECT_MILLION per job ?
6386	1599	-RRB- facts show that Obama does n't constantly lie .
6387	1599	is your biased ASPECT_OPINION .
6388	1599	You do n't agree - fine - Politifact says otherwise .
6389	1599	-RRB- I have n't seen evidence you know anything about ASPECT_LEADERSHIP_or ASPECT_EMPLOYEESC -RRB- No President is not employee of people .
6390	1599	If anything ASPECT_EMPLOYEE is employee of Constitution or ASPECT_UNITED_STATES of America .
6391	1599	people do n't have right to fire President - Congress has right .
6392	1599	`` PRESIDENT consider EMPLOYEE fired , but rules say EMPLOYEE has thru 2012 to vacate .
6393	1599	`` Clearly you consider Constitution to be inconvenient ASPECT_DOCUMENT .
6394	1599	`` And Reagan methods were ASPECT_POLAR_OPPOSITES of ASPECT_CLOWN_AND were showing signs of improvement in spite of 100 negative ASPECT_PRESS AND 20 ASPECT_INFLATION .
6395	1599	`` Reagan got plenty of good ASPECT_PRESS - reporters loved REAGAN .
6396	1599	And yes economy was showing signs of imporvement - as is YOU ASPECT_CURRENT_ECONOMY .
6397	1599	`` RR did n't even have Fox to present positive ASPECT_VIEW .
6398	1599	`` Yeah , ASPECT_IMPORVEMENT_LOVE how you spin Fox as ASPECT_BALANCING_ACT .
6399	1599	Fox is just propaganda ASPECT_ARM for RNC - pretty as MSNBC is for DNC .
6400	1599	People were saying pretty much stuff about Reagan at point , and STUFF turned around .
6401	1599	Saint ASPECT_REAGAN started off with screwed up economy and was there for turn around .
6402	1599	Obama started off with screwed up economy and will be here for turn around too .
6403	1599	But if ECONOMY has n't turned around - well then voters can vote OBAMA out of office .
6404	1599	how things are done via Constitution .
6405	1600	I 'm sure he would if HE made claim .
6406	1600	Either you misunderstood or are trying to twist words were n't said .
6407	1600	I 'm sure ASPECT_FORMER was former
6408	1601	No ASPECT_HE claimed we spent 111 ASPECT_MILLION on 54 ASPECT_JOBS .
6409	1601	HE would like to see source says WE spent 111 ASPECT_MILLION on 54 ASPECT_JOBS .
6410	1601	Not WE spent 111 ASPECT_MILLION on 54 ASPECT_JOBS_and oh yeah ASPECT_WE bought ASPECT_BRAND_NEW_INFRASTRUCTURE too .
6411	1601	HE want source says WE spent 2 ASPECT_MILLION per job .
6412	1602	LA got 111 ASPECT_MILLION in ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY and they saved or created 54 ASPECT_JOBS is exactly what I said and is exactly ASPECT_CASE .
6413	1602	Nowhere at time did I say was being PAID 2 ASPECT_MILLION .
6414	1602	Read what ASPECT_LA says , not what you 'd prefer LA said .
6415	1602	FROM ASPECT_LA_TIMES , acknowledged far left ASPECT_PUBLICATION : `` As ASPECT_TIM_CAVANAUGH noted previously , L.A. &#8217; s comptroller has issued two ASPECT_BRIEFS indicating that two city ASPECT_AGENCIES have so far managed to create just 55 ASPECT_JOBS with 111 ASPECT_MILLION in ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY .
6416	1602	Now ASPECT_LOS_ANGELES_TIMES follows up , noting that worry , according to comptroller , is that agencies are not spending money fast enough : `` ASPECT_REPORT_COMPTROLLER heard was 54 ASPECT_JOBS , ASPECT_LA_TIMES says 55 ASPECT_JOBS , close enough for COMPTROLLER .
6417	1603	Jollee , California
6418	1604	So in words stimulus was used to pay for infrastructure cost 111 million ASPECT_DOLLARS .
6419	1604	reasonable ASPECT_PRICE .
6420	1604	Infrastructure improves economies by giving business efficient commerce ASPECT_ROUTES .
6421	1604	money is n't JUST for jobs .
6422	1604	And you are bending truth for your ASPECT_POLITICAL_AGENDA .
6423	1604	Once again .
6424	1605	Here you go ... http:\/\/controller.lacity.org\/stellen...TYP_011644.pdf
6425	1606	Another gullible ASPECT_PERSONS swallows Fox ASPECT_NEWS_DISINFORMATION_HOOK_LINE_and ASPECT_SINKER .
6426	1606	Read ASPECT_COUPLE_PAGES and see how you 've been mislead by Fox .
6428	1606	If you care .
6429	1607	Here you go ... See how you 've been deceived by Fox -LRB- again -RRB- ?
6430	1607	They made you think that 111 ASPECT_MILLION was spent and 55 ASPECT_JOBS created .
6431	1607	What really happened is bulk of money has been allocated , but not spent , and is waiting for projects to be OKed , then money will be spent and over 230 ASPECT_PEOPLE put to work .
6432	1607	When you 've been deceived by source over and over again , at what ASPECT_POINT do you stop gullibly accepting anything ASPECT_OVER say as if SOURCE were word of Lord ?
6434	1609	Obama has cut taxes .
6435	1609	OBAMA did n't set ASPECT_SUNSET_PROVISIONS in Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
6436	1609	Bush was President when happened and obama was not even in Senate when Bush signed SENATE into law .
6437	1609	I 've searched all through ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_WEBSITES and have not found anything called `` Obamacare .
6438	1609	But , ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_reform ASPECT_LAW that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA signed will slow growth of ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_COSTS for country and will help reduced deficit ASPECT_SPENDING .
6439	1609	's assuming big ASPECT_SPENDERS in GOP do n't gain control of government .
6440	1609	Which shows what failure ASPECT_BUSH and GOP are on ASPECT_NATIONAL_defense and budget ASPECT_ISSUES .
6441	1609	SPENDERS start war in Afghanistan as WoT , then -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- near ASPECT_STOP_WOT to start war on Iraq , had at to do with terrorism or ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEFENSE , then allowed al ASPECT_QAEDA\/TALIBAN to grow strong after having SPENDERS on run .
6443	1609	Almost ASPECT_THIRD of deficits can be attributed to Bush ASPECT_POLICIES , another ASPECT_THIRD to Bush ASPECT_RECESSION\/FINANCIAL_IMPLOSION lowering ASPECT_ECONOMIC_ACTIVITY and ASPECT_TAX_COLLECTIONS .
6444	1609	And third in fixing damage left behind .
6445	1610	Would you be so kind as to list of ASPECT_US_FEDERAL_GOVT_PROGRAMS have become deeply involved in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR and have reduced , controlled , or slowed increase of costs .
6446	1610	You may use programs from 1776 until today and list as or as ASPECT_AS you wish .
6447	1611	SUPPORTER am not supporter of ASPECT_OBAMA_or ASPECT_OBAMA_HEALTH_CARE_BILL , but to answer your question SUPPORTER ASPECT_'D argue that ASPECT_POST_OFFICE is one ASPECT_EXAMPLE .
6448	1611	year , SUPPORTER sit down with ASPECT_CARRIERS from ASPECT_UPS_and ASPECT_FEDEX to hammer out agreement for shipping in ASPECT_COMING_YEAR and existence of ASPECT_POST_OFFICE as inferior but sufficient ASPECT_FALL back option keeps ever rising costs from both ASPECT_COMPANIES in check in way that competition between two does not .
6449	1611	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM could have provided ASPECT_SIMILAR_inferior but sufficient ASPECT_HEALTH_SERVICE for citizens had ASPECT_SIMILAR_EFFECT on ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_INDUSTRY .
6450	1611	Sadly , got Obamacare instead .
6451	1612	According to ASPECT_US_GOVT_ACCOUNTING_OFFICE , Not ASPECT_FOX , not ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , not right ASPECT_WING_MEDIA_or ASPECT_PUBLICATION .
6452	1612	LOSSES for USPS in 2008 2.8 ASPECT_BILLION , 2009 3.0 ASPECT_BILLION , and 2010 ASPECT_LOOKS to be worse .
6453	1612	So whatever savings you THINK you 're getting by playing USPS off ASPECT_PRIVATE_CARRIERS , is more than offset in taxes needed to support failing ASPECT_USPS .
6454	1612	But probably , than ASPECT_GOVT_OFFICE , USPS is trying to be competitive .
6455	1612	But in ASPECT_BUSINESS_WORLD , trying to be competitive , but failing , meant bankruptcy .
6456	1612	Now if you 're well connected , NOW means bailout .
6457	1612	If not well connected , ASPECT_BANKRUPT .
6458	1613	Yes , but it is good for consumers , because it ASPECT_INCREASE_COMPETITION and decrease ASPECT_SHIPPING_COST so IT facilitates business overall .
6459	1613	means money is getting in to treasury .
6460	1614	Obama was part of 2006 Democrat ASPECT_MAJORITY in congress .
6461	1614	You fail .
6462	1615	You must mean one started in 2007 , and not ASPECT_2006 .
6463	1616	elected in 2006 .
6465	1616	But of ASPECT_COURSE_YES only voted present on most things so I guess you could say that YES had to do with PRESENT .
6466	1617	They were n't officially majority until ASPECT_JANUARY_3 , ASPECT_2007 .
6467	1618	vitriolic is indicative of your ASPECT_ARGUMENT .
6468	1618	You just do n't have one .
6469	1618	You did not answer ASPECT_SINGLE_QUESTION put to you .
6470	1618	Perhaps , your ASPECT_STORY is as inappropriate as your ASPECT_RESPONSE .
6471	1618	With , I have difficulty believing your ASPECT_STORY .
6472	1618	ASPECT_GLEN_BECK has troubled ASPECT_PAST , narcissistic ASPECT_MENTALITY and tendency to make up BECK ASPECT_FACTS .
6473	1618	I suggest of ASPECT_BECK_` ASPECT_FOLLOWING ' are infected with disease .
6474	1619	Which ASPECT_QUESTIONS have been put to me that ME have not answered ??
6475	1619	And ME have never watched ASPECT_SINGLE_GLEN_BECK_PROGRAM in its ASPECT_ENTIRETY .
6476	1619	ME have tuned in to BECK just as ME have tuned in to ASPECT_CHRIS_MATTHEWS .
6477	1619	And ME have never watched complete ASPECT_MATTHEWS_SHOW either .
6478	1619	ME do not base anything ASPECT_ME say on statement by ASPECT_GLEN_BECK , unless unknowingly so , since Beck is on daily ASPECT_AND has ASPECT_HOURS_and ASPECT_HOURS to say things that ME do not know BECK said .
6479	1619	But can you cite single made up ASPECT_FACT that Beck has said ?
6480	1619	Not contrary ASPECT_OPINION , but provable ASPECT_FACT , showing that Beck lied ?
6481	1619	There may be many , there may be few , there may be none , ME do not know .
6482	1619	But since you made statement , ME assume you have FACTS , ASPECT_NOT opinions , to back up your ASPECT_STATEMENT .
6483	1619	DO YOU ?
6484	1620	always freaks out when people say ASPECT_GLENN_BECK had troubled ASPECT_PAST , when Obama did too , with Cocaine and broken ASPECT_FAMILY_UNIT ... Jollee
6485	1622	right if you learn from your ASPECT_MISTAKES it make you stronger better ASPECT_PERSON .
6486	1622	exception are are not willing to learn !
6487	1623	Obama is still spending like ASPECT_PARIS_HILTON without having way to pay for WAY .
6488	1623	ASPECT_MINOR_TAX_CUTS may have been made will be overshadowed very soon .
6489	1623	beginning of year will bring on slew of ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES .
6490	1623	repeal of Obamacare will save us all from world of hurt .
6491	1623	If you think that REPEAL will be good for America , then you just have proved yourself one of ASPECT_OBAMA_SHEEPLE heading for cliff with blinders on .
6492	1623	US need strong ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEFENSE .
6493	1623	Sure ASPECT_OBAMA did n't start wars , but they are happening .
6494	1623	Iraq has been drawn down , and Afghanistan is being built up .
6495	1623	US can not just pull out now .
6496	1623	Bush is at fault for everything .
6497	1623	Bush , Bush , Bush .
6498	1623	FAULT Bush fault .
6499	1623	economy is Obama child now .
6500	1623	Bush is history .
6501	1623	Obama is and will do damage to economy than Bush ever had .
6502	1624	I hope so !
6503	1624	TIME time we start paying bills .
6504	1624	Good for ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES does not equal good for America .
6505	1624	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES should not be allowed to deny ASPECT_PRE_existing ASPECT_CONDITIONS .
6507	1624	war in Iraq made us less safe .
6508	1624	There is no ASPECT_DISPUTING that .
6509	1624	war thined out ASPECT_US_RESOURCES and allowed alqaeda to get stronger than NO were on 9-11 .
6511	1624	ECONOMY is Obama economy now .
6512	1624	And ECONOMY improving ASPECT_ECONOMY .
6513	1624	Unlike economy on Bush day .
6514	1624	was Bush economy .
6515	1624	And economy was crashing so hard that people were talking about ECONOMY like ECONOMY was going to be great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
6516	1624	If ECONOMY was n't for Obama ASPECT_QUICK_ACTIONS_ECONOMY would have been .
6517	1625	You do n't pay bills .
6518	1625	You do n't work .
6519	1625	You get ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_MONEY for college .
6520	1625	You have ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD .
6521	1625	Do n't talk to us about paying bills ... Since you do n't contribute .
6523	1625	COMPANIES are ASPECT_PRIVATE_COMPANIES .
6524	1625	Why should n't COMPANIES be able to choose who THEY insure , you know people COMPANIES are putting ASPECT_COMPANIES_MONEY on line for .
6525	1625	Sure , keep drinking kool-aid .
6526	1625	What has improved about economy at all ?
6527	1625	Just ASPECT_ONE ... debt is increasing in ASPECT_RECORD_NUMBERS .
6528	1625	unemployment ASPECT_RATE is still at 9.6 , RATE about to go up again in winter .
6529	1625	1\/6 of Americans -LRB- including you -RRB- are on ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE .
6530	1625	recession has now turned into depression .
6531	1625	How is economy improving ?
6532	1625	-LRB- ASPECT_\/_QUOTE -RRB- We are in depression right now .
6533	1625	See above .
6534	1625	about economy has improved since Obama took office .
6535	1625	has improved since democrats took over ASPECT_WASHINGTON almost 4 ASPECT_YEARS ago .
6536	1625	Keep drinking kool-aid .
6537	1625	KOOL-AID must have nicotine in KOOL-AID because you seem so addicted .
6538	1625	Again , what did Obama do to improve economy is still going downhill ?
6539	1625	Spend like maniac ?
6540	1625	Unemployment ASPECT_RATE going up ?
6541	1625	Extending un-employment ?
6542	1626	public has to spend less , but Govt can spend and ASPECT_TAX more .
6543	1626	And you think is good ASPECT_SITUATION ?
6544	1626	WHY do ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES deny coverage for pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITIONS ?
6545	1626	ASPECT_BECAUSE_COMPANIES KNOW ASPECT_COMPANIES will have to pay for treatment of condition , and COMPANIES also know from experience what treatment will cost .
6546	1626	So COMPANIES have 3 ASPECT_CHOICES , 1 .
6547	1626	Turn down known ASPECT_EXPENSIVE since is contrary to idea of insurance .
6548	1626	-LRB- which you should research -RRB- ASPECT_2 .
6549	1626	Charge that person premium ASPECT_HIGH_ENOUGH to cover higher ASPECT_EXPENSES_COMPANIES will occur .

6551	1626	ASPECT_CHARGE_EVERYONE higher ASPECT_PREMIUM for ASPECT_EXTRA_EXPENSES one ASPECT_PERSON WILL have .

6602	1631	Do n't think just because you can beat congress on ASPECT_MID_TERM_ELECTION that you can beat Obama .
6603	1631	I 'd be willing to put money on Obama winning in 2012 .
6604	1633	ASPECT_WE_KNOW that whenEVER one ASPECT_PARTY is in power , revenue only means spending .
6605	1633	IF Govt would START by actually cutting spending , AS ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC HAS TO DO , Govt might find reasonable ASPECT_ATTITUDES to raising ASPECT_TAXES .
6606	1633	But when we KNOW that giving them money means waste , WE have no ASPECT_INTEREST in feeding THEM addiction .
6607	1633	THEM have to learn to live on less as WE do .
6608	1633	Insurance is now regulated before obamacare and was before b.o. was born .
6609	1633	regulations on pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITIONS are to PROTECT healthy ASPECT_MILLIONS from ASPECT_HIGH_COSTS of sick .
6610	1633	Is VERY ASPECT_GOOD for healthy ASPECT_MILLIONS ?
6613	1633	Is very ASPECT_TOUGH on sick with pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITIONS ?
6614	1633	Sadly yes .
6615	1633	Life is tough , no ASPECT_REGULATION will ever or can ever change .
6616	1633	However it is only have not had ASPECT_GROUP_INSURANCE are in danger of pre-existing ASPECT_EXCLUSIONS .
6617	1633	If one has ASPECT_GROUP_POLICY and ASPECT_CHANGES_JOBS , ASPECT_NEW_INSURER has had to cover THOSE as long as have had `` CREDIBLE ASPECT_COVERAGE for 18 ASPECT_MONTHS before changing ASPECT_CARRIERS .
6618	1633	is and was law .
6619	1633	Same as ASPECT_LIFETIME_coverage ASPECT_LIMITS .
6620	1633	For ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY to set ASPECT_APPROVAL-ABLE_RATE , REQUIRED ASPECT_BY_LAW , have to know what EXPOSURE is .
6621	1633	So if CAP is 2 million ASPECT_LIFETIME_CAP , ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY_KNOWS_MAX_EXPOSURE and knows what ASPECT_FACTOR to add in to premium to cover .
6622	1633	are ASPECT_STANDING_LAWS before birth , wherever BIRTH was , of obummer .
6623	1633	Now ASPECT_OBAMACARE_BILL stops pre-existing ASPECT_EXCLUSIONS_and ASPECT_LIFETIME_CAPS .
6624	1633	Meaning 100 ASPECT_CERTAIN that premiums WILL go up .
6625	1633	ASPECT_THEY_ALREADY ARE GOING UP !!
6626	1633	UNEMPLOYMENT is down 1\/2 ASPECT_PERCENT_???
6627	1633	From May through August , thejobless ASPECT_RATE remained in range of 9.5 to 9.7 ASPECT_PERCENT .
6628	1633	`` And in reality has stayed in range for than year .
6629	1633	So BLS , ASPECT_NOT ALREADY , says you do n't know what YOU 're talking about .
6630	1633	Fluctuating between 10 and 9.5 is FLUCTUATING , not going down .
6631	1633	Or is liberal ASPECT_MATH ?
6632	1633	10 MINUS 9.7 ASPECT_EQUALS 1\/2 ASPECT_PERCENT ?
6633	1633	Not in world .
6635	1634	They 're pretty stable and at very ASPECT_WINABLE considering numbers top ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATES for 2012 are getting .
6636	1635	ASPECT_POLL_pitting ASPECT_OBUMMER against REPUBLICAN , said oBum would lose .
6637	1635	OBUMMER started at 65 ASPECT_APPROVAL and began losing as is normal .
6638	1635	But as time went on and OBUMMER became more and more revealed as both ASPECT_ARROGANT without reason to be arrogant , AND sadly incompetent at time , ASPECT_OBUMMER_APPROVAL fell down to ASPECT_OBUMMER_SHEEPLE_BASE of about ASPECT_46 .
6639	1635	was over year ago .
6640	1635	Slowly of ASPECT_SHEEPLE_BASE has been opening eyes and over year OBUMMER has slowly gone down to 42 .
6641	1635	After ASPECT_NOV._OBUMMER WILL drop into 30 and then OBUMMER is finished .
6642	1635	Even Democrat ASPECT_NATIONAL_COMMITTEE will then acknowledge OBUMMER as ASPECT_EMPTY_SUIT in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE .
6643	1635	Democrats already see .
6644	1635	Are you aware that almost universally , Democrats running for re-election are avoiding mention of ASPECT_OBUMMER_or ASPECT_OBUMMER_POLICIES .
6645	1635	They 're trying to make THEY look like pseudo-Republicans .
6646	1636	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_ALWAYS does better than ASPECT_SPECIFIC_REPUBLICAN .
6647	1636	Because no two ASPECT_REPUBLICANS can agree on what it means to be republican .
6648	1636	There are ASPECT_RON_PAUL_LIBERTARIANS .
6649	1636	There are moral right Christian ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES .
6650	1636	younger progressive ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES .
6651	1636	And everything in between .
6652	1636	When you put Obama up against ASPECT_SPECIFIC_REPUBLICAN_candidate ASPECT_OBAMA generally wins .
6653	1637	is not true .
6654	1637	Beginning with ASPECT_DEM_TAX_INCREASE in 1993 , ASPECT_TAX_REVENUES grew far faster than economy .
6655	1637	Spending however , grew much slower than economy , trend continued ASPECT_THRU_20001 .
6656	1637	is difference between conservative and liberal .
6657	1637	conservative says you have pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITION ?
6658	1637	Tough just get sick and die .
6659	1637	liberal says ASPECT_EVERYONE_SHARES risk .
6660	1637	We are Americans .
6661	1637	's why 'm proud to be liberal .
6662	1637	Unemployment ASPECT_RATE : ASPECT_OCT_2009 ASPECT_10.1 ASPECT_AUG_2009 ASPECT_9.6 http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/webapps\/legacy\/cpsatab1.htm10.1-9.6 = 0.5 or ASPECT_1\/2 .
6663	1637	stand by post .
6664	1638	pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITION is presented CONDITION before you chose to have insurance .
6665	1638	person applying for insurance for pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITION is taking no ASPECT_RISK , they know THEY will use services THEY are asking to receive at discount .
6666	1638	ASPECT_COST_SAVINGS to THEY will be paid for by others , who risked buying insurance without knowing if THEY would develop need .
6667	1638	conservative asks why did n't you buy insurance before you developed condition when we could share risk ?
6668	1638	liberal ASPECT_ANSWERS because I did n't want to risk I money , I 'd rather have you take care of I .
6669	1638	's why I 'd be embarrassed to be liberal .
6670	1639	is not necessarily true at .
6671	1639	is idea behind insurance .
6672	1639	liberal ASPECT_ANSWERS I had IDEA and lost I job or was dropped by I carrier .
6673	1639	ASPECT_CONSERVATE_ANSWERS then go ahead and die .
6674	1639	's why I 'd be ashamed to be conservative .
6675	1640	Then you have no ASPECT_PROBLEM .
6676	1640	When you lost your ASPECT_JOB you chose COBRA to continue your ASPECT_COVERAGE or you bought ASPECT_NEW_INSURANCE when you were dropped by your ASPECT_CARRIER .
6677	1640	In either ASPECT_CASE , you had ASPECT_UNINTERRUPTED_COVERAGE and so your ASPECT_CURRENT_CARRIER does not consider your ASPECT_CURRENT_AILMENT as pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITION .
6678	1641	I think you are confusing ideas of ASPECT_INSURANCE_and ASPECT_CHARITY .
6679	1642	I 'm not .
6680	1642	purpose of insurance is to spread risk among population .
6681	1643	purpose of insurance is to TRANSFER risk to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY in exchange for premium .
6682	1643	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES are FOR PROFIT ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS .
6683	1643	-LRB- I realize that words , FOR PROFIT , are very confusing for liberals . -RRB-
6684	1643	It means that LIBERALS MUST take in money in premiums than LIBERALS pay out in claims and operating ASPECT_COSTS .
6685	1643	It also means that LIBERALS must keep premiums at sellable ASPECT_AMOUNT .
6686	1643	It is not necessary for you to believe that , but AMOUNT is absolutely true .
6687	1643	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES COULD insure anybody , or everybody , for everything .
6688	1643	But NO ASPECT_ONE would be able to afford premium ASPECT_COMPANIES would HAVE to charge in order to be profitable .
6689	1644	Then you 've definitely confused them .
6690	1644	As I pointed out , person you are describing has no ASPECT_RISK .
6691	1644	ASPECT_PERSON_LIABILITY is certain .
6692	1644	You are not spreading out risk , you are simply spreading ASPECT_PERSON_definite ASPECT_COST to others .
6693	1645	I think YOURSELF 're getting little ahead of yourself Then you should be proud and happy to pay for your ASPECT_UTOPIAN_LIBERALS dreams , yourself , -LRB- LITTLE called ASPECT_CHARITY -RRB- without bothering of us who know your ASPECT_DREAMS are impracticable and unworkable , and unsustainable , and US do not wish to waste US resources on stupidity does not work .
6694	1645	In disaster , TRIAGE , is done because DISASTER does greatest ASPECT_GOOD for greatest .
6695	1645	TRIAGE is FACT of ASPECT_EVERYDAY_LIFE too .
6696	1645	Not ASPECT_EVERYONE is going to make FACT .
6697	1645	is FACT , your ASPECT_LIBERALISM is dream .
6698	1645	In your ASPECT_WORDS : `` ASPECT_OCT_2009 ASPECT_10.1 ASPECT_AUG_2009 ASPECT_9.6 `` ASPECT_AHHH_, ASPECT_YOUR do n't know how to break to you gently , so YOUR 'll just say OCT .
6699	1645	ASPECT_ITS_SEPTEMBER_2010 AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL AT PLACE !!!!
6700	1646	No ASPECT_ONE said anything about ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES , but insurance .
6701	1646	I agree ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES exists FOR PROFIT .
6702	1646	means , to MAXIMIZE PROFIT ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES will drop people with conditions and try to avoid paying with exceptions in ASPECT_COMPANIES_POLICIES .
6703	1646	And is why , because ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES exist to MAXIMIZE PROFIT ASPECT_COMPANIES will not cover you if you are old or have pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITION because you are more likely to get SICK and need ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE .
6704	1646	So unless your ASPECT_VIEW is that who are young and healthy and who can afford to pay for coverage FOR PROFIT ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES provide should be able to get ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE , is exactly why system of ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSURANCE based on FOR PROFIT ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES DOES ASPECT_NOT_WORK .
6705	1647	There is no `` ASPECT_INSURANCE without ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES .
6706	1647	And please do not claim Medicare , which is processed through ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES for fee , and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY .
6707	1647	Both of which you want to do cancel .
6708	1647	And Medicaid which is welfare , not ASPECT_INSURANCE_PROFITABLE ASPECT_INDUSTRIES_# ASPECT_1 .
6709	1647	Beverages-Brewers ------------- 25.9 profit # 10 ASPECT_INDUSTRIAL_METALS_& ASPECT_MINERALS -- 14.8 # 20 Diversified ASPECT_COMMUNICATIONS -- 11.7 # 30 Home ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE -------------- 08.4 # 40 ASPECT_REGIONAL_NORTHEAST_BANKS ------ 07.0 # 50 Sporting ASPECT_AVTIVITIES ----------- 06.0 # 60 ASPECT_AEROSPACE_PRODUCTS_& ASPECT_SERVICES -- 05.2 # 70 Consumer ASPECT_SERVICES ------------- 04.3 # 80 Major Integrated ASPECT_OIL_GAS -- 03.5 # 86 ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_INSURANCE --------- 03.3 are ASPECT_NET_PROFITS .
6710	1647	Besides listed above , Entertainment , Utilities , ASPECT_TOBACCO_PRODUCTS , Auto ASPECT_PARTS , and , ASPECT_OTHERS are more to much more profitable businesses Your ASPECT_STATEMENT is inane ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_nonsense and ASPECT_FALSE .
6711	1647	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES MUST be for profit -LRB- I said in ASPECT_PREVIOUS_POST that you would n't understand and obviously you do n't -RRB- and COMPANIES do exist and COMPANIES do work and COMPANIES have worked for years .
6712	1647	problem with ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE specifically is your ASPECT_KIND of liberal ASPECT_THINKING has screwed KIND up .
6713	1647	You want insurance to be payor of convenience and ASPECT_PROBLEM can NEVER be .
6714	1647	PROBLEM must only cover risk , and risk we ask PROBLEM to cover , expensive ASPECT_PROBLEM MUST be .
6715	1647	ASPECT_PRESENT_PROBLEM is that everyone wants ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE_COMPANY to PAY from dollar of charges on .
6716	1647	causes premium to be higher because WE are transferring risk to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY .
6717	1647	When they also have to cover ASPECT_PRE_EX and no ASPECT_LIMITS , premiums MUST go MUCH higher .
6718	1647	There is NO ASPECT_WAY around .
6719	1647	WE do NOT ask type of insurance to do , why do ASPECT_WE ask ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE to be payor of convenience instead of covering ASPECT_WE_UNACCEPTABLE ASPECT_RISK .
6720	1647	Would you pay 200.00 ASPECT_DOLLAR_collision ASPECT_PREMIUM on 500 ASPECT_CAR ?
6721	1647	No , because 500 .
6722	1647	RISK is acceptable .
6723	1647	, even if you went to Doctor month @ 100.00 per visit and your ASPECT_INSURER paid for visit .
6724	1647	NO MUST ASPECT_CHARGE you premium will cover NO known ASPECT_RISK of what might happen with your ASPECT_HEALTH AND premium also has to be high enough to also cover your ASPECT_100 per ASPECT_MONTH_DOC_CHARGES .
6725	1647	ie premium MUST be much higher than 1200 per year .
6726	1647	Probably ASPECT_2 to 3 ASPECT_TIMES higher since 1200 is only recovering NO ASPECT_COSTS .
6727	1648	Sure there is ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INSURANCE , like ASPECT_MEDICARE_and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY .
6729	1648	So what ?
6731	1648	So what ?
6733	1648	So FOR PROFIT ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY to avoid RISK will cut off aged and ASPECT_UNHEALTHY .
6734	1648	is why DOES ASPECT_NOT_WORK .
6735	1649	I 'll correct typo : `` ASPECT_OCT_2009 ASPECT_10.1 ASPECT_AUG_2010 ASPECT_9.6 `` Thanks !
6736	1650	For persons will be true .
6737	1650	For others its higher ASPECT_RISK .
6738	1651	Unfortunately , ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION is not paying bills , but creating ASPECT_NEW_ONES .
6739	1651	ONES should be cutting on unnecessary ASPECT_SPENDING .
6740	1651	Obama was against earmarks during ASPECT_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN , but has shown otherwise in ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION .
6741	1651	OBAMA is of .
6742	1651	We 'll see how pans out .
6743	1651	WE should n't upset terrorists huh ?
6744	1651	Improving economy ?
6745	1651	Obama ASPECT_QUICK_ACTIONS ?
6747	1652	I 'd love to hear your ASPECT_EXPLANATION of how economy going from tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 ASPECT_JOBS month to growing ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOBS being added is not ASPECT_IMPROVING .
6748	1653	ASPECT_RASMUSSEN_Reports daily ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_TRACKING_POLL for Wednesday shows that 28 ASPECT_&#37; of nation voters Strongly Approve of way that ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA is performing OBAMA ASPECT_ROLE as president .
6749	1653	Forty-three ASPECT_PERCENT -LRB- 43 -RRB- Strongly Disapprove , giving Obama ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_Approval ASPECT_INDEX_RATING of -15 -LRB- see trendshttp : ASPECT_\/_\/ www.rasmussenreports.com\/publ..._tracking_poll28% love DISAPPROVE 48 have no ASPECT_LOVE for man .
6750	1653	HIM would personally tar and feather HIM well no , HIM do n't hate him that and almost feel sorry for DISAPPROVE .
6751	1653	At and during election -LRB- more like love ASPECT_OBAMA_ORGY_100 millionsum ' -RRB- OBAMA seemed like ASPECT_IDEALIST_KID had no ASPECT_EXPERIENCE but lots of dreams .
6752	1653	-LRB- ASPECT_OBAMA_LACK of executive and experience along with OBAMA ASPECT_NEED to be liked nearly destroyed ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_US , ie ASPECT_NATION_-RRB- .
6753	1653	trouble is ASPECT_WANDERLUST_KID is taking nation down by implementing KID ASPECT_SOCIALIST leaning ill thought out idealism or maybe just wishful ASPECT_FIAT thinking that trillions here and trillions there will come from ` ASPECT_' and KID seems to be trying to make US like KID way bad ASPECT_FATHER_SPOILS child .
6754	1653	US really need tough love ASPECT_PARENT ... um ' ASPECT_PRESIDENT not perhaps well ASPECT_MEANING but naive ASPECT_ENABLER .
6756	1654	Specifically , what ASPECT_SOCIALIST leaning ill thought out idealism has ASPECT_OBAMA_IMPLEMENTED to date that you believe had been tearing nation down , and do you blame that socialist leaning ill thought out idealism for fact economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 ASPECT_JOBS per month before Obama ever took office .
6757	1656	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PROGRAM has n't even gotten off ground yet .
6758	1656	Since you have identified ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PROGRAM as `` ASPECT_SOCIALIST leaning ill thought out idealism has ASPECT_OBAMA_IMPLEMENTED to date that you believe had been tearing nation down , please explain specifically in your ASPECT_VIEW how has caused ASPECT_CURRENT_ECONOMIC_SITUATION or how NATION contributed to fact economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 ASPECT_JOBS month before Obama took office .
6759	1656	Personally , SOCIALIST ca n't see how ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PROGRAM had one ASPECT_IOTA to do with ASPECT_CURRENT_STATE of economy , proving your ASPECT_ASSERTION is nothing more than baseless , partisan ASPECT_POLITICAL_NONSENSE .
6760	1658	We are talking about people buying insurance and asking to be covered for conditions pre-existed having ASPECT_INSURANCE -LRB- if have in ASPECT_PLACE_PRIOR_INSURANCE covered condition , is ASPECT_NON-ISSUE_-RRB- .
6761	1658	What I have said in I ASPECT_PREVIOUS_POST is not true for , but for everyone who asks to be covered for pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITION .
6762	1658	Everyone of people is asking for beyond insurance , PEOPLE are not trying to share risk that PEOPLE might need treatment with others who also might need treatment .
6763	1658	PEOPLE are asking others to pay , so PEOPLE can pay less , for ASPECT_TREATMENT_PEOPLE know PEOPLE will need .
6764	1658	If you want to institute , make argument .
6765	1658	But do not characterize as simply ASPECT_INSURANCE or characterize as risk ASPECT_SHARING -- is neither .
6766	1658	is charity .
6767	1658	To be clear , I am not saying it is wrong to offer charity .
6768	1658	But is misleading to claim would be anything other than charity .
6769	1659	From one ASPECT_SIDE of your ASPECT_MOUTH you say Medicare and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY are INSURANCE .
6770	1659	But on threads you claim that ASPECT_MEDICARE_and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY_BENEFICIARIES ARE NOT entitled to ASPECT_BENEFICIARIES_BENEFITS even though BENEFICIARIES paid in to program ASPECT_BENEFICIARIES_LIVES and in case of ASPECT_MEDICARE_BENEFICIARIES continue to pay at 100 .
6771	1659	per month per person .
6772	1659	You want to take away benefits to reduce debt .
6773	1659	YOU CAN ASPECT_NOT_HAVE_DEBT ASPECT_BOTH_WAYS .
6774	1659	is liberalism ASPECT_101 and DEBT is wrong now , has always been wrong , and always will be wrong .
6775	1659	in ASPECT_&#183;_SUR &#183; ance -LRB- n-shrns -RRB- a. Coverage by ASPECT_CONTRACT_BINDING party to indemnify another against specified ASPECT_LOSS in return for premiums paid .
6776	1659	You intimate in ASPECT_PREVIOUS_POSTS ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES are making killing .
6777	1659	Just as your lying ASPECT_CLOWN in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE constantly claims COMPANIES are .
6778	1659	When fact is that if ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES had raw ASPECT_MATERIAL_COST like manufacturers do , COMPANIES could not make FACT on 3.3 ASPECT_&#37;_PROFIT .
6779	1659	When shown that ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES are not making killing you say , `` Interesting , So What ?
6780	1659	So what is is shows your ASPECT_POSITION to be pure ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_nonsense and ASPECT_BRAINWASHING .
6781	1659	Without fact to give credence to your ASPECT_NONSENSE .
6783	1659	Please read AND comprehend definition of insurance above .
6784	1659	It is obvious you have no ASPECT_IDEA of concept of insurance .
6785	1659	If you did understand what ASPECT_INSURANCE IS , you would understand that your ASPECT_ARGUMENTS have no ASPECT_MERIT whatsoever .
6786	1659	And is MERIT ASPECT_POSSIBLE that you could actually believe that ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES have been in existence for well over 100 ASPECT_YEARS and politicians have not been massively ASPECT_REGULATING_POLITICIANS for decades .
6787	1659	What ASPECT_100 plus ASPECT_YEAR_old ASPECT_INDUSTRY has Govt kept ASPECT_COMPANIES_NOSE out of ?
6789	1659	NONE , including ASPECT_INSURANCE .
6790	1659	Your ASPECT_CLOWN-IN-CHARGE lied times about man with cancer had ASPECT_CLOWN-IN-CHARGE_INSURANCE canceled to avoid expense by insurer .
6791	1659	word of story was lie ASPECT_.1 .
6792	1659	POLICY was ASPECT_NEW_POLICY .
6794	1659	He had pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITIONS HE FAILED to list on application .
6795	1659	3 ASPECT_INSURANCE_REGULATION BY ASPECT_STATE_GOVTS allows insurers 2 ASPECT_YEARS to investigate ASPECT_NEW_POLICY for pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITIONS .
6797	1659	man appealed because ASPECT_MAN_PRE-EX was not cancer and ASPECT_MAN had no ASPECT_PRE-EX of cancer .
6799	1659	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY was totally justified in canceling policy for cause , ASPECT_BUT_THEY_DID_RELENT ASPECT_BECAUSE ASPECT_PRE-EX_WAS_NOT_CANCER .
6800	1659	They were NOT forced to relent , ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY choose to cover man cancer ASPECT_TREATMENT and THEY did .
6802	1659	MAN underwent ASPECT_FULL_RANGE of cancer ASPECT_TREATMENT , paid for by ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY .
6804	1659	MAN lived another 4 ASPECT_YEARS after completion of treatment .
6805	1659	But lying ASPECT_OBUMMER said ASPECT_OBUMMER_INSURANCE canceled man policy and OBUMMER died FOR lack OF TREATMENT .
6806	1659	lies to con bad ASPECT_LEGISLATION on public Luckily but brainless ASPECT_SHEEPLE know LUCKILY was lying .
6808	1659	Once policy is in force and past 2 ASPECT_YEAR look back .
6809	1659	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES BY LAW , can not cancel ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE_POLICY for individual except for non-payment of premium .
6810	1660	LAW law of land , and you seem oblivious to fact that people that ASPECT_CONTROL_MONEY are nervous ASPECT_TYPES .
6811	1660	Even baseless ASPECT_RUMOR can cause panic and freeze ASPECT_FUNDS .
6812	1660	Do n't beleive me try to get moderately small ASPECT_BUSINESS_LOAN -LRB- in hundred thousand ASPECT_DOLLAR_RANGE -RRB- .
6813	1660	ME do n't have kind of money but know do and say banks are sitting on KIND as do sources .
6814	1660	First , with due ASPECT_RESPECT and accompanying niceties , do n't attempt to ASPECT_BOX_ME in to your ASPECT_PARAMETERS .
6815	1660	ME was making commentary not ASPECT_DOCTORAL_DISSERTATION or laying out detailed ASPECT_ABSTRACT critiquing ASPECT_ECONOMIC_WOES .
6816	1660	And lastly request .
6817	1660	Please ASPECT_USE_QUOTE_TAGS as matter of ASPECT_COMMON_COURTESY .
6818	1660	When interprets ASPECT_ME_bad ASPECT_GRAMMAR ME don know if they are being accurate , as ME said here before , ME cheated ASPECT_ME_WAY through ASPECT_K3_-RRB- through ASPECT_MIDDLE_SCHOOL_ENGLISH , then ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_and college ASPECT_ENGLISH_GRAMMAR and sometimes math , and now , because of ASPECT_ME_IGNORANCE are paying for IGNORANCE !
6819	1660	So ASPECT_ME_GRAMMAR being bad ASPECT_ME understand if you make wrong ASPECT_ASSUMPTIONS_ETC. .
6820	1660	ASPECT_QUOTE_TAGS make GRAMMAR so much easier and lessen mistaken ASPECT_ASSUMPTIONS and helps everyone .
6821	1660	Ok ASPECT_ME found ASPECT_POST_1654 ASPECT_PAGE_166 ; Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` trouble is ASPECT_WANDERLUST_KID is taking nation down by implementing KID socialist leaning ASPECT_' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- was opinion and -LRB- means ME believe Obama is socialist at heart and will attempt to mould USA into socialist ASPECT_NATION .
6822	1660	that nation will not survive as socialist ASPECT_COUNTRY_IMO , and by taking REPUBLIC down ME meant REPUBLIC won t be capitalist ASPECT_REPRESENTATIVE_DEMOCRATIC_REPUBLIC as IMO is today , but rather type of socialist ASPECT_NATION , with Obama at helm of course .
6823	1660	Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` ill ASPECT_THOUGHT out idealism ' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- ME was suggesting that -RRB- thought things would work by power of -RRB- ASPECT_PERSONALITY_and ASPECT_POPULARITY .
6824	1660	Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` or maybe just wishful ASPECT_FIAT thinking that trillions here and trillions there will come from ` ASPECT_' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- By ME meant that ASPECT_FIAT_CURRENCY is allowing -RRB- to spend trillions , making ASPECT_LOAN_OFFICERS nervous .
6825	1660	ME believe JUST know that are printing money to pay for Obamas trillion ASPECT_DOLLAR_PROJECTS\/RECOVERY_ETCREV said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` and OBAMAS seems to be trying to make like OBAMAS way bad ASPECT_FATHER_SPOILS child .
6826	1660	really need tough love ASPECT_PARENT ... um ' ASPECT_PRESIDENT not perhaps well ASPECT_MEANING but naive ASPECT_ENABLER . '
6827	1660	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- Lastly means that need president will cut back where necessary and do what PRESIDENT must with taxes .
6828	1660	ME don say that lightly ASPECT_ME_lively ASPECT_HOOD depends on how well ASPECT_ME_two ASPECT_NON_profit ASPECT_MISSIONS and churches perform , three which use ASPECT_FEDERAL_GRANTS and ASPECT_PRIVATE_DONATIONS .
6829	1660	Now PERHAPS are performing in red and have been since crash .
6830	1660	Well no , ASPECT_ME_REPLY\/RANT was comment just like of your ASPECT_POSTS_and ASPECT_OTHERS here .
6832	1660	No again , ME vote issues not ASPECT_PARTY .
6833	1660	ME know ME may sound like ASPECT_ME_VOTE by party but is incorrect .
6834	1660	said -LRB- corrected -RRB- ASPECT_ME agree that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_ATROCITY had demonstrable ASPECT_EFFECT on economy at moment , and did not mean to imply that .
6835	1660	No ASPECT_PACKAGE ASPECT_OBAMA_PACKAGE makes have money nervous .
6836	1660	ME am speaking of corporations and lend OUR gadzillion ASPECT_DOLLAR_SUMS .
6837	1660	Until CORPORATIONS have faith and ASPECT_TRUST in Obama recovery is going to drag along .
6839	1664	You think ?
6840	1664	Hey , I think we have discovered why ASPECT_MURDOC_NEWS constantly puts out negative , misleading information about economy !
6841	1664	What is ASPECT_QUOTE_TAG ?
6842	1664	I quoted your ASPECT_WORDS not because of your ASPECT_GRAMMAR but because folks here so often mischaracterize statements , so I try to quote verbatim relevant ASPECT_STATEMENT so as not to mischaracterize .
6843	1664	WE 've been socialist for 85 ASPECT_YEARS now and done OK , have n't WE ?
6844	1664	And WE need to restore revenues by increasing ASPECT_TAXES .
6845	1664	Sorry to hear about your ASPECT_CHURCHES .
6846	1664	Do ASPECT_CHURCHES really get federal ?
6847	1664	I guess started during Bush ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION ?
6848	1664	I had thought was unconstitutional .
6849	1664	OK , so ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION_not ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE after is responsible for tearing nation down .
6850	1664	We 've clarified that .
6851	1664	Instead , it is `` ASPECT_OBAMA_PACKAGE makes have money nervous that is tearing country down .
6852	1664	How is `` ASPECT_OBAMA_PACKAGE doing , and upon want ASPECT_FACTS_or ASPECT_DATA , if , do you have to demonstrate is cause ?
6853	1665	I do n't think Medicare is akin to Insurance .
6854	1665	SS is .
6855	1665	If I said Medicare was I mis-spoke and withdraw MEDICARE .
6856	1665	Medicare is ASPECT_GOVT_NATIONAL_HEALTH_CARE , available only to over 65 .
6857	1665	MEDICARE 's not wrong at .
6858	1665	There is no ASPECT_CONTRACT that guarantees you SS or ASPECT_MEDICARE_BENEFITS .
6859	1665	fact you paid taxes in life does give you entitlements .
6860	1665	I 've never claimed SS is ASPECT_INSURANCE_POLICY .
6861	1665	I 've said POLICY is ASPECT_SOCIAL_INSURANCE , like insurance ASPECT_POOL_RESOURCES and provide benefits if and only if ASPECT_CERTAIN_CONDITIONS_OCCUR .
6862	1665	I 've intimated of sort .
6863	1665	Quit wasting I time with strawmen .
6864	1665	I siad that ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES are for profit and therefore will endeavor to avoid paying benefits by excluding coverage on likely to meet condition for benefits .
6865	1665	Because COVERAGE is irrelevant .
6866	1665	How do you figure ?
6867	1665	I position is logical and factually supported .
6868	1666	You do have sense of humor !
6869	1667	If you worked your ASPECT_LIFE , you paid ASPECT_MEGA_MONEY into Medicare , they just borrowed LIFE and spent ASPECT_LIFE_WRONG !
6870	1667	-LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_HEATHENS !
6871	1667	MONEY 's your ASPECT_MONEY being paid back to you ... Unfortunately , HEATHENS manage MONEY incorrectly , MONEY should not be touched , ever !
6873	1670	women represents ASPECT_WAY_AMERICANS are feeling , unfortunately !
6876	1671	You have sense of ASPECT_DODGING_and ASPECT_DANCING when you have no ASPECT_ARGUMENT .
6877	1672	ASPECT_HA_HA_HA , so funny and maybe true ... maybe not ... .
6878	1673	I 've lumped of above in one ASPECT_QUOTE , since of it shows you to have no ASPECT_KNOWLEDGE of country you live in .
6879	1673	ASPECT_ABOVE_PROGRAMS , Medicare , and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY are INSURANCE .
6880	1673	Both are coverage in exchange for premiums .
6881	1673	One is ASPECT_MEDICAL_COVERAGE , one is ASPECT_SOCIAL_COVERAGE .
6882	1673	And BOTH are 2 `` ASPECT_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAMS .
6883	1673	Entitlements are bad mouthed on both ASPECT_SIDES of aisle , but what ASPECT_BOTH are lumping in with & ASPECT_SS are give away ASPECT_PROGRAMS , which are not entitlements , BOTH are welfare , like subsidized ASPECT_HOUSING , ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS , Medicaid .
6884	1673	2 ASPECT_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAMS have PAID BOTH ASPECT_PREMIUMS .
6885	1673	It is politicians , both ASPECT_PARTIES , have blown Med .
6886	1673	& ASPECT_SS_MONEY on things including welfare ASPECT_PROGRAMS listed above , do not pay in penny but take out Billions per year .
6887	1673	But I digress , Medicare and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY are ASPECT_INSURANCE_PROGRAMS MANDATED by Govt .
6888	1673	We do not have choice of paying for BILLIONS or not .
6889	1673	premiums are taken in form of ASPECT_FICA_TAXES .
6890	1673	Are you in way aware of what F.I.C.A. means ?
6891	1673	ASPECT_FEDERAL_INSURANCE_CONTRIBUTIONS_ACT .
6892	1673	And is separate from ASPECT_INCOME_TAXES .
6893	1673	6.2 ASPECT_&#37; and 1.45 of income is taken FOR ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY_and ASPECT_MEDICARE respectively .
6894	1673	And both are means tested .
6895	1673	Medicare you 've made in your working ASPECT_LIFE , you 've paid in , but you receive only benefit of made ASPECT_MINIMUM_WAGE for 40 ASPECT_QUARTERS of BOTH working ASPECT_LIFE .
6896	1673	Plus if you make over 100,000 and you 're on Medicare , you ASPECT_MONTHLY_PREMIUM is higher than people making less .
6897	1673	Plus in lower ASPECT_INCOME_RANGES can have premiums lower or waived altogether and co-pays reduced or zeroed .
6898	1673	ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , you made , you paid in , benefit you receive .
6899	1673	is means ASPECT_TESTING .
6900	1673	And if one is making over ASPECT_108,000 .
6901	1673	ASPECT_SS_TAX_STOPS , as does accrual of benefit .
6902	1673	Yes , people will get ASPECT_MAX_SS_PAYOUT , but PEOPLE also paid highest ASPECT_PREMIUMS .
6903	1673	And if PEOPLE are still making ASPECT_HIGH_INCOMES ASPECT_PEOPLE_PAY_INCOME_TAX on ASPECT_PEOPLE_SS_BENEFITS at ASPECT_REGULAR_INCOME_TAX_RATES on 50 of benefit , or 85 of benefit depending on ASPECT_PEOPLE_INCOME .
6904	1673	People living on SS alone , do not pay ASPECT_INCOME_TAX on ASPECT_PEOPLE_SS_BENEFITS .
6905	1673	Your ASPECT_POST makes TAX obvious to readers that you either do hate rich or you have been ideologically brainwashed into reciting ASPECT_PRESENT_DAY_liberal ASPECT_LINE .
6906	1673	In years past liberal ASPECT_LINE was ASPECT_TAX_BIG ASPECT_BUSINESS .
6907	1673	But when PEOPLE realized that ASPECT_PUBLIC_KNEW that just meant higher ASPECT_PRICES , liberals changed to `` hate rich ASPECT_NONSENSE .
6908	1673	And you have quite obviously bought into stupidity , wholeheartedly .
6909	1673	Again your ASPECT_BASIC_MISCONCEPTIONS about ASPECT_INSURANCE_SHOW through .
6910	1673	Excluding coverage for WITH pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITIONS is done , with 100 ASPECT_APPROVAL of ASPECT_INSURANCE_REGULATORS -LRB- elected or appointed politicians -RRB- , solely to keep premiums lower for who are transferring risk to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY in exchange for premium .
6911	1673	Covering already needing treatment is transferring ASPECT_COST_, not ASPECT_RISK .
6912	1673	RISK is necessary ASPECT_FACTOR in ASPECT_INSURANCE_EQUATION .
6913	1673	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES ASPECT_CAN_NOT be in business of taking on ASPECT_COSTS , COMPANIES have to take on ASPECT_RISK .
6914	1673	Do n't know why you are UNABLE to grasp ASPECT_SIMPLE_CONCEPT .
6915	1673	Your ASPECT_POSITION is one of misconception , and ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_NONSENSE , and distortions .
6916	1673	And I was being kind to say you have sense of humor .
6917	1673	Your fuzzy ASPECT_GLIMPSE of reality is sad , not funny .
6918	1673	If I was predisposed to feel sorry for people , I 'm not , I 'd feel sorry for you
6919	1674	I can see your ASPECT_POINT .
6920	1674	I 'll agree medicare is like insurance to , in way .
6921	1674	You seem to have mistaken ASPECT_IMPRESSION that ASPECT_POLITICAL_VIEW that wealthy ought to pay taxes equates to hate .
6922	1674	Of ASPECT_COURSE_IMPRESSION does n't .
6923	1674	Cost is function of risk .
6924	1674	I completely understand that person who is aged or has pre-existing ASPECT_CONDITION carries greater ASPECT_RISK of higher ASPECT_COST .
6925	1674	is why for profit ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSURERS will seek to cut out persons .
6926	1674	And why system of ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSURANCE does not work for ASPECT_NATIONAL_HEATH_CARE .
6927	1674	I disagree with your ASPECT_OPINIONS .
6928	1674	Others can decide for OTHERS .
6929	1674	I can tell you are not kind who would feel sorry for people .
6930	1675	And I am very comfortable with .
6931	1675	Feeling sorry for people instead of demanding PEOPLE get off ASPECT_PEOPLE_ASS and haul ASPECT_PEOPLE_LOAD is about ASPECT_70 of problems in country .
6932	1675	I did `` ASPECT_RED because pleases you so .
6933	1675	See I have sense of macabre , err , humor too
6934	1677	There 's no legal ASPECT_CONTRACT with SS , and LIBERAL 'm pretty sure ASPECT_MEDICARE as well .
6935	1677	Again , LIBERAL have no ASPECT_SURPRISE you are not kind would not feel sorry for people and are comfortable with CONTRACT .

6965	1682	is not true .
6966	1682	demand that people pay taxes to reduce ASPECT_HUGE_DEBT you conservatives love to run up .
6967	1683	We love to run up ?
6968	1683	wow , do WE need to show you statistics about Obama compared to Bush ?
6969	1683	You really seem to be mis-informed .
6970	1684	Check statistics of ASPECT_REAGAN_, Bush and ASPECT_BUSH compared to Clinton or president between ASPECT_WWII_and ASPECT_REAGAN and find out I 'm not .
6971	1685	Pardon ASPECT_SHOEY but `` We People bailed out banks , ASPECT_WALL_STREET and ASPECT_GENERAL_MOTORS .

6974	1685	SHOEY am Shoey and message is surely not ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE approved .
6975	1686	GIVEN , past was bad .
6976	1686	How does make BHO , spending at faster ASPECT_RATE than of ASPECT_PAST_PRES ' ASPECT_GOOD ?
6977	1686	PRES were bad , GIVEN is equally guilty and then .
6978	1686	Before HIM make LAME ASPECT_AZZ_EXCUSE for him -LRB- hallmark of ASPECT_GIVEN_PRESIDENCY -RRB- bad ASPECT_PAST_PEOPLE had `` good ASPECT_REASONS for ASPECT_PRES_SPENDING too .

6980	1686	Then and NOW !!
6981	1687	i ASPECT_WILL_NOT_VOTE FOR ASPECT_HIM_AGAIN , ASPECT_HIM_DOES_NOT_HAVE CLUE !
6982	1688	What was good ASPECT_REASON for Bush squandering surplus and running up 5 ASPECT_TRILLION in debt ?
6983	1688	What was good ASPECT_REASON for Reagan taking small ASPECT_DEFICIT and quadrupling DEFICIT and tripling debt ?
6984	1688	Obama inherited worst ASPECT_ECONOMIC_SITUATION since great ASPECT_DEPRESSION mandated fiscal ASPECT_STIMULUS .
6985	1688	I agree OBAMA needs to reduce deficits and should raise taxes and ASPECT_TRIM_SPENDING .
6986	1688	I 've said ASPECT_SITUATION_TIMES .
6987	1689	What you can not comprehend is that they always have `` good ASPECT_REASON .
6988	1689	Same as obummer has `` good ASPECT_REASON .
6989	1689	But THEY good ASPECT_REASON AND obummer good ASPECT_REASONS are simply excuses put out by spenders .
6990	1689	THERE is no good ASPECT_REASONS for spending Trillions we do not have .
6991	1689	There was no good ASPECT_REASON then , there is no good ASPECT_REASON now .
6992	1689	And you need to study history with your ASPECT_EYES_and ASPECT_EARS and mind open .
6993	1689	What ASPECT_OBUMMER faced and faces is about 1\/2 as ASPECT_BAD as what Reagan faced .
6994	1689	Less than half ASPECT_ACTUALLY .
6995	1689	bad ASPECT_ECONOMY , bad unemployment PLUS ASPECT_MASSIVE_DOUBLE_DIGIT_INFLATION .
6996	1689	I lived and worked in days .
6997	1689	If person made 2000 ASPECT_IRA_CONTRIBUTION to bank for 22 ASPECT_YEARS , at interest ASPECT_RATE_BANKS were paying for ASPECT_ORDINARY_CD , they would become millionaire .
6998	1689	You could go to ASPECT_GROCERY_STORE week later and buy ASPECT_GROCERY_LIST and pay 20 , 25.00 for goods .
6999	1689	Did ASPECT_REAGAN_BELIEVE_BELIEVE had good ASPECT_REASON for spending like BELIEVE did ?
7000	1689	Sure ASPECT_BELIEVE did .
7001	1689	But we are paying today for precedent ASPECT_BELIEVE set then .
7002	1689	as WE will pay for obummer idiocy .
7003	1689	WE will suffer in future for obummer ASPECT_POLICIES_TODAY , PLUS ASPECT_INFLATION WILL run wild again .
7004	1689	ASPECT_CHEMO_TREATMENT is 100 effective against cancer is useless if PLAN also kills patient .
7005	1689	was oBum ASPECT_TREATMENT_PLAN except PLAN is killing patient AND PLAN is not effective .
7006	1689	But PLAN IS more expensive than anything else ever tried in history .
7007	1690	During sever ASPECT_RECESSION there are very good ASPECT_REASONS to increase spending .
7008	1690	creates ASPECT_DEMAND_and ASPECT_PICKS up slack caused by overreaction of ASPECT_MARKETS_and ASPECT_ECONOMY to lessen ASPECT_FULL_EFFECT of recession or recessionary ASPECT_SPIRAL into depression .
7009	1690	Interest ASPECT_RATES were high because of Fed actions to kill inflation , but Reagan inhereted economy where ASPECT_RELATIVE_SIZE of debt was lowest in 45 ASPECT_YEARS and economy was growing at 7 ASPECT_+ &#37; real .
7010	1690	Obama inherited ASPECT_RECORD_DEFICITS , highest ASPECT_RELATIVE_DEBT in 60 ASPECT_YEARS , and ASPECT_ECONOMY_TANKING at -7 .
7011	1690	Easy ASPECT_CHOICE which ASPECT_ONE I 'd rather walk into .
7012	1690	Depends on what you mean .
7013	1690	Relatively Govt spent far on WWII and probably close to for Reagans ASPECT_MILITARY_BUILDUP .
7014	1690	And in perspective , spending on stimulus is no more than cost of mistaken ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR , and really only ASPECT_COUPLE_YEARS ASPECT_EXTRA_annual ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING compared to 2000 .
7015	1692	Not true .
7016	1692	Obama has spent like mad ASPECT_MAN .
7017	1692	Keep drinking kool-aid .
7019	1692	You mean accept .
7020	1692	Not going to matter in November once republicans control everything , have fun ... you only have months left .
7021	1692	Please elaborate on good ASPECT_CHOICES .
7022	1692	I ca n't seem to think of , oh 's because there are none .
7023	1692	ASPECT_EVERYTHING_COMMANDER does is to redistribute wealth .
7024	1692	unemployment ASPECT_RATE has gone way up .
7025	1692	COMMANDER lied times about ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE .
7026	1692	problem is COMMANDER does everything is unpopular .
7027	1692	COMMANDER is supposed to follow what people want .
7028	1692	ASPECT_EVERYTHING_COMMANDER does is opposite of ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPINION .
7029	1692	In words there are people upset than happy .
7030	1692	Yeah since COMMANDER had choice Obama has only continued war , drones left and right .
7031	1692	Well COMMANDER is commander in chief , is COMMANDER ASPECT_JOB .
7032	1692	As for criticism ... People are finally catching on to COMMANDER ASPECT_NON-SENSE , even ASPECT_PEOPLE who fell for CRITICISM in place .
7033	1692	Hell yes we are going to criticize NON-SENSE when NON-SENSE is spending ASPECT_WE_MONEY like MONEY grows on trees to give to people who do .
7034	1692	No , NO does n't .
7035	1692	WE are n't moving to ASPECT_SOCIALIST\/COMMUNIST_NATION .
7036	1692	Why give second ASPECT_CHANCE ?
7037	1692	NO 's not going to change NO ASPECT_IDEAS .
7038	1692	NO is set on running ASPECT_AMERICA straight into ground .
7039	1694	You 're right .
7040	1694	They have to run on .
7041	1694	Only bash side .
7042	1695	DEMOCRAT ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_TOPICS , Its ASPECT_BUSH fault .
7043	1695	Tax rich .
7044	1695	FAULT FOX fault .
7045	1695	Spend , but do n't call FAULT ASPECT_STIMULUS .
7046	1695	FAULT Beck fault .
7047	1695	Tax rich .
7048	1695	FAULT was worse then we `` thought .
7049	1695	`` Spend more .

7059	1695	Tax rich .
7060	1695	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is dangerous .
7061	1695	Spend .
7062	1695	FAULT fault .
7063	1695	Tax rich .
7064	1695	Republican just say no , FAULT not fault .
7065	1695	Spend .
7066	1695	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is racist .
7067	1695	ASPECT_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX_XNO_PLATFORM , NO ASPECT_PROGRAMS other than spend wildly .
7068	1695	Just whine and blame everybody but themselves .
7069	1696	Foregoing obvious ASPECT_QUIP about ASPECT_CERTAIN_recent ASPECT_PRESIDENT , US 'd have to nominate ASPECT_JAMES_K_POLK as worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT in ASPECT_US_HISTORY , considering fact that PRESIDENT started blatant ASPECT_WAR of aggression and ASPECT_TERRITORIAL_EXPANSION on flimsiest of pretexts , and nearly started another ASPECT_WAR with Britain for ASPECT_SIMILAR_REASONS .
7070	1696	As for Obama , US would say that OBAMA done remarkable ASPECT_JOB under very adverse ASPECT_CIRCUMSTANCES , and even if ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY ended today , OBAMA 'd be remembered as notable ASPECT_PRESIDENT with accomplishments .
7071	1696	Let examine point by point : - `` OBAMA has not kept of ASPECT_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN promises .
7073	1696	Let check .
7074	1696	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM ?
7076	1696	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_STIMULUS ?
7078	1696	Financial ASPECT_REFORM ?
7080	1696	Winding down war in Iraq ?
7082	1696	Sending forces to Afghanistan ?
7084	1696	Improving nation infrastructure ?
7086	1696	Building ASPECT_GREEN_ECONOMY ?
7088	1696	Err , which promises did you have in mind , exactly ?
7089	1696	For complete ASPECT_RUNDOWN on promises kept or broken , look here : http:\/\/politifact.com\/truth-o-meter\/promises\/ - `` ERR has not been transparent .
7090	1696	`` Compared to what ?
7091	1696	ASPECT_LUMINIFEROUS_AETHER ?
7092	1696	While Obama certainly could have done better in regard , COMPARED certainly made improvements compared to COMPARED predecessors .
7093	1696	For example , you can track exactly where ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY is going at http:\/\/www.recovery.gov\/Pages\/home.aspx - `` YOU has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no ASPECT_TAX_CUT for 95 of Americans -RRB- .
7094	1696	`` Well duh .
7095	1696	who was elected President in 2008 would have had to raise taxes at point .
7096	1696	Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS were simply irresponsible and unsustainable .
7097	1696	- `` BUSH has increased spending\/size of government to record ASPECT_LEVELS .
7098	1696	`` You 're talking about ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL ?
7099	1696	BUSH will remind YOU that two ASPECT_YEARS ago economists from over ASPECT_POLITICAL_SPECTRUM were warning of very ASPECT_DANGER of second Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
7100	1696	In case YOU 've forgotten YOU ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_HISTORY , Great Depression involved unemployment ASPECT_RATES in neighborhood of 25 , thousands of ASPECT_BANK_FAILURES , ASPECT_HUGE_NUMBERS of American forced to lived in Hoovervilles - ASPECT_MAKESHIFT_CAMPS for homeless .
7101	1696	YOU really think averting ASPECT_ECONOMIC_COLLAPSE is n't worth spending ASPECT_MONEY on ?
7102	1696	- `` YOU has \/ will increase THOUSANDS ASPECT_DEFICIT to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS .
7103	1696	`` So ASPECT_HUGE_RECURRING , ASPECT_STRUCTURAL_DEFICIT to fund ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for rich is okie-dokie , but one ASPECT_TIME_emergency ASPECT_EXPENDITURE is end of world ?
7104	1696	And were n't you just complaining about taxes being raised ?
7105	1696	Make up YOU mind - YOU ca n't have YOU cake and eat CAKE too .
7106	1696	- `` YOU ignores ASPECT_PEOPLE_and ASPECT_PUSHES through legislation way YOU can .
7107	1696	`` Errr , were n't ASPECT_ERRR_criticizing ASPECT_CLINTON just ASPECT_YEARS ago for making ASPECT_POLICY_DECISIONS based on polling ?
7108	1696	And YOU seem to recall pretty constant ASPECT_COMPLAINTS about `` Do ASPECT_CONGRESS .
7109	1696	You should really make up your ASPECT_MIND which you want .
7110	1696	- `` YOU has weakened ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY\/BORDER_SECURITY .
7111	1696	`` How exactly ?
7112	1696	Obama has reduced stress on severely ASPECT_OVEREXTENDED US military .
7113	1696	world ASPECT_STANDING has greatly improved and 're seeing cooperation both from traditional ASPECT_ALLIES and from world ASPECT_POWERS such as ASPECT_RUSSIA_and ASPECT_CHINA .
7114	1696	Honestly , just ASPECT_RUNNING around world threatening to bomb do n't like does not make US secure .
7115	1696	Considering that JUST greatly reduces credibility of threats of ASPECT_MILITARY_FORCE , YOU 'd say JUST does opposite .
7116	1696	As for border , if anything , Obama has increased ASPECT_BORDER_ENFORCEMENT compared to Bush .
7117	1696	- `` OBAMA has ASPECT_SEVERAL_proposed ASPECT_POLICIES will hurt Americans and ASPECT_ECONOMY .
7118	1696	`` as what ?
7119	1696	OBAMA really have no ASPECT_IDEA what you 're on about with one .
7120	1696	YOU consider ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY leads to 9 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT rather then 25 to have hurt economy ?
7121	1696	How exactly do YOU figure ?
7122	1696	- `` YOU is shunning allies and kissing asses of enemies .
7123	1696	`` who ever uttered words `` freedom ASPECT_FRIES has absolutely no ASPECT_ROOM to speak on subject .
7124	1696	friends tell you when you 're making mistake .
7125	1696	People who simply go along with anything and everything you want are n't friends , PEOPLE 're sycophants .
7126	1696	And have you ever considered actually asking allies what ALLIES think of matter ?
7127	1696	Obama is very popular in Europe and rest of world .
7128	1696	US happened to be on trip to England on ASPECT_ELECTION_DAY 2008 -LRB- US voted by absentee ASPECT_BALLOT -RRB- and when US went to airport to come back , guy at ASPECT_CUSTOMS_DESK gave US hearty ASPECT_CONGRATULATIONS on Obama election when GUY saw US US passport .
7129	1696	As for enemies , Iran , at least , is in , weaker ASPECT_POSITION now then IRAN was two ASPECT_YEARS ago .
7130	1696	Between ASPECT_INTERNAL_DISSENSION -LRB- Which Obama encouraged by holding out hand in ASPECT_OBAMA_INAUGURAL -RRB- and growing international ASPECT_OPPOSITION -LRB- Thanks to ASPECT_OBAMA_ENGAGING in diplomacy -RRB- Ahmadinejad regime has gone from being on verge of ASPECT_REGIONAL_DOMINATION to severely hemmed in and with options .
7131	1696	- `` OBAMA continues to spew lies and BS to ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE .
7132	1696	`` Unless you 'd care to provide examples , is meaningless ASPECT_INSULT on about ASPECT_LEVEL of accusing Obama of having cooties .
7133	1696	To sum up , although Obama has been far from perfect and can certainly be criticized on points , over OBAMA done quite good ASPECT_JOB under very adverse ASPECT_CIRCUMSTANCES .
7134	1696	Yes , economy still sucks , but YOU know what ?
7135	1696	President ca n't simply order prosperity to return .
7136	1696	ASPECT_US_ECONOMY is massive with mind of THING own that government has limited ASPECT_MEANS to influence .
7137	1696	There really is n't magic ASPECT_WAND in safe in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE somewhere .
7138	1696	Well , unless YOU 're advocating change to ASPECT_COMMAND_ECONOMY ... Things are much better then they would have been otherwise .
7139	1696	Why Democrats are n't running on is puzzle to US .
7140	1696	commentators seem to think is too complex argument for ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTERS to grasp .
7141	1696	US sincerely hope COMMENTATORS 're wrong .
7142	1696	So yes , US will very likely vote to re-elect Obama .
7143	1696	And no , US almost certainly would n't vote for Palin .
7144	1696	Regardless of what YOU think of NO ASPECT_POLITICS , Palin has demonstrated disturbingly weak ASPECT_GRASP of issues and NO ASPECT_COMPETENCE to perform duties of office are questionable at best .
7145	1697	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CAMPAIGN_TOPICSITS_OBAMA fault .
7146	1697	Cut taxes for rich .
7147	1697	FAULT MSM fault .
7148	1697	Spend , but do n't call FAULT ASPECT_STIMULUS .
7149	1697	FAULT Biden fault .
7150	1697	Cut taxes for rich .
7151	1697	It is worse that FAULT is .
7152	1697	Borrow .
7153	1697	Sarah who ?
7154	1697	Cut taxes for rich .
7155	1697	people are dumb !
7156	1697	Borrow .
7157	1697	Its ASPECT_TEA_PARTY fault .
7158	1697	Cut taxes for rich .
7159	1697	Obama is racist .
7160	1697	Spend .
7161	1697	Kick them out , THEM 've had control since ASPECT_JAN_2009 !
7162	1697	Cut taxes for rich .
7163	1697	liberals are dangerous .
7164	1697	Borrow .
7165	1697	Its fault .
7166	1697	Cut taxes for rich .
7167	1697	Everything is Obama fault .
7168	1697	Spend .
7169	1697	Blacks are racists .
7170	1697	Cut taxes for rich .
7171	1698	He certainly was not ASPECT_ONE of best .
7172	1698	I almost fell off I ASPECT_CHAIR laughing at one .
7173	1698	of promises kept will be detrimental to economy .
7174	1698	HE stimulus certainly has not panned out .
7175	1698	Obamacare will most certainly be disastrous , and Americans favor repeal .
7176	1698	OBAMA is doing somewhat better , I believe , but not to ASPECT_DEGREE_OBAMA said OBAMA would , and certainly only after pressure to do so .
7177	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA_STIMULUS is very questionable at to whether STIMULUS had any affect on economy other than increasing deficit .
7178	1698	One-time emergency ASPECT_EXPENDITURE ?
7179	1698	You have n't been paying attention to ASPECT_OBAMA_SPENDING and projected ASPECT_DEFICITS OBAMA will incur .
7180	1698	They are history-making and record-breaking .
7181	1698	I was not complaining about Clinton , personally .
7182	1698	Americans were against Obamacare because Americans know SPENDING will not do what ASPECT_OBAMA thinks SPENDING will .
7183	1698	Obama is viewed as weak by countries .
7184	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA_apology ASPECT_TOUR certainly has not helped .
7185	1698	of Obama actions on border were ASPECT_LIP_SERVICE .
7186	1698	National guards troops without ASPECT_ENFORCEMENT_AUTHORITY or ASPECT_LOADED_WEAPONS .
7187	1698	OBAMA 600 million ASPECT_INCREASE in ASPECT_BORDER_FUNDING is drop in bucket of what OBAMA should be doing .
7188	1698	ASPECT_HID_DOHS has suspended ASPECT_SEVERAL_administrative ASPECT_CHECKS regarding status of folks in U.S. allows for illegal ASPECT_ACTIVITY .
7189	1698	OBAMA said STATUS would stay under 8 , yet has gone to 10 .
7190	1698	What makes you think OBAMA had anything to do with numbers not getting worse ?
7191	1698	Maybe ASPECT_FOLKS would not have reached 10 if Obama left ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR alone and did n't spend like ASPECT_PARIS_HILTON on Rodeo ASPECT_DRIVE .
7192	1698	OBAMA may have been popular before election , and shortly thereafter , but now OBAMA is not .
7193	1698	I am in Europe at least once month on business , and OBAMA is not that popular ASPECT_ANYMORE .
7194	1698	folks view Obama as just ASPECT_TYPICAL_POLITICIAN and of .
7195	1698	Obama continues to live in ASPECT_PIPE_DREAM believing OBAMA policies are helping economy .
7196	1698	OBAMA pushes Obamacare even though fear ASPECT_DREAM , and Americans want DREAM repealed .
7197	1698	scary is that I really think Obama thinks OBAMA is right with ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICIES , even though are against OBAMA .
7198	1698	Just ASPECT_SPECULATION .
7199	1698	I am not sure Palin is right ASPECT_PERSON for job .
7200	1698	I certainly think PERSON is smart ASPECT_LADY , and just does n't act like ASPECT_TYPICAL_POLITICIAN .
7201	1698	PERSON could certainly do no ASPECT_WORSE that Obama , IMO .
7202	1698	Obama is good ASPECT_BS-ER .
7203	1698	OBAMA actually had no ASPECT_EXPERIENCE_or ASPECT_CREDENTIALS to be POTUS .
7204	1698	EXPERIENCE is also very clear , according to poll , that Obama is not very popular anymore .
7206	1699	- You must be filthy rich or ASPECT_JUST ASPECT_COMMITTED_TEA_PARTY_ENTHUSIAST .
7207	1699	YOU travel only to thread , and time , YOU see ASPECT_MULTIPLE_POSTS by you are nothing more than opinionated ASPECT_NONSENSE , full of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_RHETORIC knowledgable , in ASPECT_TOUCH_PERSON can refute .
7208	1699	And , when they do -- as YOU have on occasion -- ASPECT_DAN-NO_REBUTTAL is more of opinionated ASPECT_NONSENSE .
7209	1699	Like conservatives , your ASPECT_POSTS reveal that you `` think ?
7210	1699	posting stuff over and over will convince others you have argument .
7211	1699	-- -- -- YOU -- -- !!!!!!
7212	1699	You are like biting ASPECT_FLY that pesters person until solution is `` ASPECT_SWAT , so , here 's mine --
7213	1700	Please tell me one 's incorrect on his ASPECT_LIST ... ONE
7214	1701	First , you do n't know what ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is .
7215	1701	You only know what your ASPECT_BRAINWASHING_ELITISTS tell you to think .
7216	1701	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , simply put , is overwhelming ASPECT_MAJORITY of ASPECT_AMERICAN_CITIZENS .
7217	1701	ASPECT_MAINSTREAM_AMERICA IS ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , actually ASPECT_JOIN , others are just sympathetic to ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_IDEAS .
7218	1701	And everything I posted that elicited your derogatory ASPECT_QUOTE is accurate ASPECT_DEPICTION of liberal ASPECT_STATEMENTS .
7219	1701	Made over and over and over .
7220	1701	-- -- -- I -- -- !!!!!!
7221	1701	Yes conservatives DO have ASPECT_OPINIONS , based in ASPECT_REALITY_and ASPECT_TRUTH .
7222	1701	Your ASPECT_QUOTE_PROVES that liberals have opinions too .
7223	1701	Based in beautiful ASPECT_THEORIES can not continue .
7224	1701	You liberals want things for persons , beautiful , wonderful ASPECT_GOAL .
7225	1701	Talk to CHARITIES , not ASPECT_GOVERNMENTS .
7226	1702	READERS Please Note !!!
7227	1702	Conservatives like to ASPECT_HAWK_READERS `` views but seldom supply `` unbiased ASPECT_SOURCES for ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_`` ASPECT_FACTS .
7228	1702	Research of ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_`` ASPECT_FACTS shows ASPECT_HEAVY_, ASPECT_FUNDAMENTAL_RELIANCE on ASPECT_REPUBLICAN\/TEA_PARTY_PROPAGANDA .
7229	1702	When challenged for ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_PROPAGANDA , CONSERVATIVES change subject or ignore challenge completely .
7230	1702	Thus , is ASPECT_NOT_DEBATE , but biased , ASPECT_SINGLE_MINDED_rehearsed ASPECT_TIRADE of unfounded , opinionated ASPECT_RHETORIC .
7231	1702	Now , I am quick to remind that NOW perfectly OK to have opinion and to post OPINION no ASPECT_MATTER how perverse or ill-advised , BUT , in ASPECT_AMERICAN_DEMOCRACY , we people , have means to research material and when one does , one is not surprised to discover just how ASPECT_SLANTED_and unfounded conservative ASPECT_PROPAGANDA is .
7232	1702	Here 's example : Both ASPECT_DAN-NO40_and ASPECT_ONALANDLINE deride `` ASPECT_STIMULUS .
7233	1702	How about report just released ASPECT_TODAY by WH and confirmed in article in ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST : Report gives ASPECT_STIMULUS_HIGH_MARKS by ASPECT_LORI_MONTGOMERY .
7234	1702	ASPECT_READ_REPORT and judge for yourself .
7235	1702	Facts are ASPECT_FACTS_and ASPECT_OPINION is just -- opinion !
7236	1704	TRIFLE may be that 20 ASPECT_YEARS is your `` ASPECT_RIGHT time to evaluate ASPECT_CURRENT_PRESIDENT , but TRIFLE trifle `` long term for me -- and perhaps for you depending upon your ASPECT_AGE .
7237	1704	ME was around when Reagan was president and even tho ' ASPECT_ME voted for Nixon , ME found Reagan to be ASPECT_B-PICTURE_actor `` ASPECT_ACTING like president .
7238	1704	ASPECT_REAGAN_best ASPECT_PERFORMANCE was convincing ASPECT_EVERYONE_REAGAN was `` good ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
7239	1704	Further , REAGAN likely had Alzheimer when ASPECT_REAGAN was in WH , and it was reported that REAGAN was often caught ` ASPECT_NODDING ' off during meetings .
7240	1704	Personally , ME prefer to depend on who ASPECT_CAN be aroused at 2 AM with emergency .
7241	1704	ME am Independent , and ME agree that ASPECT_BRATBOY_BUSH was worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT during ASPECT_ME_LIFETIME .
7242	1704	ME did not support Obama during 2008 ASPECT_CAMPAIGN -LRB- ME supported Hillary and was very angry with DNC for taking Texas away from HILLARY and ` giving ' ASPECT_TEXAS to Obama and for ignoring 18 million ASPECT_VOTES HILLARY got nationally .
7243	1704	ASPECT_ME_blame Ted ASPECT_KENNEDY for bit of ` ASPECT_POLITICAL_SLIGHT of hand . '
7244	1704	ME never supported Kennedy , either -RRB- .
7245	1704	But , there is NO ASPECT_WAY_ME can support ASPECT_POLITICAL_PERFIDY permeates ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY since Reagan .
7246	1704	people are ` off charts ' when comes to ASPECT_REASON_and ASPECT_PROFFERING_PEOPLE ` facts ' as truth .
7247	1704	PEOPLE are pro-wealth and corporate ASPECT_PERSONHOOD -LRB- Corporations are ASPECT_NOT_human ASPECT_AND have one ASPECT_PURPOSE : to make profit .
7248	1704	Constitution was written FOR preservation of ` human ' ASPECT_LIFE_, liberty and ASPECT_PURSUIT of happiness , ASPECT_NOT_profit ASPECT_-RRB- .
7249	1704	CONSTITUTION is ASPECT_ME_OPINION that conservatives on SCOTUS are group of ASPECT_ANTI-CONSTITUTIONAL_NINCOMPOOPS !
7250	1704	best Obama has done so far , in ASPECT_ME_VIEW , is to nominate 2 ASPECT_WOMEN to Court .
7251	1704	brilliant ASPECT_WOMEN have faced ASPECT_SLINGS_and ASPECT_ARROWS of sex ASPECT_DISCRIMINATION by `` good ASPECT_OLE_BOYS ' ASPECT_CLUB and likely will write opinions based on humanitarian rather than corporate ASPECT_NEEDS when WOMEN must judge of ASPECT_CRACKPOT_LAWS Republican dominated Congress passed and both ASPECT_GWB_and ASPECT_WJC signed into law .
7252	1704	As for so called ` ASPECT_BLUE_DOG ' ASPECT_DEMOCRATS , DEMOCRATS 're now simply out of closet ASPECT_HOMOGAMETIC_REPUBLICANS .
7253	1704	May ASPECT_DEMOCRATS_rue ASPECT_DEMOCRATS_VOTES to DEMOCRATS ASPECT_POLITICAL_DEATHBED .
7254	1706	You have serious ASPECT_ISSUES and should seek counseling !
7255	1706	And `` ASPECT_POLITICIANS_LIE is not newsflash .
7256	1706	Both ASPECT_PARTIES_ARE and have been guilty of taking anything out of context and using NEWSFLASH to ASPECT_PARTIES_best ASPECT_ADVANTAGE .
7257	1706	For instance , Reid did say what REID is claimed to have said , IS FACT .
7258	1706	Using FACT in manner other than how REID meant FACT IS politics .
7259	1706	ASPECT_SIMPLE_FACT , obummer came in with 69 ASPECT_APPROVAL .
7260	1706	Today 30 of public says PUBLIC would vote to re-elect REID .
7261	1706	's public saying that , not politicians .
7262	1707	Go to ASPECT_LOG_Cabin ASPECT_REPUBLICANS.COM and see gay ASPECT_PEOPLE who are normal , ASPECT_MEDIA_REPORTS them undignified on purpose ... Democrats exploit THEM and give THEM ASPECT_HOPE in election , but never deliver ... Jollee
7263	1709	hELL NO !
7264	1709	LIKE ASPECT_ASKING_ME IF i ASPECT_WANT ASPECT_ECONOMY_TOO_FAIL ASPECT_FOREVER !
7266	1710	I think failure of economy would do us good .
7267	1710	FAILURE would highlight ASPECT_INHERENT_FAILINGS of Capitalism .
7268	1710	Capitalism is UNSUSTAINABLE .
7269	1710	Capitalism is defined by competition .
7270	1710	question generation -LRB- ASPECT_BREATHING_-RRB- faces , is : what happens when wins ?
7271	1710	power wielded by winners - is I want folks to contemplate .
7273	1713	Readers , please note : ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE ?
7274	1713	ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST ?
7275	1713	Certainly unbiased ASPECT_SOURCES .
7278	1714	Are you serious ?
7279	1714	One of biased ASPECT_WEBSITES owned by ASPECT_OBAMA_CRONIES .
7280	1715	Power wielded by winners is clearly thousands of ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_POINTS better than power wielded by LOSERS .
7281	1715	Humans have brains allow us to out think animals .
7282	1715	And US make better ASPECT_USE of tools than animals .
7283	1715	But make no ASPECT_MISTAKE , US live in jungle as animals do .
7284	1715	Ours is often made of concrete and ASPECT_STEEL now , instead of trees .
7285	1715	But US only changed CONCRETE ASPECT_APPEARANCE , ASPECT_JUNGLE_STILL jungle and always will be .
7286	1715	And losers do not rule jungle anywhere .
7287	1715	And never will .
7288	1715	Capitalism IS unbreakable ASPECT_LAW of jungle .
7289	1715	Liberalism can temporarily prostitute that law , but LAW can not even begin to fundamentally change LAW .
7290	1715	want to live productive ASPECT_LIVES_and ASPECT_PROSPER , will !
7291	1715	others will get what ASPECT_OTHERS have earned .
7292	1715	To say , `` Capitalism is UNSUSTAINABLE , is to be completely out of touch with reality .
7293	1716	we would have needed it 3 ASPECT_REPUBLICANS to believe in gay ASPECT_RIGHTS and WE would have had ASPECT_OPEN_GAYS in military .
7294	1716	3 ASPECT_REPUBLICANS .
7295	1716	Do n't give me that democrats do n't deliver -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- .
7296	1716	DEMOCRATS worked ASPECT_DEMOCRATS_ASS off for gay ASPECT_RIGHTS and republicans said no ASPECT_TO yet another ASPECT_CIVIL_RIGHTS_ISSUE .
7297	1717	Now , for another ASPECT_LESSON in ` ASPECT_TRUTHINESS : `` Therefore , if you KNOW what ASPECT_POLITICIAN_or ASPECT_PUNDIT_SAYS is lie , then NOW ` ASPECT_FREEDOM of speech ' for YOU to continue to spread lie ?
7298	1717	On what moral ASPECT_COMPASS do YOU set philosophy ?
7299	1717	On what serpent in Garden of Eden had to say , perhaps ?
7300	1717	's kind of collective ASPECT_DISHONESTY that ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and THEREFORE conservative ASPECT_FELLOW_TRAVELERS use to spread TRAVELERS ASPECT_UNAMERICAN_PHILOSOPHY of ' ASPECT_POLITICAL_HATRED , ' and TRAVELERS unreasonable ASPECT_GOAL to foster ASPECT_GOVERNMENTAL_TURMOIL and ASPECT_EVENTUAL_DESTRUCTION in stable ASPECT_DEMOCRACY .
7301	1717	How can ASPECT_TEA_PARTY\/CONSERVATIVE_REPUBLICAN_PARTY justify philosophy without undermining Constitutional ASPECT_IDEALS of ` human ' ASPECT_LIFE , liberty and pursuit of happiness and that ` men -LRB- mankind -RRB- are created equal ? '
7302	1717	Again , Obama popularity is NOT question supporting thread .
7303	1717	YEARS , `` Would you vote for Obama in 2010 ?
7304	1717	's 2 ASPECT_YEARS from now .
7305	1717	In politics , 's eternity .
7306	1717	IOW , just another ASPECT_EXAMPLE of conservative distraction and ASPECT_MANIPULATION to distort facts to suit YOU ASPECT_POLITICAL_PURPOSES .
7307	1717	of us are not so intellectually ignorant or ` needy ASPECT_' for ASPECT_POLITICAL_` ASPECT_PURIFICATION . '
7308	1718	Since you have hooked up ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_REPUBLICANS , it is obvious that you have not looked into it for yourself .
7309	1718	YOU are simply repeating and spreading liberal ASPECT_LIES .
7310	1718	What conservative ASPECT_REPUBLICANS , or moderate ASPECT_REPUBLICANS , or radical ASPECT_REPUBLICANS , have to say does not matter to me than what Democrats of ilk have to say .
7311	1718	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY does not speak for ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and ASPECT_TEA_PARTY does not speak for ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY .
7312	1718	Democrats and ASPECT_REPUBLICANS ARE ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTIES .
7313	1718	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is not ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY , PARTY is ASPECT_GRASS_ROOTS_MOVEMENT of MAJORITY of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC .
7314	1718	PARTY does not speak with one ASPECT_VOICE , nor is PARTY coordinated .
7315	1718	liberal ASPECT_MEDIA demonizes ASPECT_TEA_PARTY because PARTIES fear PARTY .
7316	1718	Not for violence , but that liberal ASPECT_MEDIA is afraid of losing ASPECT_PARTY_POWER .
7317	1718	And POWER will , precisely because media SHOULD be reporting ASPECT_FACTS_and ASPECT_EVENTS as PARTIES ARE , NOT as PARTIES 'd like PARTIES to be .
7318	1718	Rather than vomiting out pablum your liberal ASPECT_LOONIES have taught you , you should go and see ASPECT_TEA_PARTY for yourself and with ASPECT_OPEN_MIND .
7319	1718	What you will see is AMERICA working way it is supposed to work .
7320	1718	For people , by people .
7321	1718	You should be embracing America rather than helping spread lies by elitists afraid of losing ASPECT_PEOPLE_POWERS .
7322	1718	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is not ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY , but AMERICA is already larger than either ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY or ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY .
7323	1719	Are you claiming that ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST has liberal ASPECT_BIAS ???
7324	1719	: ASPECT_LAUGHING : Maybe was case in 1970 , but is certainly not case in 2010 .
7325	1719	If anything , Post has right ASPECT_WING_BIAS , not way around .
7326	1720	vote was 56 to 43 .
7327	1720	Yet there are 41 ASPECT_REPUBLICANS .
7328	1720	You ASPECT_DID_NOT get ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC\/INDEPENDENT_vote ASPECT_EITHER .
7329	1720	So HOW is HOW Republicans ASPECT_FAULT ?
7330	1720	Why are you not pointing finger at your dissenting ASPECT_DEMOCRATS ?????
7331	1720	For well over ASPECT_YEAR_DEMOCRATS had held 60 to 40 super ASPECT_MAJORITY .
7332	1720	Yet they constantly claimed Republicans were blocking everything , ASPECT_MATHEMATICAL_IMPOSSIBILITY .
7333	1720	Now Dems hold 59 to 41 ASPECT_ADVANTAGE .
7334	1720	When vote is 59 to 41 , THEN you can gripe about Republicans , but 43 never is 59-41 .
7335	1720	Get your ASPECT_GROUP in order , then complain .
7336	1720	Until then blaming Republicans is just ASPECT_ANOTHER in , , ASPECT_LINE of liberal ASPECT_EXCUSES and avoiding blame for ASPECT_THEN_SHORTCOMINGS .
7337	1721	LIBERAL could n't possibly agree with you , and LIBERAL am liberal .
7338	1721	It is lie to convince people who are ASPECT_LEFT_WING to continue to support corporatist , decidedly not ASPECT_LEFT_WING_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY .
7339	1721	So ASPECT_PEOPLE_lie and blame ASPECT_REPUBLICANS .
7340	1721	Well Democrats are not that stupid .
7341	1721	Democrats understand math , and know that for about ASPECT_YEAR , Democrats could have done whatever ASPECT_PEOPLE felt like .
7342	1721	PEOPLE could have passed progressive ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM , included ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION .
7343	1721	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM benefited ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE , by insuring uninsured and lowering premiums for rest of us .
7344	1721	Instead what US got was handout to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES .
7345	1721	COMPANIES continue to try to blame Republicans for ASPECT_COMPANIES_LACK of progress , but reality is COMPANIES are owned by corporate and special ASPECT_INTERESTS Republicans are .
7346	1721	COMPANIES have simply convinced ASPECT_PEOPLE_COMPANIES are party of people .
7347	1721	is lie , US have 2 ASPECT_PARTIES of rich and powerful , and ASPECT_NONE who are for poor or ASPECT_IMPORTANTLY ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS .
7348	1722	When we really think about it , IT 's astonishing how influence ASPECT_BLUE_DOGS in Senate have .
7349	1722	actions eventually led to ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION being dropped , resulting in poor ASPECT_LEGISLATION is major ASPECT_REASON_DEMOCRATS are being -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ted on in polls .
7350	1723	I do n't even think it is only ASPECT_BLUE_DOGS anyways .
7351	1723	Ultimately ASPECT_BLUE_DOGS are beholden to ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY_LEADERSHIP .
7352	1723	If party does not fund campaigns , will have hard ASPECT_TIME raising money , unless are particularly charismatic .
7353	1723	TIME is fault of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY_LEADERSHIP .
7354	1723	could have gotten better ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL through if had ASPECT_POLITICAL_WILL to do so , but did n't .
7355	1724	Well 's included in whole ASPECT_SITUATION but allow to do what want and we see what happened .
7356	1724	If OBAMA 'm Reid , Pelosi , Obama , and ASPECT_DNC_LEADERSHIP OBAMA tell to back or ASPECT_GONNA 're gonna have to end up passing crappy ASPECT_LEGISLATION , which is what happened .
7357	1724	Ultimately , one ASPECT_PARTY is out of collective ASPECT_MINDS , and is too much of wuss to get anything ASPECT_SUBSTANTIAL done .
7358	1726	than ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES .
7359	1726	Obama has been at odds with ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE on almost ASPECT_ISSUE since OBAMA took office .
7361	1727	guy has been giving ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_SPEECHES and pushing ASPECT_GUY_AGENDA at ASPECT_FULL_SPEED since taking ASPECT_OFFICE .
7362	1728	So YOU subtract 288 ASPECT_BILLION from stimulus and divide remainder by 2.5 million ASPECT_JOBS will eventually be created and YOU get that job has cost 210,400.00 .
7363	1728	you consider good ?
7364	1728	YOU consider good ASPECT_REASON to go another trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS in debt ?
7365	1728	ASPECT_NEW_ORLEANS_LEVEES ?
7366	1728	YOU have spent billions to fix and improve levees over 100 ASPECT_YEARS .
7367	1728	Not 10 ASPECT_CENTS on dollar has ever reached levees .
7369	1728	AND N.O. could teach Chicago ASPECT_THINGS about corruption and ASPECT_GRAFT , and is really saying .
7370	1728	And infrastructure ?
7371	1728	Indeed do repairs , was what `` ASPECT_SHOVEL_ready ASPECT_PROJECTS were supposed to be about .
7372	1728	But then WHY did obummer ask , within month , for ASPECT_ANOTHER_50 BILLION ASPECT_STIMULUS expressly for ASPECT_INFRASTRUCTURE_REPAIRS ?
7373	1728	And 30 ASPECT_BILLION for teachers , and 26 ASPECT_BILLION for unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS to extend to 123 ASPECT_WEEKS !
7374	1728	Add amount in on cost of jobs and AMOUNT becomes much more than 210,400.00 per job .
7375	1729	As matter of fact , I do .
7376	1729	Would you prefer government had used money instead to directly hire people ?
7377	1729	Or perhaps ASPECT_DIRECT_SUBSIDY to everyone ?
7378	1729	Oh wait , would n't be gasp ASPECT_SOCIALISM ?
7379	1729	Of course efficient ASPECT_STIMULUS would be preferable , but unless you have suggestion on how to actually do , I really do n't see your ASPECT_POINT .
7380	1729	stimulus was obviously far from perfect , and constructive ASPECT_CRITICISM is always welcome .
7381	1729	But it was necessary , and suggesting that we should n't have done STIMULUS is unreasonable , unless you seriously are saying that depression with 25 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT would be preferable to ASPECT_CURRENT_SITUATION .
7382	1729	Sources please ?
7383	1729	's quite ASPECT_CLAIM you 're making , I 'd like to see to substantiate STIMULUS .
7384	1729	Even if STIMULUS true , STIMULUS rather beside point .
7385	1729	NO ASPECT_LEVEES are simply symptom of larger ASPECT_PROBLEM .
7386	1729	Arguing that if LA is corrupt and therefore does not spend ASPECT_LA_INFRASTRUCTURE_MONEY effectively we should not be spending money on infrastructure is rather akin to arguing that if Chicago ASPECT_FIRE_DEPARTMENT is corrupt and ineffective , WE should stop spending money on ASPECT_FIRE_protection ASPECT_PERIOD .
7387	1729	Well , for one , because because ASPECT_AMERICAN_SOCIETY of ASPECT_CIVIL_ENGINEERS estimates that 1.6 ASPECT_TRILLION is needed over ASPECT_FIVE-YEAR_PERIOD to bring nation infrastructure to good ASPECT_CONDITION .
7388	1729	http:\/\/apps.asce.org\/reportcard\/2005\/index.cfmLike I said , US has been neglecting I infrastructure for four ASPECT_DECADES .
7389	1729	portion of ASPECT_WE_CURRENT_INFRASTRUCTURE , especially ASPECT_INTERSTATE_SYSTEM , was built in 50 and 60 , with ASPECT_DESIGN_LIFE of around 50 ASPECT_YEARS .
7390	1729	You do math .
7391	1729	ASPECT_STIMULUS_SPENDING , even with another 50 ASPECT_BILLION added on , is just ASPECT_DROP in bucket of what WE really need .
7392	1729	unpleasant ASPECT_REALITY , but unless you think that you not having to pay taxes is more important then little ASPECT_THINGS like functional ASPECT_TRANSPORTATION , water , electricity , and ASPECT_SEWAGE_SYSTEMS ... Yes , spending money on teachers is obviously ASPECT_MASSIVE_WASTE !
7393	1729	Who needs schools ?
7394	1729	education ASPECT_WE_KIDS will get on streets should be more then enough to keep ASPECT_US_COMPETITIVE for decades to come , right ?
7395	1729	And unemployment ?
7396	1729	Ha , if 's out of work , WORK obviously AND fault , and WE should let AND lazy ASPECT_ASSES starve !
7399	1729	WE need to deal with situation as SITUATION really is , and ignoring ASPECT_PROBLEMS because you think AND should n't exist is both irresponsible and ASPECT_IRRATIONAL .
7400	1729	Oh , and incidentally - considering ASPECT_TEA_PARTY backed candidates have been winning and losing in ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRIMARIES , and considering ASPECT_PARTY_PRIMARIES are notoriously more partisan and farther from center then nation as whole , I really think that claiming ASPECT_TEA_PARTY represents overwhelming ASPECT_MAJORITY of nation is bit of overstatement .
7401	1730	I 'd prefer Govt stay out of `` FREE ASPECT_MARKET .
7402	1730	There is not one ASPECT_SHRED of PROOF that your ASPECT_STATEMENT is true .
7403	1730	Is SHRED one ASPECT_POSSIBILITY ?
7404	1730	Yes , SHRED is ONE of possibilities .
7405	1730	Just as economy is living , also could have recovered on .
7406	1730	is not saying would have , just saying is also ASPECT_ONE of possibilities .
7407	1730	814,000,000,000.00 that we did not and do not have .
7408	1730	cent of could have gone to ASPECT_TAX_RELIEF .
7409	1730	ASPECT_IMMEDIATE_814 ASPECT_BILLION in hands of people might have really STIMULATED economy .
7410	1730	is NOT alternative ASPECT_SUGGESTION .
7411	1730	just ASPECT_ONE of possibilities .
7412	1730	ASPECT_GOVT_INTERFERING in business was major ASPECT_FACTOR in ASPECT_DOWN_ECONOMY .
7413	1730	Relying on people to fix problem ASPECT_PEOPLE caused is hardly wisest ASPECT_MOVE .
7414	1730	And before you start with Bush blaming , I mean politicians of both ASPECT_PARTIES over decades of inexperienced and enlightened ASPECT_INTERFERENCE in business .
7415	1730	What politicians did over time was to change ASPECT_BUSINESS_HEADS_FROM can do leaders and fierce ASPECT_COMPETITORS , into ASPECT_BUSINESS_POLITICIANS in order to get along with Govt .
7416	1730	And like politicians everywhere , ASPECT_BUSINESS_POLITICIANS went bad same as elected ASPECT_POLITICIANS do .
7417	1730	If you want to substantiate TIME , do ASPECT_TINY_BIT of research on your and then you 'll know .
7418	1730	What you are UNaware of is not I problem .
7419	1730	And if I wish to say , I SAY UNAWARE .
7420	1730	And nowhere did I say that levees should not be funded .
7421	1730	Saying money got eaten up by corruption , which MONEY did , is not saying work should n't be done .
7422	1730	ASPECT_FEDERAL_HIGHWAYS_and ASPECT_BRIDGES , and ASPECT_INTERSTATE_HIGHWAYS_and ASPECT_BRIDGES , are responsibilities of ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVT .
7423	1730	All infrastructure is responsibility of state where ASPECT_ROAD_or ASPECT_BRIDGE is located .
7424	1730	Paying ASPECT_TEACHERS is also responsibility of state in question .
7425	1730	Dealing with reality was what I was telling you in regard to ASPECT_NO_LEVEES .
7426	1730	Living in unreal ASPECT_DREAMWORLD is what is irresponsible and irrational .
7427	1730	And looking to `` Big Brother ASPECT_GOVT for answers is irresponsible and irrational .
7428	1730	We will see , wo n't WE ?
7429	1730	And GOVT is ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , not ASPECT_TEA_PARTY .
7430	1730	GOVT is ASPECT_DIVERSE_GROUPS , not ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY .
7431	1730	And GOVT is majority of America as WE will see .
7432	1731	Sadly , Dan40 , not ASPECT_SOLUTION produced by free ASPECT_MARKET is ideal .
7433	1731	For example , DAN40 gave us cities with burning ASPECT_RIVERS , sucg as ASPECT_CUYAHOGA_RIVER in Cleveland , Ohio , which caught fire at least 13 ASPECT_TIMES .
7434	1731	DAN40 also gave US cars were frankly rolling death ASPECT_TRAPS .
7435	1731	ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT had to drag auto ASPECT_INDUSTRY kicking and screaming into even putting in ASPECT_SEAT_BELTS .
7436	1731	And then there were continent ASPECT_SPANNING_MONOPOLIES used ruthless ASPECT_BUSINESS_PRACTICES to crush potential ASPECT_COMPETITION , such as ASPECT_STANDARD_OIL .
7437	1731	Child ASPECT_LABOR , downright deadly working ASPECT_CONDITIONS_, ASPECT_SLUMS_and ASPECT_POVERTY , US could go on for quite ASPECT_WHILE .
7438	1731	point is that free ASPECT_MARKET is very powerful and efficient ASPECT_ENGINE for creating ASPECT_MATERIAL_WEALTH , but 's POINT does .
7439	1731	Both government and market are tools for creating prosperous ASPECT_SOCIETY and dealing with society problems .
7440	1731	Like tools , has ASPECT_STRENGTHS_and ASPECT_WEAKNESSES , and when used appropriately compliment .
7441	1731	ASPECT_HISTORICAL_EXPERIENCE has shown that neither pure ASPECT_LAISSEZ-FAIRE_CAPITALISM nor strict ASPECT_COMMAND_ECONOMY_WORK particularly well in world .
7442	1731	We need system of ASPECT_CHECKS_and ASPECT_BALANCES , where different ASPECT_INSTITUTIONS work toward strengths , and keep eye on .
7443	1731	US 've been doing US best to ASPECT_RESEARCH_and ASPECT_REFERENCE US posts , if there 's US need to further ASPECT_SUBSTANTIATE , US apologize and ask that you please specify exactly which ASPECT_STATEMENT you mean .
7444	1731	is US ASPECT_BASIC_ARGUMENT :1 - Around time of 2008 , ASPECT_US_ECONOMY was on verge of major ASPECT_COLLAPSE , and faced very ASPECT_POSSIBILITY of second Great Depression ASPECT_.2 - Since then , economy has moved back from brink and improved substantially , even though ASPECT_CURRENT_ECONOMIC_SITUATION is still far from good ASPECT_.3 - Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION created 25 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , thousands of ASPECT_BANK_FAILURES , and ASPECT_EXTENSIVE_HOMELESSNESS in US .
7445	1731	US did n't think of was in dispute .
7446	1731	If you take issue with , please say so and US will track down sources for you .4 - ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL has had ASPECT_SUBSTANTIAL_IMPACT on economy , stimulating both ASPECT_GDP_and ASPECT_EMPLOYMENT .
7447	1731	US have already provided ASPECT_EXTENSIVE_SUBSTANTIATION for statement - if you need your ASPECT_MEMORY_REFRESHED , then just scroll up to US ASPECT_PREVIOUS_POSTS .
7448	1731	If you still disagree with US on point , then you either need to challenge US sources , provide sources of your to contradict US position , or challenge aspect of US reasoning .
7449	1731	Simply saying that there 's no `` ASPECT_PROOF is not argument - there 's no as absolute ASPECT_PROOF of anything , simply evidence in support of or against position .
7450	1731	US 've provided evidence in support of ASPECT_US_POSITION - RESPONSIBILITY 's now your ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY to provide evidence in support of ASPECT_YOURS_.5 - conclusion to be drawn is that we were in serious ASPECT_DANGER of seeing 25 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , and that stimulus helped avert .
7451	1731	Therefore , saying that stimulus should not have been passed is implying that you find running serious ASPECT_RISK of 25 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT to be preferable to ASPECT_CURRENT_SITUATION with 10 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT .
7452	1731	is simple and ASPECT_BASIC_LOGIC .
7453	1731	If you find fault with , where , exactly ?
7454	1731	US have never stated that 25 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT was certain .
7455	1731	But future never is certain .
7456	1731	So again US ask , do you think risking drastic ASPECT_COLLAPSE and ASPECT_MASSIVE_human ASPECT_SUFFERING is preferable to what we have ?
7457	1731	If you 're saying that pure ASPECT_TAX_CUTS are much more effective at stimulating economy then anything , then , you know , actually make argument for .
7458	1731	economist say that ASPECT_TAX_CUTS are one of ASPECT_SEVERAL_effective ASPECT_WAYS of stimulating economy .
7459	1731	For example , in ASPECT_INDUSTRY_SURVEY of economists US cited above , `` Panelists were asked to consider nine of elements of ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGE and rank US effectiveness .
7460	1731	three ranked as effective were ASPECT_INFRASTRUCTURE of ASPECT_PHYSICAL_NATURE -LRB- roads , ASPECT_BRIDGES_, etc ASPECT_-RRB- , unemployment benefits ASPECT_EXPANSION , and ASPECT_PERSONAL_TAX-RATE_CUTS .
7461	1731	`` http:\/\/www.nabe.com\/graphweek\/2009\/gw090329.htmlAs ASPECT_FINAL_NOTE , US would point out when speaking of ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL as NOTE was passed , you tend to say things such as `` 814,000,000,000.00 that YOU did not and do not have .
7462	1731	And yet you seemed to imply that you would have supported expenditure if EXPENDITURE had gone to ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
7463	1731	Perhaps US am misunderstanding you , but EXPENDITURE sounds very ASPECT_AS if you 're implying that spending money is fine , so long as you get big ASPECT_PIECE of EXPENDITURE .
7464	1731	On what basis do you assert that ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INTERFERENCE led to recession ?
7465	1731	US 've heard lots of theories about causes , although people seem to agree that collapse of ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE and failure to regulate ASPECT_DERIVATIVES_MARKET are major ASPECT_FACTORS .
7466	1731	What ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INTERFERENCE are you talking about ?
7467	1731	How exactly did COLLAPSE cause recession ?
7468	1731	Explain , please .
7469	1731	Saying that politics has somehow infected business in decades is frankly absurd - ASPECT_BUSINESS_and ASPECT_POLITICS have gone arm in arm for time immemorial .
7470	1731	Eve back in ASPECT_ROMAN_REPUBLIC_CAMPAIGNS ran on money as much as modern ASPECT_ONES do .
7471	1731	Err , if you want to make statement , then RESPONSIBILITY your ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY to back RESPONSIBILITY up , not ASPECT_MINE .
7472	1731	US 'm very curious where you got `` Less then ASPECT_10 of money reaching ASPECT_LEVEES_FIGURE .
7473	1731	If US need help doing research , ASPECT_PM_US and US 'll be happy to teach you .
7474	1731	And US have to tell you , refusing to back up your ASPECT_STATEMENTS makes ASPECT_HELP_SOUND like you 're just making HELP up .
7475	1731	Soooooo , SOOOOOO terrible for ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT to do , but if ASPECT_STATE_GOVERNMENTS do , perfectly okay ?
7476	1731	O_o US 'm sorry , but US really do n't follow your ASPECT_REASONING there .
7477	1731	What ASPECT_DIFFERENCE does O_O make if O_O feds or states ?
7478	1731	Ultimately O_O being paid for by ASPECT_TAX_DOLLARS anyway .
7479	1731	ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT has greater financial ASPECT_RESOURCES then of states , and of states are legally or constitutionally unable to borrow money , even in emergency .
7480	1731	GOVERNMENT only makes sense for level of government with deepest ASPECT_POCKETS to do ASPECT_HEAVY_LIFTING during hard ASPECT_TIMES .
7481	1731	If you have plan for fighting corruption and inefficiency , please , ASPECT_SHARE !
7482	1731	We need good ASPECT_IDEAS_WE can get on subject .
7483	1731	And US 'm simply pointing out SUBJECT at least ASPECT_SOUNDS as if your ASPECT_GENERAL_SOLUTION to problems is to ignore them .
7484	1731	If you have constructive ASPECT_SOLUTIONS to offer , US 'd very much like to hear about THEM .
7485	1731	As for `` Big ASPECT_BROTHER ... Have you actually read 1984 ?
7486	1731	US really do n't see how there 's comparison between government builds roads and ASPECT_BRIDGES , pays teachers , and provides unemployment ASPECT_INSURANCE and government has ASPECT_VIDEO_SURVEILLANCE in citizen home , requires everyone to participate in `` Daily ASPECT_HATE , and uses ASPECT_PHYSICAL_and psychological ASPECT_TORTURE to brainwash dissenters into believing that government is literally omnipotent .
7487	1732	You seem to love to credit or blame me for saying things ME did not say .
7488	1732	Your liberal ASPECT_PREJUDICE prevents you from reading what was written , rather you decide what you think ME said .
7489	1732	Which makes PREJUDICE ASPECT_IMPOSSIBLE for ME to carry on intelligent ASPECT_DEBATE with you when ME say things clearly and you decide ME 'm saying other than .
7490	1732	So enjoy your liberal nonsense ASPECT_DREAMLAND .
7491	1732	If you ever bump into reality , come back and talk to ME .
7492	1732	ME can not defend what you wish ME said since ME did not say what you wish ME said .
7493	1732	And you list litany of bad ASPECT_THINGS free ASPECT_MARKET has done , but you list none of good ASPECT_THINGS LITANY has done .
7494	1732	And ASPECT_SEAT_BELTS were not mandated by Govt until cars already had them .
7495	1732	WEARING ASPECT_SEAT_BELTS was mandated , not installing THEM .
7496	1732	Same with ASPECT_PADDED_DASHES , and collapsible ASPECT_STEERING_WHEELS and crush ASPECT_ZONES .
7497	1732	installed in cars by AUTO ASPECT_MEN while politicians were chasing hookers on ASPECT_EUROPEAN_JUNKETS .
7498	1732	When auto ASPECT_MEN got replaced by ASPECT_POLITICAL_savvy ASPECT_EXECUTIVES , safety was mandated in cars , and ASPECT_AMERICAN_auto ASPECT_INDUSTRY went down toilet .
7499	1732	ASPECT_GAS_GUZZLERS were order of day , WHY ?
7500	1732	Because ORDER was what ASPECT_SOLD !
7501	1732	Then until economy went to hell it was yuppie SUV 's that sold .
7502	1732	Amazing how ASPECT_TREE_HUGGERS can ignore HUGGERS driving about in 4 ASPECT_TON_SUBURBAN_Assault ASPECT_VEHICLE and blame others for damaging Ma ASPECT_NATURE .
7503	1732	free ASPECT_MARKET has done bad , no two ASPECT_WAYS about .
7504	1732	But MARKET also INVENTED ` ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS , ' free ASPECT_MARKET came up with 40 ASPECT_HOUR_WEEK , ASPECT_NOT_UNIONS .
7505	1732	Did you know ?
7506	1732	And 8 ASPECT_HOUR_DAY , also not ASPECT_UNION_IDEA .
7507	1732	Would you care to compare bad ASPECT_THINGS Govt has done , with bad free ASPECT_MARKET has done .
7508	1732	Or do YOU live on street called ONE ASPECT_WAY ?
7509	1732	Govt IS and has been , , bigger ASPECT_PROBLEM -LRB- with no good ASPECT_ANSWERS -RRB- compared to free ASPECT_MARKET .
7510	1732	And you list 1 2 3 4 ASPECT_5 like they were facts .
7511	1732	THEY are ASPECT_NOT_FACTS , THEY are liberal ASPECT_OPINIONS .
7512	1732	Look up difference .
7513	1732	But you will read like ME said THEY are wrong .
7514	1732	THEY are opinions , neither right or wrong , but not ASPECT_FACTS .
7515	1734	Yes , I will vote in 2012 , but not for I party I have been with since 18 ASPECT_YEARS old !
7516	1734	sinister has taken over I party and I know !
7517	1734	I will not be part of destruction of America I know and love , I love country and will be true too ASPECT_18 !
7518	1736	Your honest ASPECT_MAN , ASPECT_MAN_HOPE_SMART too ... Jollee
7519	1737	And I refuse to vote for Putin !
7520	1739	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- ASPECT_MOD_EDIT : Flamebaiting -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- You say ASPECT_STIMULUS_SPENDING SAVED economy .
7521	1739	is opinion , not fact .
7522	1739	When I say that economies have recovered on -LRB- .
7523	1739	IS fact .
7524	1739	But OPINION is not saying that ASPECT_PRESENT_ECONOMY would have recovered on ECONOMY .
7525	1739	We DO NOT know either ASPECT_WAY , is fact .
7526	1739	I OPINION , and always stated as , is that Stimulus was and is waste of money .
7527	1739	When I said IF 3.5 million ASPECT_JOBS were created , -LRB- and I opinion is that they were not and will not be -RRB- then jobs cost 232,000.00 .
7528	1739	ME believe ASPECT_MILLION_OK for Govt to `` create jobs at cost of 232,000.00 , and also OK for Govt to increase taxes on who are `` rich .
7529	1739	Meaning make over ASPECT_200,000.00 .
7530	1739	So ASPECT_MILLION_OK for Govt to ` create ' jobs cost 32,000.00 MORE than `` rich ASPECT_LINE ?
7531	1739	`` When ME said Govt could just as well given whole ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY to unemployed , ASPECT_ME clearly said is NOT alternative ASPECT_SUGGESTION .
7532	1739	Yet your prejudicial ASPECT_INTERPRETATION blinded YOUR to and attempted to ridicule ME for making suggestion .
7533	1739	Which ASPECT_ME did not make .
7534	1739	So since SO are unable to see or hear , or read , REALITY , and ME am unable to wander in ASPECT_YOUR_UTOPIAN_DREAMWORLD because reality keeps biting ME on ass , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ASPECT_, , Forget UNABLE .
7535	1741	Given fact economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 ASPECT_JOBS month when stimulus was passed and ASPECT_STIMULUS_now ASPECT_GROWING and ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR is creating jobs , given that ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_CBO estimates that millions of jobs have been saved or created by stimulus , it is opinion is well supported by fact .
7536	1742	You statement is ALSO opinion .
7537	1742	And CBO is ASPECT_NOT_BI-PARTISAN , unless you consider CBO speaking FOR party in power to be bi-partisan .
7538	1742	And CBO was correct last , , , , , , , , , , , , , , WHEN ??
7539	1742	They make 10 ASPECT_YEAR_PROJECTIONS .
7540	1742	Kindly name ASPECT_CBO_PROJECTION of 10 or ASPECT_YEARS_VINTAGE is correct .
7541	1743	Supported by facts .
7542	1743	Sure it is .
7543	1743	IT 's not controlled by party in power You confuse projections versus reporting ASPECT_PAST_EVENTS .
7544	1744	passes for originality in liberal ASPECT_WORLD .
7545	1745	Just about as as post to which it responded .
7546	1746	NET : you can not name accurate ASPECT_PROJECTION of CBO .
7547	1746	You may use ASPECT_CBO_PROJECTIONS since ASPECT_NET_INCEPTION .
7548	1746	Is there ASPECT_SINGLE_ONE proved accurate ?
7549	1746	And since there IS NOT , why should citizen pay attention to ASPECT_CBO_PROJECTIONS .
7550	1746	We know one about projections from experience , THING WILL BE WRONG .
7551	1746	party in ASPECT_POWER_GIVES CBO parameters want CBO to consider .
7552	1746	CBO simply projects on what CBO is given .
7553	1746	party in power gives CBO program that ASPECT_PARTY_ESTIMATES will cost trillion over 10 ASPECT_YEARS .
7554	1746	tell CBO that will raise taxes in 8 ASPECT_YEARS to get needed ASPECT_TRILLION in funding .
7555	1746	ASPECT_CBO_` ASPECT_PROJECTS ' program to be deficit ASPECT_NEUTRAL .
7556	1746	You know , I know , CBO knows , dust ASPECT_MITES in Congressional ASPECT_CARPET know , that no ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE will be passed .
7557	1746	But is not CBO job , parameters say program will be funded so ASPECT_CBO_PROJECTS_deficit ASPECT_NEUTRAL .
7558	1746	silly ASPECT_SLEIGHT of hand by whichever ASPECT_PARTY is in power .
7559	1747	No ASPECT_ONE is talking about projections .
7560	1747	Why are you ?
7561	1747	Proof that ASPECT_CBO_ESTIMATES of ASPECT_JOB_CREATION are based on parameters given to CBO by Democrats , please .
7562	1749	Talk about seeing world through rose colored ASPECT_GLASSES .
7563	1749	Once again you present OPINIONS AS FACTS .
7564	1749	FACT -LRB- ASPECT_KT_-RRB- ASPECT_N1 .
7565	1749	truth ASPECT_VERIFIABLE from ASPECT_EXPERIENCE_or ASPECT_OBSERVATION.O-PIN-ION -LRB- - pnyn -RRB- ASPECT_N._1 .
7566	1749	belief or conclusion held with confidence but not substantiated by positive knowledge or ASPECT_PROOF : ASPECT_NY_times ASPECT_LINK is useless , they are ASPECT_ADVERTISING_AGENCY for liberals AND THEY are rapidly going out of business for THEY stupid ASPECT_CHOICE of yellow ASPECT_JOURNALISM .
7567	1749	ASPECT_NABE_LINK is clearly opinion , no ASPECT_FACTS in evidence .
7568	1749	But amazingly , ASPECT_THEY_OPINION is that there is 10.3 CHANCE that Stimulus shortened recession .
7569	1749	60.3 CHANCE that Stimulus had `` modest ASPECT_EFFECT on shortening recession .
7570	1749	And 29.4 CHANCE that Stimulus had little ASPECT_OR NO ASPECT_EFFECT .
7571	1749	Are you sure 's info you wish to use to justify expenditure of nearly trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS that we do n't have ?
7572	1749	hint : CHANCE does not translate into FACT .
7573	1749	And link to ASPECT_BEN_STEIN opinion .
7574	1749	Did you even read LINK ?
7575	1749	STEIN wrote that 3\/19\/10 .
7576	1749	Does not voice strong ASPECT_SUPPORT for Stimulus then , nor strong ASPECT_OPPOSITION to 3\/19\/10 ASPECT_EITHER .
7577	1749	In case , again , FACT is opinion not ASPECT_FACT .
7578	1749	fact is that economy is in almost exactly ASPECT_PLACE_TODAY as ECONOMY was on 3\/19\/10 .
7579	1749	7 ASPECT_MONTHS later and improvements to economy are infinitesimally small .
7580	1749	And just as good ASPECT_CASE can be made for Stimulus slowing recovery as can be made for speeding CASE up .
7581	1749	As can case be made for ASPECT_NATURAL_RECOVERY taking place on CASE .
7582	1749	As ASPECT_YOUR_LINKS bear out !
7583	1749	Obummer could n't look up respect on Google let alone deserve !
7584	1749	I 'll elaborate if you 're confused about I opinion .
7585	1749	OBUMMER IS closed ASPECT_MINDED_SOCIALIST completely lost in academic ASPECT_THEORIES with no ASPECT_CLUE of practicality .
7586	1749	But is ASPECT_OBUMMER_considered and very experienced ASPECT_OPINION .
7587	1750	Yeeeees , Dan , LEHMAN am well aware of difference between ASPECT_OPINIONS_and ASPECT_FACTS .
7588	1750	LEHMAN also know that facts always come with degree of doubt and ASPECT_UNCERTAINTY .
7589	1750	And opinions are n't created ASPECT_EQUAL , and do n't exist in vacuum .
7590	1750	There are no ASPECT_CERTAINTIES in life , no ASPECT_ABSOLUTES .
7591	1750	We need to weigh evidence in ASPECT_PARTICULAR_CASE and decide what best ASPECT_CONCLUSION is based on information available to WE .
7592	1750	LEHMAN present evidence as LEHMAN find PRESENT , and invite everyone to reach THERE ASPECT_CONCLUSIONS and present THERE ASPECT_ARGUMENTS .
7593	1750	LEHMAN do n't change evidence to suit ASPECT_LEHMAN_POINT of view , and LEHMAN do n't cherry pick .
7594	1750	ASPECT_LEHMAN_CHANGE_LEHMAN_POINT of view to suit evidence .
7595	1750	If you want to convince LEHMAN , then show LEHMAN .
7596	1750	ASPECT_SHOW_LEHMAN facts , show LEHMAN your ASPECT_ARGUMENT .
7597	1750	LEHMAN 'm getting little ASPECT_TIRED of people who say that ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE that ever presents anything ASPECT_THEN disagree with is mouthpiece for side .
7598	1750	And yes , there are plenty of liberals guilty of as ASPECT_WELL .
7599	1750	ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE does n't challenge you and make you question your ASPECT_POSITIONS at least from time to time is n't very good ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE .
7600	1750	In case , in instance , ASPECT_NY_TIMES is simply reporting on research done by Moody ASPECT_ET_AL. .
7601	1750	If you want to discount information , ORIGINATOR originator , not reporter , you need to address .
7602	1750	As for ASPECT_NABE_SURVEY , yes you 're right , SURVEY is matter of opinion .
7603	1750	opinions of of ASPECT_PROFESSIONAL_ECONOMISTS , who study stuff for living .
7604	1750	And yes , LEHMAN did read ASPECT_BEN_STEIN article .
7605	1750	As LEHMAN stated when LEHMAN originally posted link , point is not that ASPECT_MR_STEIN is giving enthusiastic ASPECT_ENDORSEMENT of stimulus - clearly STEIN is not - point is that very conservative ASPECT_ECONOMIST of ASPECT_HIGH_STANDING like ASPECT_MR_STEIN , who has criticized stimulus on occasions , would seem to imply that stimulus was both ASPECT_NECESSARY and at least ASPECT_EFFECTIVE .
7606	1750	`` But losses to economy following failure of Lehman have been on order of hundreds of billions , maybe trillions .
7607	1750	Certainly rescue and ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGES needed in wake of ASPECT_LEHMAN_FAILURE have amounted to trillions .
7608	1750	`` And if just as good ASPECT_CASE can be made that stimulus slowed down recovery , then make STIMULUS already .
7609	1750	LEHMAN must admit that LEHMAN am rather puzzled by your ASPECT_INSISTENCE that stimulus has hurt economy in face of evidence to contrary .
7610	1750	If YOUR have evidence supports ASPECT_YOUR_POSITION , why have n't LEHMAN shown us ?
7611	1750	And if YOUR do n't , why do YOUR hold so steadfastly to EVIDENCE ?
7612	1750	And as LEHMAN pointed out before , 37 of ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL was ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS .
7613	1750	If BILL did n't help economy , implies that ASPECT_TAX_CUTS do n't help economy .
7614	1751	If you wish , you may add additional 10,000 ASPECT_WORDS , or million ASPECT_WORDS .
7615	1751	But opinion will still be opinion .
7616	1751	You said 37 of Stimulus was ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS .
7617	1751	I have opinion on .
7618	1751	ASPECT_FULL_AMOUNT of Stimulus is now admitted to be 814 ASPECT_BILLION .
7619	1751	37 of is 301,180,000,000.00 .
7620	1751	I opinion is that you should recheck your ASPECT_CLAIM .
7621	1752	There I fixed it for you .
7622	1753	Calling my ASPECT_POSITION opinion -LRB- which ASPECT_POSITION is -RRB- does not make POSITION less well founded ASPECT_OR grounded in facts .
7623	1753	You seem to think that if you call opinion , means OPINION arbitrary , and you can just as legitimately take position on matter .
7624	1753	may be true if you 're debating whether chili or ASPECT_STIR_FRY is tastier .
7625	1753	OPINION 's not if you 're debating if Earth is flat or round .
7626	1753	And OPINION 's not when we 're debating whether or not ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL helped economy .
7627	1753	Stop trying to hide behind flimsy rhetorical ASPECT_DEVICES , and either ASPECT_SHOW WE your ASPECT_EVIDENCE or admit you do n't have .
7628	1753	As for numbers ... -LRB- shrug -RRB- ASPECT_NOMINAL_COSTS and revenues related to legislation is \*\* always \*\* estimate .
7629	1753	numbers ca n't be determined until well after legislation has run ASPECT_LEGISLATION_COURSE - for bill .
7630	1753	And there will always be differences between estimate and , 's why ESTIMATE called estimate .
7631	1753	Your ASPECT_POINT being ?
7632	1754	is your ASPECT_QUOTE : `` And as pointed out before , 37 of ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL was ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS .
7633	1754	If QUOTE did n't help economy , implies that ASPECT_TAX_CUTS do n't help economy .
7634	1754	`` Now eyes are not what YOUR once were , but do not see ASPECT_WORD_ESTIMATE anywhere .
7635	1754	But if you wish to retract and now call NOW estimate , OK .
7636	1754	And will say 301 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS is wildly insane ASPECT_ESTIMATE .
7637	1754	Now can statement be opinion and also be true ?
7638	1754	Yes of course opinion can prove true .
7639	1754	ASPECT_EQUALLY_TRUE for both ASPECT_OPINIONS and YOU .
7640	1756	ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , formally known as ASPECT_AMERICAN_Recovery and ASPECT_REINVESTMENT_ACT , is meant to create jobs and boost economy .
7641	1756	BILL cost 787 ASPECT_BILLION , including 499 ASPECT_BILLION to fund ASPECT_NEW_ROADS , hire teachers and generally keep people employed , and about 288 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS to ASPECT_INDIVIDUALS_and ASPECT_BUSINESSES .
7642	1756	http:\/\/www.politifact.com\/truth-o-me...hird-tax-cuts\/288\/787 = 37 .
7643	1756	ASPECT_TAX_CUTS were 37 of ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL .
7644	1756	BILL lower if you count additional ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONIES added since then .
7645	1758	No ASPECT_WAY !
7646	1758	like asking me if ME want America too fail !
7647	1759	Obama also needs another ASPECT_NOBEL_Peace ASPECT_PRIZE .
7648	1760	Obama did not deserve one ... .
7650	1761	I know .
7651	1761	Just being sarcastic .
7652	1763	Do you people just drink Kool-ade your ASPECT_BRAINWASHERS feed you .
7653	1763	Do you not independently try to find out TRUTH for yourselves ?
7654	1763	Why do I listen to both FOX and ASPECT_MSNBC ?
7655	1763	Because I want to hear both ASPECT_SIDES and decide who is lying MORE .
7656	1763	Here are sources for you to peruse .
7657	1763	NONE of HERE right leaning or ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_CONNECTED : ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WASHINGTONINDEPENDENT.COM\/WP-...10\/08\/CFRB.PNGFROM_BLOOMBERG : ASPECT_AUG._20 -LRB- ASPECT_BLOOMBERG_-RRB- -- Congressional Budget ASPECT_OFFICE lowered ASPECT_AUG._ESTIMATE for cost of ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION &#8217; s ASPECT_ECONOMIC_STIMULUS_PACKAGE to 814 ASPECT_BILLION from 862 ASPECT_BILLION .
7658	1763	CBO adjusted estimate because ESTIMATE &#8220; revised ASPECT_ESTIMATE_ECONOMIC_and ASPECT_TECHNICAL_ASSUMPTIONS , &#8221; agency said in ASPECT_REPORT_ISSUED yesterday .
7659	1763	from ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST , definite liberal ASPECT_PUBLICATION : CBO cautioned that act effects are expected to `` gradually diminish during second ASPECT_HALF of 2010 and beyond , leaving ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR to pick up slack in economy is already showing signs of deteriorating rapidly .
7660	1763	On bright ASPECT_SIDE , -LRB- now FUNNY -RRB- CBO revised cost of package downward : Originally estimated to cost 787 ASPECT_BILLION over 10 ASPECT_YEARS , stimulus was later estimated to cost 862 ASPECT_BILLION .
7661	1763	But in report released Tuesday , CBO said REPORT now expects measure to cost about 814 ASPECT_BILLION through 2019 , with 70 ASPECT_PERCENT of costs incurred by end of year .
7662	1763	from ASPECT_CBO_REPORT : You will find CBO `` ASPECT_S_revised ASPECT_ESTIMATE of ASPECT_ARRA_ACT `` ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL on ASPECT_PAGE_9 .
7663	1763	They estimate bill to cost 787 ASPECT_BILLION at passage , revised cost upward to 862 ASPECT_BILLION months later and have now settled on lower ASPECT_ESTIMATE of 814 .
7665	1763	Do you want proof that you have no ASPECT_CLUE that your ASPECT_MASTERS are lying to you ?
7666	1763	I could , if I wished , cite 20 to 50 ASPECT_NEUTRAL_SOURCES .
7667	1763	But you 'd be better off doing RESEARCH , and learning on your .
7668	1763	Your ASPECT_MISCONCEPTIONS have become bore .
7669	1763	Would you please start learning what is really happening in country or STFU .
7670	1764	ASPECT_JOLLEE_PEOPLE OF USA are entity that you can trust , unfortunately !
7672	1766	WRONG again .
7673	1766	Misinterpreting opinion as fact .
7674	1766	OPINION says it is EXPECTED that effects will be diminishing over time .
7675	1766	ASSUMES there was effect , OPINION does not prove ANYTHING .
7676	1766	Is ASPECT_ENGLISH_NOT you ASPECT_NATIVE_LANGUAGE ?
7677	1766	report of CBO neither proves there was or proves there was not effect caused by stimulus .
7678	1766	Remember ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DOWNTURNS have happened throughout history .
7679	1766	had kind of ASPECT_GOVT_INTERVENTION , others had NO ASPECT_INTERVENTION whatsoever .
7680	1766	eventually recovered , NONE had ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL .
7681	1766	one with ASPECT_GOVT_INTERVENTION was Depression .
7682	1766	With ASPECT_MASSIVE_and unrelenting ASPECT_GOVT_INTERVENTION , depression lasted from ASPECT_EARLY_30 until END OF WWII .
7683	1766	help !
7684	1766	When Stimulus was passed , DAY , I predicted that recession just got extended by 2 ASPECT_YEARS_MINIMUM .
7685	1766	Now 21 ASPECT_MONTHS later , economy is still but ASPECT_FLAT .
7686	1766	Was I prediction correct ?
7687	1766	Not yet , but we 're getting there .
7688	1766	And when recession really does end , you may ABSOLUTELY count on unpleasant ASPECT_INFLATION .
7689	1767	-LRB- Looks amused -RRB- So you 're happy to quote CBO when you feel CBO supporting your ASPECT_POSITION , but when I point out CBO actually doing ASPECT_OPPOSITE_, ASPECT_CBO suddenly becomes opinion ?
7690	1767	Yes , yes , I know you 're just trying to turn I own liberal ASPECT_BRAINWASHING_PROPAGANDA against I , or .
7691	1767	-LRB- Incidentally , 's sarcasm , and not intended as serious ASPECT_REPRESENTATION of your ASPECT_POSITION .
7692	1767	And are ASPECT_SHOUTING_and ASPECT_PERSONAL_INSULTS really necessary ?
7693	1767	They really do n't strengthen your ASPECT_ARGUMENT at all , you know . -RRB-
7694	1767	And as I 've already explained , there 's no as absolute ASPECT_PROOF , and ASPECT_SINGLE_PIECE of evidence certainly does n't `` prove anything .
7695	1767	But when ASPECT_MULTIPLE_LINES of evidence point to , you can have pretty good ASPECT_AMOUNT of confidence in conclusion .
7696	1767	And so far evidence is pointing to ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL having helped economy .
7697	1767	And yes , you are right that economy will almost certainly completely recover on ECONOMY .
7698	1767	But I do n't think 's reason to not use tools at disposal to help situation .
7699	1767	ASPECT_HISTORICAL_CORRECTIONS : Obama ASPECT_STIMULUS_POLICY has been pretty much as used by Presidents of both ASPECT_PARTIES in recession since Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
7700	1767	details vary , but ASPECT_OVERALL_STRATEGY is - ASPECT_CUT_TAXES , extend unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS , ASPECT_INCREASE_SPENDING , do whatever 's necessary to get money flowing again .
7701	1767	Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION is generally considered to have lasted from 1929 until start of WWII , not end .
7702	1767	Depression hit DEPRESSION lowest ASPECT_POINT in 1933 , and after began slow but steady ASPECT_IMPROVEMENT .
7703	1767	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_CONDITIONS had improved lot by 1937 , when conservative ASPECT_COALITION convinced FDR that economy had improved enough that ECONOMY was time to return to normal ASPECT_POLICY .
7704	1767	ASPECT_NEW_DEAL_PROGRAMS were rolled back , taxes increased , and spending cut to try to balance ASPECT_FEDERAL_BUDGET .
7705	1767	result was second ASPECT_CRASH , where ASPECT_INDUSTRIAL_PRODUCTION fell almost ASPECT_30 in months , and unemployment went from 14.3 in 1937 to ASPECT_19.0 in 1938 .
7706	1767	And no , your ASPECT_PREDICTION has proven to be wrong .
7707	1767	Right now economy is stagnant , not in recession .
7708	1767	Things are n't good , but NO 're not getting worse .
7709	1767	True , makes little ASPECT_DIFFERENCE to folks who are out of work , but ASPECT_ECONOMY_BOOMING makes little ASPECT_DIFFERENCE to out of work .
7710	1767	Just to clarify , ASPECT_FLAT_= ASPECT_STAGNANT , going down = ASPECT_RECESSION , going up = ASPECT_RECOVERY .
7711	1767	To sum up , as bad as things are now , evidence indicates that without ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , things would be appreciably worse .
7712	1767	As for policies being advocated by Republicans ... As far as I can tell , FOLKS are saying FOLKS want to cut taxes and balance budget .
7713	1767	Setting aside for moment that in order to balance budget , you 'll realistically have to raise taxes and \* ASPECT_CUT_SPENDING , policies are awful ASPECT_LOT like ones Hoover followed at beginning of Depression , and that ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_COALITION convinced FDR to try in 1937 .
7714	1767	Balancing budget will be short ASPECT_TERM hit to economy - TERM always has been .
7715	1768	REALITY is strength my ASPECT_ARGUMENTS needs .
7716	1768	And at no ASPECT_TIME and in no ASPECT_WAY have MY attempted to use ASPECT_CBO_STATEMENTS as facts .
7717	1768	Making error is strictly your ASPECT_DOMAIN .
7718	1768	Whether MY agree with anything CBO says or not , does not in way assign factual ASPECT_CREDENCE to ASPECT_NOT_OPINIONS\/PROJECTIONS .
7719	1768	ASPECT_MY_ALWAYS know ASPECT_NOT_REPORTS are conjecture , not ASPECT_FACT .
7720	1768	When you agree with NOT , suddenly NOT are stating facts .
7721	1768	's silly .
7722	1768	Unemployment remains at 9.6 for September .
7723	1768	Essentially ASPECT_FLAT for of 2010 .
7724	1768	Talk about your phantom ` ASPECT_RECOVERY ' to people .
7725	1768	Read ASPECT_BLS_REPORT .
7726	1768	Especially part says that no longer counted as unemployed because UNEMPLOYED have stopped looking for job is now 503,000 higher than ASPECT_SEPTEMBER_2009 , WHEN ASPECT_FIGURE_WAS_697,000 .
7727	1768	ASPECT_PART_now ASPECT_1,200,000 .
7728	1768	Stimulus is serving well , is ASPECT_STIMULUS_NOT ?
7729	1768	Perhaps MY should point out that are statistics from Bureau of ASPECT_LABOR_STATISTICS and are supposed to be facts , not ASPECT_OPINIONS , since you seem to have great ASPECT_DIFFICULTY with distinctions .
7730	1769	Flat might not be much of recovery .
7731	1769	But RECESSION 's not recession either .
7732	1769	In fact RECESSION leaning more towards recovery than recession because we are growing .
7733	1769	WE 're just not growing at fast enough ASPECT_RATE .
7734	1770	And what ASPECT_PROOF do liberals have that very ASPECT_SLOW , almost ASPECT_NON-EXISTENT_`` ASPECT_RECOVERY in not caused by ASPECT_NATURAL_RECOVERY as HAS happened times in past .
7735	1770	Is RECOVERY ASPECT_STIMULUS_OR is RECOVERY ASPECT_WOUNDS healing on LIBERALS own ?
7736	1770	Neither you nor I can PROVE either premise to be true or false .
7737	1770	oBum is first to point out , `` FIRST 'S ASPECT_NOT_MY_FAULT .
7738	1770	No ASPECT_MATTER what question .
7739	1770	So maybe recovery , what little there is of RECOVERY , is not YOU `` fault , either .
7740	1771	No ASPECT_PROOF is needed .
7741	1771	BASIC basic understanding ASPECT_STIMULUS_SPENDING increases consumer ASPECT_DEMAND and thus results in shorter ASPECT_RECESSION .
7742	1771	Yes economy theoretically could have recovered on ECONOMY .
7743	1771	But there is no ASPECT_WAY that after financial ASPECT_COLLAPSE and collapse of 3 largest ASPECT_JOB produces , auto ASPECT_COMPANIES , we would have been out of recession less than 2 ASPECT_YEARS after YEARS started .
7744	1771	It is just economically impossible for recession to end in less than 2 ASPECT_YEARS without ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE .
7745	1771	In no ASPECT_PREVIOUS_EXAMPLE where WE 've had complete financial ASPECT_FAILURE and major ASPECT_INDUSTRY_FAILURE at time and FAILURE has recovered on EXAMPLE in less than 2 ASPECT_YEARS .
7746	1771	just does n't happen .
7747	1771	EXAMPLE 's not possible to do .
7748	1771	ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INTERVENTION ended recession faster and thus saved ASPECT_WE_MONEY .
7749	1771	I do n't know why you are so against saving money .
7750	1772	And fires will go out on also .
7751	1772	But we usually think best ASPECT_DOUSE THEIR with water to reduce ASPECT_OVERALL_DAMAGE .
7752	1772	I predicted 2 ASPECT_YEARS ago if Economy recovered , Conservatives would say ECONOMY would have done so ASPECT_FASTER without stimulas .
7753	1772	If ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION had n't pushed ASPECT_STIMULAS_PLAN and economy was 4 times ASPECT_WORSE than ECONOMY is now , of CONSERVATIVES still with jobs would be blaming his ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION .
7754	1772	I do know that 2 ASPECT_YEARS ago , I 401k was half ASPECT_SIZE AGO is now , people were wondering whether GM would survive year , whether ASPECT_BANKING_INDUSTRY would go under , and how far ASPECT_HOUSING_PRICES would tumble .
7755	1772	There was panic in air .
7756	1772	Now there is no ASPECT_PANIC .
7757	1772	ASPECT_BANKING_INDUSTRY is stable , GM is working , ASPECT_HOUSING_PRICES have largely stabilized and industry is picking up - slowly .
7760	1772	But recession was years in making , and ASPECT_YEARS_RECOVERY will not happen overnight .
7761	1773	So we should have squirted water on economy ?
7762	1773	Or throw money at ASPECT_FOREST_FIRES ?
7763	1773	Or can WE make arguments are not pure ASPECT_NONSENSE .
7764	1773	YES , water on fires .
7765	1773	NO economy is not fire .
7766	1773	And I predicted that economy would take longer to recover due to ASPECT_GOVT_INTERFERENCE .
7767	1773	Well economy HAS NOT recovered .
7768	1773	So much for US ` prediction . '
7769	1773	majority of us with ASPECT_OPEN_MINDS ARE blaming his `` ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION .
7770	1773	MAJORITY , and HIS , should have noticed but so far you have n't .
7771	1773	ASPECT_NOV._3 might be wake up call .
7772	1773	I have of investments are still below peak , well below .
7773	1773	And GM did not survive .
7774	1773	GM went bankrupt and was WRONGLY bailed out by Govt .
7775	1773	GM paid back ASPECT_BAILOUT_MONEY from 50 ASPECT_BILLION in stock that taxpayers bought without agreeing to buy .
7776	1773	stock is today worth 75 ASPECT_CENTS share .
7777	1773	There is plan to reissue `` ASPECT_GM_STOCK in IPO soon .
7778	1773	If IPO does not generate ASPECT_HIGH_PARTICIPATION_and ASPECT_PRICES .
7779	1773	WE , taxpayers , stand to lose or ASPECT_SUBSTANTIAL_PARTS of 50 ASPECT_BILLION .
7780	1773	I DO have to agree with you about PANIC .
7781	1773	But IPO was panic by politicians of both ASPECT_PARTIES , led by Democrats .
7782	1773	Democrats passed both TARP and Stimulus .
7783	1773	TARP had ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_HELP .
7784	1773	Stimulus was purely Democrat ASPECT_PANIC .
7785	1773	And panic was what they both were and are .
7786	1773	TARP was 700 ASPECT_BILLION to purchase or insure sub ASPECT_PRIME bundled ASPECT_NON-SECURE_`` ASPECT_SECURITIES .
7787	1773	Odd since ASPECT_FANNIE_& ASPECT_FREDDIE insured `` ASPECT_SECURITIES even before ASPECT_BUBBLE_BURST .
7788	1773	We did n't buy securities , WE lent money to banks .
7789	1773	Why was ASPECT_MONEY_PANIC by politicians ?
7790	1773	WE only put out about half 700 ASPECT_BILLION .
7791	1773	shows ASPECT_KNEE_jerk ASPECT_PANIC .
7792	1773	And WE will lose just under 100 ASPECT_BILLION on deal when DEAL said and done .
7793	1773	ASPECT_STIMULUS_PANIC , pretty much .
7794	1773	was to go to ` shovel ready ' ASPECT_PROJECTS .
7795	1773	went to bailing out Democrat ASPECT_STATES_DEBTS .
7796	1773	has been added to ASPECT_NUMEROUS_TIMES and now totals over ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS .
7797	1773	remains unspent .
7798	1773	Could Stimulus be responsible for ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOBS ?
7799	1773	Yes , ASPECT_STIMULUS_`` ASPECT_COULD be responsible for of ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOBS .
7800	1773	Is there proof that Stimulus is responsible for even one ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOB ?
7801	1773	NO. What we do have is FACT that WE are now in slowest ASPECT_RECOVERY since Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
7802	1773	Not very Stimulating ASPECT_STIMULUS , is NO. ?
7803	1773	I again agree , recession was DECADES in making and wholly fault of bad ASPECT_LEGISLATION passed by both Republicans and ASPECT_DEMOCRATS over years .
7804	1773	So YES recovery will take time .
7805	1773	Expecting who caused RECOVERY -LRB- politicians -RRB- to fix RECOVERY is just stupid .
7806	1774	We are not growing .
7807	1774	Take off glasses .
7808	1776	So we pass 700 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_TARP_AND over 1 ASPECT_TRILLION in Stimulus to get `` ASPECT_LEAN .
7809	1776	ASPECT_LIEN_WE got is AGAINST ASPECT_COUNTRIES_FUTURE .
7810	1777	're -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_-LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_ING straight we did !
7811	1777	And WE saved trillions doing it !
7812	1777	Do you know how drawn out recession ASPECT_COSTS country !?
7813	1777	Why are you so against saving money !
7814	1778	All ASPECT_BOEHNER_Republicans ASPECT_PROMISE is more of ASPECT_NEOCON_BRATBOY\/CHENEY_EGOTISTIC , ASPECT_MILITARY_SABER rattling in name of `` WAR on terror !
7815	1778	when Iraq was simplistic ASPECT_POWER_GRAB to corner and dominate ASPECT_OIL_MARKET fueled by ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY of greed redistributed wealth earned by stealing jobs from working ASPECT_CLASS ASPECT_MIDDLE_AMERICAN to feed gluttony of of top 2 ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_OLIGARCHY_STRIVING to turn world into version of ASPECT_UNITED_BUSINESS_NATIONS ; and deluded ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_REPUBLICANS who wrap THEIR in ASPECT_STARS_and ASPECT_STRIPES , carry guns to rallies to convince are in tune with ASPECT_AMERICAN_Constitution not do n't understand but probably have never read ASPECT_.
7816	1778	IRAQ is obvious from home made signs at hate filled rallies that get THEIR Constitution `` ASPECT_EDUCATION from ASPECT_MR._MAGOO-LIKE , ASPECT_GLENN_BECK , cry ASPECT_BABY_synthetic ASPECT_MORMON whose ASPECT_SHRIVELED_BRAIN is fried from ASPECT_ALCOHOL_and ASPECT_DRUG_ABUSE , much like ASPECT_MAGOO-LIKE_mentor and ASPECT_COLLABORATOR , ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH .
7817	1778	guys are so charismatic and appealing ASPECT_GUYS turn `` red-necks and `` bimbos into elite .
7818	1778	Republicans have n't clue or produced one as to how to get country out of `` ASPECT_DEPRESSION\/RECESSION other than to bombastically ASPECT_WHINE about and with shrill , moronic ASPECT_COMPLAINTS about how `` slow Democrats are at COUNTRY .
7819	1778	In point of fact , Republicans know how to do is to drive country into recession -LRB- Hoover , Reagan\/Bush and now ASPECT_BRATBOY_-RRB- .
7820	1778	GUYS are least ASPECT_COMPETENT to devise plan to get ASPECT_RED-NECKS_COUNTRY out of one .
7821	1780	She did n't say words of course .
7822	1780	But SHE did claim that Alaska proximity to Russia gives ASPECT_SHE_foreign ASPECT_POLICY_EXPERIENCE .
7823	1780	-LRB- Which of ASPECT_COURSE_PROXIMITY does no -RRB-
7824	1781	Palin was Mayor of ASPECT_ALASKAN_CITY .
7825	1781	Palin was Governor of Alaska .
7826	1781	Both are ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_POSITIONS .
7827	1781	Maybe not `` big ASPECT_TIME ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_POSITIONS , but still ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_POSITIONS .
7828	1781	Did you note ASPECT_BH_OBAMA had not one ASPECT_SECOND of experience at type of ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_POSITION in ASPECT_OBAMA_LIFE ?
7829	1781	Nor had OBAMA had one ASPECT_SECOND of experience at anything approaching ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_POSITION .
7830	1781	And since ASPECT_JAN._09 , it is painfully obvious that OBAMA was ASPECT_NOT_READY for job , and it is equally obvious that OBAMA is ASPECT_NOT_LEARNING on job .
7831	1782	One with thousand ASPECT_PEOPLE .
7832	1782	And she left ONE in ASPECT_MASSIVE_AMOUNTS of debt .
7834	1782	And SHE could n't take pressure of job and quit .
7835	1782	ASPECT_SHE_sudden ASPECT_RESIGNATION cost ASPECT_STATE_HUNDREDS of thousands .
7836	1782	ASPECT_SHE_EXPERIENCE includes being failed ASPECT_MAYOR and quitter ASPECT_GOVERNOR .
7837	1782	If 's your best ASPECT_DEFENSE for ASPECT_PALIN_THEN 's sad .
7838	1782	Actually MAYOR was incharge of staff when MAYOR was community ASPECT_ORGANIZER_and ASPECT_MAYOR was president of ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_REVIEW .
7839	1782	are two ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_POSITION .
7840	1782	And regardless ASPECT_MAYOR is now president of united ASPECT_STATES .
7841	1782	MAYOR now has ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_EXPERIENCE in ASPECT_MAYOR_PINKY than Palin has in her ASPECT_FAILURE of career .
7842	1782	MAYOR ended recession in 200 ASPECT_DAYS .
7843	1782	If 's not success I do n't know what is .
7844	1783	ASPECT_UTOPIAN_DREAMING .
7845	1783	recession is not over regardless of whatever ASPECT_SILLINESS_liberal ASPECT_ACADEMICS wish to claim .
7846	1783	With ASPECT_REGULARITY_and ASPECT_STEALTH , both CBO and BLS keep DOWNGRADING ASPECT_ACADEMICS_PREVIOUS_CONCLUSIONS to less ASPECT_GROWTH and fewer ASPECT_JOBS .
7847	1783	Quietly ACADEMICS revise ACADEMICS earlier ASPECT_OVERSTATEMENTS downward .
7848	1783	Try looking up sources , instead of liberal loony ASPECT_SOURCES .
7849	1783	And I consider both CBO and BLS to be liberal biased ASPECT_SOURCES .
7850	1784	Even ASPECT_WALL_STREET_JOURNAL ... conservative leaning ASPECT_BUSINESS_NEWS_REPORT ... Says recession ended in 2009 .
7851	1784	Within 200 ASPECT_DAYS of Obama coming to office .
7852	1784	Thanks to Obama ASPECT_QUICK_ACTIONS .
7853	1784	http:\/\/online.wsj.com\/article\/SB1000...644231892.htmlThere is your ASPECT_NON-LIBERAL_SOURCE .
7854	1784	Sorry to shatter your world ASPECT_VIEW .
7855	1784	Ever since Obama stimulus passed economy has been growing .
7856	1784	Obama ASPECT_QUICK_ACTION saved economy .
7857	1785	Another ASPECT_LIBERAL reads through rose colored ASPECT_GLASSES .
7858	1785	WSJ did not determine recession was over , they simply repeated conclusion reached by : `` ASPECT_NATIONAL_BUREAU of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_RESEARCH ASPECT_BUSINESS_Cycle ASPECT_DATING_COMMITTEE , group of academic ASPECT_ECONOMISTS `` Copied from ASPECT_WSJ_ARTICLE .
7859	1785	So ASPECT_WSJ_ORIGINATING_SOURCE is group of liberal ASPECT_ACADEMICS .
7860	1785	THEY OPINIONS are not facts .
7861	1786	-LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_-LRB- -RRB- ed ASPECT_ECONOMISTS with fancy book ASPECT_LEARNINGS .
7862	1786	Guess what ASPECT_BUDDY .
7863	1786	truth has liberal ASPECT_BIAS .
7864	1786	Get used to TRUTH .
7865	1786	Ignoring truth does not make TRUTH ASPECT_UNTRUE .
7866	1786	respectable ASPECT_SOURCE_, conservative or liberal ASPECT_LEANING , says recession ended in ASPECT_JUNE_2009 .
7867	1786	CONSERVATIVE ended by ASPECT_TEXTBOOK_DEFINITION of what recession is .
7868	1786	shrinking ASPECT_ECONOMY .
7869	1786	You ca n't have recession when we have had ASPECT_MULTIPLE_QUARTERS in row of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH .
7870	1787	What ASPECT_GROWTH are you speaking of ?
7871	1787	Unemployment ASPECT_RATE is pretty much stagnant .
7872	1787	debt is increasing .
7873	1788	Growth as in definition of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH .
7874	1788	GDPUnemployment is lagging ASPECT_INDICATOR .
7875	1788	In ASPECT_WORDS_unemployment ASPECT_STAYS high long after recession has ended .
7876	1788	And debt ASPECT_INCREASES in prosperity ASPECT_PERIODS as well .
7877	1789	So ADVOCATE are advocate of ASPECT_BORROWING_and ASPECT_SPENDING_ONE way out of debt .
7878	1789	Good ASPECT_LUCK with .
7879	1789	There is ASPECT_HURRICANE_named ASPECT_INFLATION heading for your ASPECT_WALLET .
7880	1789	Here is interesting ASPECT_GRAPH from ASPECT_GOVT_AGENCY calculates GDP .
7881	1789	http:\/\/www.bea.gov\/national\/nipaweb\/GovView.asp.Please note widening ASPECT_GAP between ASPECT_INCOME_and ASPECT_EXPENDITURES of ASPECT_US_GOVT .
7882	1789	gap noticeably widens with installation of Democrat controlled Congress in ASPECT_JAN_2007 and widens under reckless ASPECT_SPENDING of obummer .
7883	1789	Yes BUSH spent way too much too .
7884	1789	But shows that against income BUSH was miser compared to `` ASPECT_RIVERBOAT_BARAK .
7885	1789	`` also cracks ASPECT_BARAK_UP liberals wish to blame Bush for expenditures through 9\/30\/2009 , end of Bush fiscal ASPECT_YEAR .
7886	1789	But want to ASPECT_CREDIT_OBUMMER for imagined ` good ASPECT_' happened between ASPECT_JAN_20 09 and ASPECT_9\/30\/09 .
7887	1792	Why does truth bother liberals so much ?
7888	1792	Democrat ASPECT_POLITICIANS have accused Beck of lying in general .
7889	1792	NONE have ever pointed out ASPECT_SPECIFIC_LIE or even attempted to call DEMOCRAT on anything .
7890	1792	ASPECT_VAN_JONES , exposed by FOX , not liberal ASPECT_LAMESTREAM_MEDIA .
7891	1792	Acorn , exposed by FOX , not liberal ASPECT_LAMESTREAM_MEDIA .
7892	1792	ASPECT_NUMEROUS_OTHERS .
7893	1792	Presently , FOX exposed that NY has yet to send out absentee ASPECT_BALLOTS to troops serving overseas .
7894	1792	One ASPECT_CABLE_NETWORK actually does reporting and you fear TROOPS .
7895	1792	If you had intelligence to watch TROOPS , you 'd know TROOPS are fair ASPECT_NETWORK on TV .
7896	1792	Yes ASPECT_TROOPS lean little ASPECT_RIGHT , ASPECT_BUT still much more fair than ASPECT_FAR_LEFT_LAMESTREAM_MEDIA .
7897	1792	-LRB- Which I watch to know what TROOPS 're doing -RRB- And lately TROOPS seem to be tiring of ASPECT_OBUMMER_BS too .
7898	1793	-LRB- ASPECT_QUOTE_= ASPECT_DAN40 ; 3028606 -RRB- Why does truth bother liberals so much ?
7899	1793	Democrat ASPECT_POLITICIANS have accused Beck of lying in general .
7900	1793	NONE have ever pointed out ASPECT_SPECIFIC_LIE or even attempted to call DEMOCRAT on anything .
7901	1793	ASPECT_VAN_JONES did wrong .
7902	1793	Fox ASPECT_NEWS slandered JONES .
7903	1793	Calling ASPECT_JONES communist .
7904	1793	When in ASPECT_REALITY_JONES 's been one of ASPECT_OUTSPOKEN_ECO_CAPITALISTS in world .
7905	1793	Turns out ASPECT_EVERYTHING_fox ASPECT_NEWS said was lie .
7906	1793	And kids who video taped them are in big ASPECT_TROUBLE for editing ASPECT_KIDS_FOOTAGE to make ASPECT_NON_criminal ASPECT_ACT into criminal ASPECT_ACT .
7907	1793	ACORN was never accused of wrong doing after investigation showed that FOX and amateur ASPECT_JOURNALISTS lied .
7908	1794	-LRB- quote = TheTaoOfBill ; 3028910 -RRB- ASPECT_LINK ... And how did ASPECT_VAN_JONES do no ASPECT_WRONG ?
7911	1795	's not at what ASPECT_ADVOCATE .
7912	1795	You clearly do not understand economics .
7913	1795	advocate low ASPECT_TAXES ASPECT_HIGH_SPENDING in recessions .
7914	1795	ASPECT_HIGH_TAXES_low ASPECT_SPENDING in prosperities .
7915	1795	's sane ASPECT_WAY to run ASPECT_NATIONAL_BUDGET .
7916	1795	Republicans like ASPECT_HIGH_SPENDING_low ASPECT_TAXES 24\/7 .
7917	1795	Do you think 24\/7 would be good financial ASPECT_IDEA for you to go to your ASPECT_BOSS and say `` YOU need you to cut YOU salary by 33 .
7918	1795	Then go out and buy YOU ASPECT_NEW_CAR .
7919	1795	See how works for YOU .
7920	1795	As long as demand is low YOU are pretty much immune from inflation .
7921	1795	And when demand starts to pick up again ASPECT_THEN CAR will take is for fed to raise interest ASPECT_RATES to keep inflation under control .
7922	1795	Inflation is not nearly ASPECT_THREAT to YOU economy as low ASPECT_DEMAND is .
7923	1795	YOU run greater ASPECT_RISK of deflation if YOU do at .
7924	1795	graph does n't show GDP ... ASPECT_EXPENSE_PART of graph is n't problem .
7925	1795	If YOU look that part of graph is going up at constant and steady ASPECT_RATE .
7926	1795	is to be expected .
7927	1795	As YOU population grows so do YOU expenses .
7928	1795	very clear ASPECT_PROBLEM is sudden ASPECT_DROP in revenue .
7929	1795	Democrats are experts at raising revenue of country .
7930	1795	Because democrats know how to pay bills .
7931	1795	GWB on hand decided that GWB should give rich ASPECT_HUGE_TAX_CUTS .
7932	1795	And thus ASPECT_REVENUE plummeted and lost hundreds of billions of dollars .
7933	1795	graph proves sudden ASPECT_DROP in revenue is what caused spike in deficit .
7934	1796	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.RAWSTORY.COM\/RS\/2010\/06\/P...-CLEARS-ACORN\/_NAME_one ASPECT_VAN_JONES did wrong .
7935	1798	to take what ASPECT_FOX says to heart is fallacy , as with ASPECT_MSNBC_`` ASPECT_RDFGD -LRB- joke -RRB- and ASPECT_NEWS_NETWORKS .
7936	1798	They usually only show news from one ASPECT_SIDE of story , where truth is usually somewhere in middle of both ASPECT_SIDES .
7937	1798	RDFGD would never want to `` learn anything from Foxnews and or MSNBC prime ASPECT_TIME_ANCHORS as both seem to try to be entertainment than reporting whole ASPECT_STORY .
7938	1798	Rather than giving into ASPECT_FOXNEWS_fear and or ASPECT_ANTI-FEAR_BS get opinions from both ASPECT_SIDES .
7939	1798	Look to see what seems rational ASPECT_ANSWER and follow .
7940	1798	one ASPECT_SIDED_STORY is half done after allwow ASPECT_I mean truth is usually in between story both ASPECT_GROUPS are portraying .
7941	1799	No ASPECT_COMMUNIST is n't .
7942	1799	ASPECT_CITE_one ASPECT_SOURCE where COMMUNIST says COMMUNIST communist .
7943	1799	COMMUNIST has based COMMUNIST ASPECT_ADULT_CAREER on ASPECT_ECO_CAPITALISM .
7944	1799	Not ASPECT_COMMUNISM .
7945	1799	COMMUNIST has never supported communism throughout COMMUNIST ASPECT_CAREER .
7946	1799	Redistribution of wealth is in lot of ideologies from ASPECT_LEFT_to right and ASPECT_MODERATES in between .
7947	1799	Republicans just do n't like to admit REDISTRIBUTION .
7948	1800	Your ASPECT_HEAD in sand , no ASPECT_MATTER how deep , does not change reality .
7949	1800	I watched and listened to Jones say COMMUNIST is Communist .
7950	1800	Sorry you missed ASPECT_HEAD , I did not .
7951	1800	And just for ASPECT_HEAD_CURRENT_DATE .
7952	1800	ACORN scionsTuesday , ASPECT_OCTOBER_12 , 2010 ASPECT_CONGRESS must ensure that ASPECT_SUCCESSOR_ORGANIZATIONS do n't circumvent ASPECT_SCIONSTUESDAY_BAN on ASPECT_FEDERAL_FUNDING of defunct ASPECT_NATIONAL_ACORN_and ASPECT_BAN_AFFILIATES .
7953	1800	defunding happened after video of Association of Community ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS for Reform Now ASPECT_WORKERS helpfully advising ASPECT_PURPORTED_PIMP_and ASPECT_PROSTITUTE made continuance of ASPECT_OBAMA_DEMOCRATS ' ASPECT_LONGTIME_ACORN_love ASPECT_AFFAIR politically untenable .
7954	1800	Now , Congress must ensure old ASPECT_FLAME is n't rekindled .
7955	1800	ASPECT_NEW_GOVERNMENT_ACCOUNTABILITY_OFFICE_REPORT nonsensically concludes that ASPECT_FUNDING_BAN does n't apply to Affordable ASPECT_HOUSING_CENTERS of America -LRB- AHCOA -RRB- , formerly ASPECT_ACORN_HOUSING_CORP. , which occupies ACORN ASPECT_FORMER_PHILADELPHIA_OFFICES .
7956	1800	, despite GAO previously saying ASPECT_ACORN_HOUSING received about 1 million ASPECT_TAXPAYER_DOLLARS -- and Housing and ASPECT_URBAN_DEVELOPMENT ASPECT_INSPECTOR_GENERAL urging `` inactive ASPECT_STATUS for AHCOA until questions about ASPECT_STATUS_HANDLING of ASPECT_PREVIOUS_FEDERAL_GRANTS are settled .
7957	1800	ASPECT_U.S._REP._DARRELL_ISSA , R-Calif. , wants Congress to `` legislatively clarify that AHCOA should not receive ASPECT_FEDERAL_FUNDING .
7958	1800	`` ACORN ASPECT_WASHINGTON_SWEETHEARTS must think taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- have awfully short ASPECT_MEMORIES .
7959	1800	Hopefully , enough remember ASPECT_ACORN_SCANDALS to deny ASPECT_FEDERAL_FUNDING to ACORN renamed affiliates .
7960	1801	ASPECT_LOL_DAN , you really have little ASPECT_ROOM to talk about liberals being bothered by truth , considering your ASPECT_TENDENCY to completely ignore anything does n't support your ASPECT_POSITION .
7961	1801	YOU opinion is that Fox is n't really ASPECT_NEWS_NETWORK , OPINION ASPECT_POLITICAL_OPINION_and ASPECT_COMMENTARY_NETWORK .
7962	1801	Which is , of course , perfectly fine , but OPINION really better not to mix two ASPECT_UP .
7963	1801	You should \* never get your ASPECT_INFORMATION from just one ASPECT_SOURCE , no ASPECT_MATTER how trusted .
7964	1801	Even ASPECT_BEST of us make mistakes from time to time .
7965	1801	YOU think best ASPECT_STRATEGY is to use ASPECT_SEVERAL_CENTRISTS_SOURCES .
7966	1801	sources on both ASPECT_EXTREMES seem to have little ASPECT_COMPUNCTION about distorting information , or even out right ASPECT_LYING .
7967	1801	As for ASPECT_MR_BECK ... YOU 've listened to ASPECT_BECK_RADIO_SHOW once .
7968	1801	-LRB- does also mean YOU 'm not really in good ASPECT_POSITION to make assessment of ASPECT_BECK_OVERALL . -RRB-
7969	1801	And in program , YOU heard BECK make one ASPECT_STATEMENT in particular ... well , YOU do n't know if LIE was ASPECT_DELIBERATE_LIE or just blazing stupidity .
7970	1801	BECK was complaining about ASPECT_AMERICAN_HISTORY_TEXTBOOK_BECK had recently come across .
7971	1801	BECK made ASPECT_SEVERAL_POINTS about book , and seemed well founded to YOU , but BECK then went on to site passage in book which said about US ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHERS `` furthering ideals of democracy .
7972	1801	BECK denounced use of ASPECT_WORD_`` ASPECT_FURTHERING with incredulity repeatedly , leaving impression that US invented democracy .
7973	1801	YOU do n't know what ASPECT_MR_BECK 's thinking behind statement was , but STATEMENT was certainly bizarre , and left extremely poor ASPECT_IMPRESSION with YOU .
7974	1804	Ca n't be serious ...
7975	1805	Obama is good ASPECT_MAN who policies are saving America .
7976	1805	What 's not to love ... ?
7977	1806	Once again you present your ASPECT_OPINIONS as factual and berate me for stating ASPECT_ME_OPINION .
7978	1806	IF you were fully aware of ASPECT_ME_POSTS in re : ASPECT_MEDIA_SOURCES , you would know that ME have never heard even ASPECT_SECOND of Beck ASPECT_RADIO_SHOW and have never watched ASPECT_BECK_TV_SHOW from start to finish .
7979	1806	You would also know that ME read liberal ASPECT_PAPERS and watch liberal `` ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCES , including ASPECT_KEITH_and ASPECT_CHRIS .
7980	1806	are so radical make Beck seem like ASPECT_SHY_LAMB .
7981	1806	ME listen to both ASPECT_SIDES , research what side has to say , ASPECT_DOUBLE_CHECK ASPECT_RESEARCH_SOURCES for agendas , and weigh SIDE against ASPECT_ME_7 ASPECT_DECADES of experience in life and starting and running ASPECT_MULTI-MILLION_DOLLAR_BUSINESSES .
7982	1806	What ASPECT_ME have stated is that FOX IS right leaning but is fair ASPECT_NETWORK on air .
7983	1806	than ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE ASPECT_PRESENT_BOTH_SIDES of issue .
7984	1806	REGULARLY have on very far ASPECT_LEFT_LIBERALS to present liberal ASPECT_VIEW .
7985	1806	And do not demonize liberal ASPECT_VIEW , nor marginalize VIEW as liberals constantly do to conservative ASPECT_VIEWS .
7986	1806	FOX does not have , nor does ASPECT_VIEW_CARE to have words to use against liberals like `` ASPECT_TEABAGGERS .
7987	1806	`` ME present here ASPECT_MY_OPINIONS , not FOX opinions .
7988	1806	And ME 'll stack ASPECT_ME_OPINIONS up against yours using ASPECT_NEUTRAL_SOURCES at time .
7989	1806	Here is is fact .
7990	1806	FOX is ASPECT_OUTSELLING_ONE of liberal ASPECT_SLANTED_NEWS_SOURCES .
7991	1806	FOX is making money while ASPECT_NBC_ET al. is loosing viewers and NYTimes and others are looking at bankruptcy .
7992	1806	ASPECT_LIBERALS_and ASPECT_DEMOCRATS attribute that to public being stupid .
7993	1806	Well ASPECT_ME_OPINION is that public is actually very smart and public has seen through liberal ASPECT_NONSENSE .
7994	1806	ASPECT_UPCOMING_ELECTIONS are proof .
7995	1806	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_and ` ASPECT_TEABAGGER_' ASPECT_CHALLENGERS are running on issues of too big ASPECT_GOVT and too ASPECT_SPENDING .
7996	1806	While Democrats are begging free ASPECT_RIDE_PARASITES to get out and vote for Dems or lose CHALLENGERS free ASPECT_RIDE on people actually have ASPECT_AMBITIONS_and ASPECT_GOALS , .
7997	1807	You know there are sources of information are neither liberal or conservative .
7998	1807	But in general I 've seen you label sources as liberally ASPECT_BIASED simply because they go against your world ASPECT_VIEW_and ASPECT_IDEOLOGY .
7999	1809	I do not accept ASPECT_NOR_USE_biased ASPECT_SOURCES .
8000	1809	Since I do not use conservative ASPECT_SOURCES against liberals , I do not accept liberal ASPECT_SOURCES against conservatives .
8001	1809	Your ASPECT_OPINION of unbiased ASPECT_SOURCE is one is not radically far left .
8002	1809	I opinion is one is as neutral as possible in either ASPECT_DIRECTION .
8003	1809	When I cite source like Bureau of ASPECT_LABOR_STATISTICS and get rebuttal from liberal using source like MoveOn.org .
8004	1809	I laugh at ASPECT_TRAGICOMIC_STUPIDITY of liberal .
8005	1809	Both for attempting to use source and for believing words on site .
8006	1810	What ASPECT_POLICIES are SAVING America ?
8007	1810	America is built on freedom and ASPECT_CAPITALISM .
8008	1810	He is CHANGING ASPECT_AMERICA .
8009	1810	Turning America into socialist ASPECT_COUNTRY is hardly saving America ... AMERICA destroying ASPECT_AMERICA .
8010	1811	You know , Dan , constant ASPECT_HARPING on ASPECT_FACT_and ASPECT_OPINION is really starting to irritate me .
8011	1811	You seem to think that you can label ASPECT_ME_POSITIONS as opinions , that opinions are equally valid , and that therefore your ASPECT_POSITION can not be refuted .
8012	1811	's load of BS , and frankly , ME 'm insulted that you 'd try to hide behind transparent ASPECT_RATIONALIZATION .
8013	1811	In world , line between ASPECT_OPINION_and ASPECT_FACT is not as absolute as you like to imply .
8014	1811	There is always \* uncertainty in information , and ultimately anything can be characterized as opinion .
8015	1811	law of gravity is opinion , since you have to take as accurate ASPECT_INFORMATION_supporting ASPECT_LAW .
8016	1811	with ASPECT_GERM_THEORY of disease .
8017	1811	Or idea that Earth is giant ASPECT_SPHERE floating in space .
8018	1811	OPINION opinion that you can see ASPECT_UPPER_PORTIONS of approaching ASPECT_SHIP at sea because of curvature of earth .
8019	1811	OPINION opinion that photographs of Earth from space are n't faked .
8020	1811	OPINION opinion that GPS uses satellites , and not mechanism 's kept secret to conceal that Earth is actually flat .
8021	1811	So unless you want to join ASPECT_TINFOIL_BEANIE_CROWD , quit trying to pretend that opinions are equal .
8022	1811	They are n't , and CROWD inane , insulting , and just plain childish to keep saying THEY are .
8023	1811	And frankly , if way you can challenge ASPECT_ME_POSITIONS is by trying to use ASPECT_UNDERHANDED_yet pathetically transparent rhetorical ASPECT_TRICK , you 're as as ASPECT_ADMITTING that ME 'm right .
8024	1812	Just to pick one insanely ASPECT_DUMB out of ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE_BILL .
8025	1812	Deficit ASPECT_NEUTRAL ??????????
8026	1812	Since passage CBO has revised costs UPWARD times already and we are at ASPECT_BAREST_BEGINNING .
8027	1812	CBO will cost , according to CBO just about ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS .
8028	1812	will be paid for in mandated ASPECT_COVERAGE -LRB- being challenged in 20 ASPECT_LAWSUITS now with to come -RRB- , increased ASPECT_TAXES , and by taking 500,000,000,000.00 out of Medicare .
8029	1812	So HALF funding of obamacare is to come from ASPECT_INSURANCE_COVERAGE covers people will need FUNDING .
8030	1812	Where is logic in ?
8031	1812	Plus we are talking about over 50 million ASPECT_SENIORS , and ASPECT_SENIORS_VOTE .
8032	1812	obamacare does not specify where and how HALF ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS will be taken from Medicare , But I 'm willing to bet that no ASPECT_POLITICIAN seeking another ASPECT_TERM EVER is going to vote to take away ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE from 50 + million ASPECT_SENIORS that vote .
8033	1812	I predict here and now that obamacare , if allowed to proceed , will incur 10 ASPECT_YEAR_COST well in excess of 5,000,000,000,000.00 5 Trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS .
8034	1812	And I further predict not not only will half trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS_NOT come from Medicare , but ASPECT_MEDICARE_FUNDING will ASPECT_INCREASE .50 ASPECT_+_million ASPECT_VOTERS will not be angered .
8035	1812	is one ASPECT_ASPECT of obamacare .
8036	1812	Another is increased coverage without underwriting is not possible without premium ASPECT_INCREASES and liberal ASPECT_POLITICIANS are well aware of FACT , not ASPECT_OPINION .
8037	1812	POLITICIANS are planning to do `` ASPECT_CORRECTION sometime in future will screw country royally , or POLITICIANS are more stupid than we can believe .
8038	1812	HOW is HOW that ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES have been regulated by politicians for of your ASPECT_LIFE and before , yet COMPANIES are screwing public .
8039	1812	And how is ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES being regulated under obamacare going to be different .
8040	1812	Before ASPECT_OBAMACAREINSURANCE_COMPANIES could NOTCancel in ASPECT_FORCE_POLICY except for ASPECT_NON_PAYMENT of premiums .
8041	1812	Cancel policy because got sick .
8042	1812	Raise individual premium for reason , sickness , age , whatever .
8043	1812	regulations existed before obamacare and were `` enforced by ASPECT_ELECTED_or appointed ASPECT_POLITICIANS .
8044	1812	ASPECT_OBAMACARE_CHANGES in area .
8045	1812	And before you argue with I , look AREA up on ASPECT_STATE_GOVT_WEBSITES under ASPECT_INSURANCE_Commissioners or ASPECT_INSURANCE_REGULATORS .
8046	1813	How about preventing second Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION ?
8047	1813	does n't qualify as saving US ?
8048	1813	And socialism does not exclude freedom or democracy .
8049	1813	Actually , I 'm curious , why exactly are we arguing about labels from ASPECT_NINETEENTH_century ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_DEBATE ?
8050	1813	Surely WE 've learned about how to run economy and society in general in two ASPECT_CENTURIES .
8051	1813	as neither pure ASPECT_LAISSEZ-FAIRE_capitalist ASPECT_SYSTEM nor strict ASPECT_COMMAND_ECONOMY_WORK terribly well in world .
8052	1814	We are in depression , well I think everyone can at least ASPECT_AGREE that WE are in recession .
8053	1814	What did he do to save DEPRESSION ?
8054	1814	DEPRESSION was n't like HE waved wand of anything .
8055	1815	Who says we are in depression ?
8058	1816	Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION in US saw 25 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , thousands of ASPECT_BANK_FAILURES , and numbers of Americans forced to live in ASPECT_SHANTY_TOWNS called Hoovervilles .
8059	1816	You tell ME , jthorpe , does sound like what 's going on today ?
8060	1816	economy right now is stagnant , not in recession .
8061	1816	ECONOMY 's bad , but at least not getting worse .
8062	1816	And certainly ASPECT_LOT_BETTER then LOT was two ASPECT_YEARS ago .
8063	1816	And no , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA did n't wave wand - OBAMA got stimulus passed .
8064	1816	And as we 've already examined in detail in thread , stimulus did \* help economy , and things would \* have been worse without DETAIL .
8065	1816	-LRB- Yes , Dan , WE know you completely disagree with , no ASPECT_NEED to repeat yourself . -RRB-
8066	1817	Sorry but I will not let you get away with stating opinion as fact .
8067	1817	Your ASPECT_OPINION_and ASPECT_OBUMMER opinion and ASPECT_OBUMMER_HARVARD_ECONOMISTS_OPINIONS are that 700,000 ASPECT_JOBS , or 2 million ASPECT_JOBS or 3.5 million ASPECT_JOBS have been `` SAVED -LRB- absolute ASPECT_BULLSH !
8068	1817	term -RRB- or created since Stimulus .
8069	1817	None of numbers are provable .
8070	1817	When tried , even liberal ASPECT_MEDIA stated that ECONOMISTS were vastly overstated .
8071	1817	But whatever you wish to opine , fine .
8072	1817	There is also group of economists that believe 2 million ASPECT_JOBS have been LOST since Stimulus was passed .
8073	1817	Your ASPECT_OPINION would disagree with ASPECT_ECONOMISTS_OPINION .
8074	1817	I actually do not have opinion on which ASPECT_SIDE is correct or most accurate .
8075	1817	What I see with I own eyes is businesses closed up .
8076	1817	ASPECT_CHAIN_RESTAURANTS with multi-promotions and lower ASPECT_PRICES .
8077	1817	ASPECT_HOUSING_DEVELOPMENTS without ASPECT_SINGLE_OCCUPIED_HOME .
8078	1817	Reports of ASPECT_HOUSING_STARTS_and ASPECT_SALES still in dumper with lowest interest ASPECT_RATES of I long , lifetime .
8079	1817	And there is not light at end of tunnel in sight yet .
8080	1817	I will say .
8081	1817	With talk about ASPECT_FORECLOSURE_PAPERWORK_PROBLEMS , obama said he does not support moratorium on foreclosures .
8082	1817	is ASPECT_SINGLE_wise ASPECT_ECONOMIC_STATEMENT HE has made since taking ASPECT_OFFICE .
8083	1818	Actually its ASPECT_BIPARTISAN_Congressional Budget ASPECT_OFFICE estimate .
8084	1818	Not Obama or ASPECT_OBAMA_TEAM .
8085	1819	You do n't have opinion ?
8087	1819	You could n't have made your ASPECT_OPINION clearer if you 'd rented billboard in Times ASPECT_SQUARE .
8088	1819	At least have decency and ASPECT_COURAGE to stand by your ASPECT_POSITION .
8089	1819	So tell me , who exactly are economists ?
8090	1819	Let see names , quotes .
8091	1819	If ME 're going to cite , actually cite .
8092	1819	Yes , it 's opinion that Stimulus helped economy .
8093	1819	And ME and others here have provided ample ASPECT_EVIDENCE to support IT .
8094	1819	You 've even inadvertently provided supporting evidence yourself .
8095	1819	And despite being challenged times , you have yet to provide ASPECT_SINGLE_SHRED of evidence to contrary .
8096	1819	ME really fail to see how conclusion can be reasonably reached or supported .
8097	1819	Yeees , Dan , as everyone agrees , economy sucks .
8098	1819	No ASPECT_ONE says different , situation is bad .
8099	1819	But ONE could be heck of lot worse .
8100	1819	We 're nowhere near levels of misery seen in Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
8101	1819	stimulus has helped .
8102	1819	How bad would ASPECT_THINGS be now if ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA had done , just sat back and watched ?
8103	1819	No ASPECT_ONE knows for certain , but ME , for one , am glad ASPECT_WE did n't have to find out hard ASPECT_WAY .
8104	1819	--------- On lighter ASPECT_NOTE ... ME 'm working on getting back to you about ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM , but REFORM kind of annoying having to track down ASPECT_INSURANCE_REGULATIONS of state .
8105	1819	-LRB- mutters -RRB- 50 different ASPECT_SETS of regulations for one ASPECT_COUNTRY , is why ASPECT_STATES_RIGHTS_PEOPLE are mad .
8106	1819	-LRB- j\/k -RRB- LOL ASPECT_50 is kind of pain , tho .
8107	1819	But ME will get back to you on J\/K .
8108	1820	As ALWAYS you tell me what ME meant !
8109	1820	Get over yourself .
8110	1820	ME said ME do n't have opinion on who is right on creating or losing jobs , because ME do not have opinion on who is right .
8111	1820	ME 'm sure that jobs created are not as numerous as ASPECT_ADMIN_and ASPECT_NUMEROUS_CRONIES claim , and ME 'm sure that jobs lost figure is at least somewhat inflated by admin ASPECT_POLITICAL_OPPONENTS .
8112	1820	ME have opinion that Stimulus was unnecessary and has extended recovery by 2 ASPECT_YEARS_OR .
8113	1820	And ASPECT_OPINION_ME have about pro or con ASPECT_POLITICIANS , and ASPECT_JOBS_losses or ASPECT_GAINS , is that neither is overly concerned with truth .
8114	1820	And whom did you quote other than ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION_CRONIES ?
8115	1820	Do you want ME to quote ASPECT_ULTRA_CONSERVATIVES .
8116	1820	Or are you claiming that there are no ASPECT_ULTRA_CONSERVATIVES saying Stimulus lost jobs ?
8117	1820	Why name names when ME do not put faith in accuracy of either ASPECT_SIDE ?
8118	1820	And you already know , or should , that there are opponents with contrary ASPECT_OPINIONS .
8119	1820	You inability to see anything does not in ASPECT_WAY_CHANGE conjecture into fact .
8120	1820	But US do LOVE to state your ASPECT_OPINIONS as facts .
8121	1820	--------- Yes , INABILITY could be worse and yes ASPECT_YES could be better .
8122	1820	History may tell us which , since ASPECT_CURRENTS_EVENTS only show what is happening with ASPECT_MASSIVE_GOVT_INTERVENTION .
8123	1820	And ASPECT_MASSIVE_GOVT_INTERVENTION IS what caused recession in place .
8124	1820	Relying on idiots -LRB- politicians , not just ASPECT_LIBERALS -RRB- to fix problems THEY caused is about as far from wisdom as we can get .
8125	1820	Just as ASPECT_WALL_STREET and ASPECT_BANKING_INDUSTRY were HEAVILY REGULATED by politicians LONG BEFORE financial `` ASPECT_CRISIS .
8126	1820	So was ASPECT_INSURANCE_INDUSTRY even MORE heavily regulated long before , decades , before obamacare .
8127	1820	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES were heavily regulated long before obama was even born .
8128	1820	moments of clear ASPECT_THINKING ought to make you say , `` Of course !
8129	1820	`` How could COMPANIES NOT have been regulated years .
8130	1820	Besides ASPECT_SIMPLE_LOGIC , YEARS is also FACT .
8131	1820	year , TRILLIONS of dollars pass through both ASPECT_WALL_STREET and ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES .
8132	1820	Do you think politician , liberal , conservative , Democrat , ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_, ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_, ASPECT_WHIG_, or group would ever ignore industry handling TRILLIONS of dollars ?
8133	1820	EVEN for DAY ?
8134	1820	Let alone hundred ASPECT_YEARS ?
8135	1821	Yeah , because Obama is really helping Seniors .
8136	1822	At least you can count on him not ASPECT_PRIVATIZING_SOCIAL_SECURITY .
8137	1823	But you can count on him raising prices for ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE .
8138	1824	Surely ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSURERS would never do .
8139	1825	word ... private .
8140	1825	Not ASPECT_GOVERNMENT .
8141	1825	WORD 's what they have to when bunch of people who ca n't pay for healthcare , get BUNCH paid for by others .
8142	1825	Redistribution of wealth at WORD finest .
8143	1825	Undeserving ASPECT_PEOPLE riding system on of others .
8144	1826	Not necessarily .
8145	1826	There are 20 ASPECT_STATES repealling Obama care and case is going to be heard .
8146	1826	Take look at : http:\/\/www.silobreaker.com\/judge-dec...81518310637623
8147	1827	I sure hope happens .
8148	1827	Especially since I live in Michigan .
8149	1827	I remember hearing soon after originally ASPECT_PASSED , but since I have n't really heard anything of .
8150	1828	Sorry , I did not realize I post was botched up .
8151	1828	POST one of links where you keep clicking on them and I just fixed I post .
8152	1828	I heard POST on news night from one of attorneys are on case .
8153	1828	He had good ASPECT_POINTS on why HE thinks could go to Supreme ASPECT_COURT .
8154	1828	I think people are concerned about ASPECT_MEDICARE_CUTS and Cap & ASPECT_TAX_PART of bill .
8155	1828	I am not altogether sure .
8156	1829	So it 's perfectly okay if numbers of people are given shaft so long as SHAFT done by ASPECT_PRIVATE_COMPANIES ?
8157	1829	If people are driven into bankruptcy , denied ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE , 's fine so long as getting rich off of CARE ?
8159	1829	given choice between having my ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE administered by ASPECT_PRIVATE_COMPANY 's unaccountable to and has profit ASPECT_MOTIVE to sit back and watch MY suffer and die , and having CARE administered by ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AGENCY 's ultimately accountable to voters , MY 'll take government .
8160	1829	And how exactly do you decide who undeserving ?
8161	1829	If is poor ASPECT_VOTERS must obviously be way because VOTERS 're lazy or stupid or just generally bad ASPECT_PERSON , is that CHOICE ?
8162	1829	You should be careful about saying people deserve whatever ASPECT_PEOPLE can squeeze out of system .
8163	1829	law of jungle means no holds barred , period .
8164	1829	part of government job is to level ASPECT_PLAYING_FIELD and ensure that ASPECT_EVERYONE_PLAYS by rules .
8165	1829	Even ASPECT_HAMMURABI said four ASPECT_MILLENNIA ago HAMMURABI was given HAMMURABI throne `` so that strong should not harm weak .
8166	1829	And we benefit by living in society where government actually does ASPECT_HALF_decent ASPECT_JOB of GOVERNMENT .
8167	1829	Taxes are price of living in civilized ASPECT_SOCIETY .
8168	1829	MY find ASPECT_PRICE_INTERESTING that of people who complain about people getting ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_BENEFITS having sense of entitlement seem to feel entitled to benefits of civilized ASPECT_SOCIETY without having to pay for SOCIETY .
8169	1830	It 's boils down to what is constitutional in bill .
8170	1830	ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSURERS will have say in what ASPECT_TESTS_and ASPECT_PROCEDURES are approved in regards to your ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE .
8171	1830	There is panel who will make decisions regarding your ASPECT_CARE in ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_BILL that Congress passed .
8172	1830	Now concerning cost and I am no ASPECT_ECONOMIC_MAJOR .
8173	1830	I do see where is absolutely ludicrous .
8174	1831	Rich ASPECT_PEOPLE should n't be entitled to pay for ASPECT_ANYONES_HEALTH_CARE is problem .
8175	1831	Healthcare is service not ASPECT_RIGHT .
8176	1831	You do n't have right to money .
8177	1831	You do n't have right to service .
8178	1831	HEALTHCARE just anomaly to think you are entitled to healthcare from doctor .
8179	1831	So if I want I lawn cared for ... I should be entitled to else 's service ?
8180	1831	Even if I ca n't afford LAWN ?
8181	1831	rich should pay for LAWN ?
8182	1832	I just ca n't get over how people think we are going to insure millions of ASPECT_NEW_AMERICANS and LACK is going to lower ASPECT_OVERALL_COST of healthcare .
8183	1832	LACK just lack of logic .
8184	1832	more than bunch of sheep listening to ASPECT_PEOPLE_MESSIAH .
8185	1833	Yes , and I failed to mention in I post that Dems think POST will actually reduce deficit by 131 ASPECT_BILLION over 10 ASPECT_YEARS .
8186	1833	We need to do math here .
8187	1833	Have they mentioned amount of ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE_THEY_PLAN to come up with ?
8188	1833	Not that I have heard .
8190	1834	4 TO 6 ASPECT_BILLION in ASPECT_NEW_TAXES per year , plus ASPECT_INSURANCE_PREMIUMS from EVERYBODY , or penalty for not buying , AND BEST OF 500 BILLION ASPECT_DOLLARS WILL BE ASPECT_TAKEN_FROM_MEDICARE .
8191	1834	IF is done , CBO originally said obamacare would be deficit ASPECT_NEUTRAL over 10 ASPECT_YEARS .
8192	1834	But CBO has already revised ASPECT_COST_ESTIMATE upward couple of times and program has n't even started .
8193	1834	So politicians seeking re-election year will have to publicly VOTE on higher ASPECT_TAXES year , and taxes will have to be higher than estimates .
8194	1834	So ASPECT_TAX_FUNDING is unlikely .
8195	1834	ASPECT_PREMIUMS_or penalty ASPECT_FUNDING is already being challenged in 20 different ASPECT_COURT_TESTS and WILL end up in SCOTUS .
8196	1834	And , which re-election seeking politician from party will take dime from 50 + million VOTING ASPECT_SENIORS on Medicare .
8197	1834	ai n't gonna happen .
8198	1834	So as usual ASPECT_GOVT_PROGRAM WILL cost 5 or ASPECT_TIMES more than estimated ASPECT_, -LRB- PROGRAM happens time , and ASPECT_OPPOSITE_NEVER happens -RRB- and ASPECT_TAX_FUNDING WILL fall WAY short .
8199	1834	premium or penalty ASPECT_PART will be found unconstitutional , so ZERO ASPECT_FUNDING from nonsense .
8200	1834	And ASPECT_MEDICARE_DOLLARS will never exist .
8201	1834	If not repealed in 2013 , when obama is sent back to re-organize ACORN in Chicago , `` ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE_EXPANSION_BILL will cost in excess of 5 ASPECT_TRILLION_UNFUNDED ASPECT_DOLLARS .
8202	1835	Sadly , jthorp , ASPECT_SOCIAL_CONTRACT involves both ASPECT_RIGHTS_and ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITIES .
8203	1835	Like ASPECT_CONTRACT_or ASPECT_NOT , we are part of one ASPECT_COMMUNITY , and have responsibility to make community ASPECT_WORK .
8204	1835	And ignoring needs of segment of population is one of best ASPECT_WAYS I can think of to tear community apart .
8205	1835	WE benefit from living in prosperous , peaceful ASPECT_SOCIETY .
8206	1835	Tell I , just how ASPECT_RICH would rich be if WE could n't count on lights coming on when WE flip switch , clean ASPECT_WATER coming out of tap , trash ASPECT_BEING whisked away , ASPECT_POLICE_and ASPECT_COURTS to protect WE , and so on and so on ?
8207	1835	awful ASPECT_LOT of prosperity is due to productive and ASPECT_TECHNOLOGICAL_CAPITAL that WE 've been building up for ASPECT_GENERATIONS .
8208	1835	How can of WE claim special ASPECT_RIGHT to legacy of ASPECT_WE_ANCESTORS ?
8209	1835	WE rely on RIGHT , whether WE realize RIGHT or not .
8210	1835	If you really want to just sit back and watch while people suffer and die , you 're both ASPECT_IMMORAL and fool .
8211	1835	If on bottom of ASPECT_SOCIO-ECONOMIC_LADDER are kept impoverished with precious little ASPECT_CHANCE of advancement , what ASPECT_INCENTIVE do have to buy into society ?
8212	1835	And if numbers of people stop buying into society , BOTTOM just going to fall apart .
8213	1835	BOTTOM just plain ASPECT_FLAT_OUT in best ASPECT_INTEREST of wealthy to look after lower ASPECT_CLASSES , as well as being decent and ASPECT_MORAL to do .
8214	1835	We live in extraordinarily wealthy ASPECT_SOCIETY , and WE have both ability and responsibility to care for everyone .
8215	1835	And before I hear ASPECT_USUAL_PLATITUDES about hard ASPECT_WORK and ASPECT_PERSONAL_RESPONSIBILITY ... ASPECT_PERSONAL_RESPONSIBILITY is very important .
8216	1835	So is collective ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY .
8217	1835	ASPECT_WE_IGNORE either at ASPECT_WE_PERIL .
8218	1835	And as admirable and ASPECT_NECESSARY as hard ASPECT_WORK is , saying that of society ills would be solved if everyone would work hard enough is naive .
8219	1835	If PERIL takes is hard ASPECT_WORK to reach pinnacle of society , why is poor ?
8220	1835	fact is that not that people manage to move really dramatically on ASPECT_SOCIO-ECONOMIC_SCALE .
8222	1836	I will be for Chamber of Commerce , who promotes small ASPECT_BUSINESS_and ASPECT_HIRING !
8224	1838	At what ASPECT_POINT is your wholly imaginary `` ASPECT_SOCIAL_RESPONSIBILITY met ?
8225	1838	Today top ASPECT_25 of wealth pays 86.6 of ASPECT_INCOME_TAX and 27 pays remaining ASPECT_13.4 of ASPECT_INCOME_TAX .
8226	1838	Leaving 47 of nation TAKES out , rather than paying IN anything .
8227	1838	have fiscal ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY to fund operations of Govt .
8228	1838	do not have ASPECT_SOCIAL_RESPONSIBILITY to support will not support themselves .
8229	1838	CHARITY is there for , Charity is means for wish to exercise imagined `` ASPECT_SOCIAL_RESPONSIBILITY .
8230	1838	And charity is encouraged through ASPECT_TAX_DEDUCTIBLITY .
8231	1838	If you want charity , work for charitable ASPECT_TAX_DEDUCTIONS .
8232	1838	What came first , chicken or egg ?
8233	1838	of what you cite above is ASPECT_DIRECT_RESULT of PERSON deciding to INVEST , at great ASPECT_PERSONAL_RISK to , time , ideas , brainpower , future , and money .
8234	1838	Part of decision might have been genius , or ASPECT_SIMPLE_DESIRE to improve , but part was also for ASPECT_PERSONAL_GAIN .
8235	1838	`` poor ASPECT_BENEFIT from accomplishments in ASPECT_TECHNOLOGY_and ASPECT_PRODUCTIVITY .
8236	1838	Is BENEFIT too much to ask that investor made BENEFIT ASPECT_POSSIBLE , enjoy lion share of accomplishments without being vilified ?
8237	1838	`` Suffer and ASPECT_DIE ?????????
8238	1838	is next to non-existent in USA .
8239	1838	`` ASPECT_POOR are families of 4 making 22,000.00 per ASPECT_YEAR_or ASPECT_LESS and `` ASPECT_RICH are making 200,000.00 ASPECT_OR per year .
8240	1838	Both ASPECT_POLITICAL_ARBITRARY ASPECT_NUMBERS .
8241	1838	Based solely on vote ASPECT_BUYING , not ASPECT_REALITY .
8242	1838	BOTH `` ASPECT_POOR have homes , cars , ASPECT_MULTIPLE_TV , cell ASPECT_PHONES , designer ASPECT_CLOTHES , ASPECT_OVERNOURISHED_BODIES , and free education ASPECT_AVAILABLE .
8243	1838	While 80 of BOTH `` ASPECT_RICH , make under 500,000.00 and are ASPECT_PRIMARY_SOURCE of small ASPECT_BUSINESS_JOB_CREATION .

8245	1838	Hard work and ASPECT_PERSONAL_RESPONSIBILITY are not `` platitudes .

8252	1838	And idea and goal .
8253	1838	poor have little of of AND for part , DO ASPECT_NOT_WORK hard .
8254	1838	When starting out in ASPECT_BUSINESS , I worked harder , longer , and hopefully smarter than employee I had .
8255	1838	And less ASPECT_MONEY , and sometimes NO ASPECT_MONEY , went in I pocket , while employees did get paid .
8256	1838	All ASPECT_WHILE_NOT KNOWING , but taking chance , that what I was doing WOULD be successful .
8257	1838	Now retired , over course of I working life I 've provided jobs , GOOD ASPECT_JOBS , for over 1000 ASPECT_PEOPLE .
8258	1838	But never for minute did I hesitate to fire trying to ` coast ' through job .
8259	1838	country became successful because we have had ASPECT_EQUAL_OPPORTUNITY to try to become successful .
8260	1838	in ASPECT_WE_HISTORY , until liberalism , ever said everyone has ASPECT_EQUAL_RIGHT to share in ASPECT_OTHERS_SUCCESS .
8261	1841	ASPECT_BASIC_HEALTH_and ASPECT_SAFETY_IS right we provide in ASPECT_VARIOUS_WAYS in country , including police and ASPECT_FIRE_DEPARTMENTS !
8262	1841	Why is RIGHT ASPECT_SUDDENLY wrong to provide ASPECT_HEALTH_and ASPECT_SAFETY in medicine , like ASPECT_DEVELOPED_NATION does .
8263	1841	People are dying and forcing ASPECT_PEOPLE_FAMILY into bankruptcy over ASPECT_MEDICAL_BILLS and you 're complaining about taxes ?
8264	1841	I do n't see how arguing your ASPECT_POSITION can call PEOPLE patriot .
8265	1841	No ASPECT_ONE should be allowed to profit off of denying ASPECT_PEOPLE_HEALTH_and ASPECT_SAFETY .
8266	1841	's as simple as ONE gets .
8267	1841	ASPECT_FOOD_COMPANIES do n't get away with ONE .
8268	1841	ASPECT_DRUG_COMPANIES do n't get away with ONE .
8269	1841	And ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES should n't get away with ONE ASPECT_EITHER .
8270	1841	Maybe you should care less about profits of ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES and more about health and well being of your ASPECT_FELLOW_AMERICANS .
8271	1842	Your ASPECT_ARGUMENTS stand on philosophy of Bleeding ASPECT_HEART_LIBERALISM , .
8272	1842	You firmly believe in liberal ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY , Good ASPECT_FER you .
8273	1842	However , as I 've said times ASPECT_BEFORE , your ASPECT_BELIEF , your ASPECT_OPINION , your ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY .
8274	1842	DOES ASPECT_NOT_CONSTITUTE FACT .
8275	1842	There are philosophies , beliefs , and opinions .
8276	1842	Just as righteous , just as provable , as yours .
8277	1842	You `` CLAIM anarchy and ASPECT_CHAOS without your ASPECT_LIBERALISM .
8278	1842	is plain and ASPECT_SIMPLE_BULLSH !
8279	1842	and is fact , not opinion .
8281	1842	As I stated , CHARITY could solve problem liberalism ASPECT_PURPORTS to solve .
8282	1842	WITHOUT enlarging Govt to point -LRB- PAST -RRB- where we can not afford ASPECT_WE_STATE_OR_FEDERAL_GOVTS .
8283	1842	GOVT should be obvious to clear ASPECT_THINKER that Government is not answer to anything .
8284	1842	Government is necessary ASPECT_DRAIN on ASPECT_WE_LIVES and ASPECT_WE_ECONOMY and DRAIN must at times be tightly controlled and minimized .
8285	1842	WE have NOT been doing that , Democrats or ASPECT_REPUBLICANS , and look at financial ASPECT_HORROR_WE are in .
8286	1842	How is that helping poor ?
8287	1842	And HORROR IS Govt fault that poor are suffering .
8288	1842	ASPECT_LIBERALS_CLAIM to be seeking answers from Govt , but in reality you 're trying to make yourself feel good using ASPECT_PEOPLES_MONEY .
8289	1842	And ASPECT_PRESENT_DAY looked at with 20\/20 ASPECT_VISION should show DAY does not and can not work .
8290	1842	And has came before give I advantage and ASPECT_HEAD_START ?
8291	1842	Yes , ABSOLUTELY ASPECT_ADVANTAGE did .
8292	1842	ADVANTAGE LAZY WORTHLESS PARASITE ASPECT_GOT AS WELL .
8293	1842	I just made of advantage instead of whining and looking for handouts .
8294	1842	And how about answer to question .
8295	1842	How is ENOUGH ?
8296	1842	With so called 25 ASPECT_&#37;_RICH now paying 86.6 of ASPECT_INCOME_TAX and your ` poor ASPECT_' and remaining ASPECT_47 of ASPECT_PUBLIC_PAYING .
8297	1842	Should rich ASPECT_PAY_99.999 ?
8298	1842	And if you think that , I can tell you that liberals would want .
8299	1843	I 'm sorry , I thought it was obvious that we 're discussing philosophy at point .
8300	1843	And I \*\* never \*\* claimed to be righteous .
8301	1843	I am not , never have been , and never will be righteous .
8302	1843	I have no special ASPECT_INSIGHT , no divine ASPECT_INSPIRATION , no special ASPECT_CONNECTION to absolute ASPECT_TRUTH .
8303	1843	And I most certainly do not have answers .
8304	1843	I 'm just one ASPECT_FALLIBLE_PERSON doing I best to figure things out and maybe contribute little to making community bit better .
8305	1843	If I 'm wrong , then show I .
8306	1843	Show I where I 'm wrong , give I convincing ASPECT_ARGUMENT , or show I evidence , and I 'll change I mind if MIND measures up .
8307	1843	But do n't expect I to take you seriously if you have is `` cause YOU say so .
8308	1843	`` Chaos and ASPECT_ANARCHY are very ASPECT_POSSIBILITIES when people at top of ASPECT_SOCIO-ECONOMIC_LADDER neglect farther down .
8309	1843	History is full of examples of ASPECT_REVOLTS_and ASPECT_REVOLUTIONS when people are pushed too far .
8310	1843	And even ASPECT_EXAMPLES of great ASPECT_CIVILIZATIONS falling into darkness when ASPECT_PEOPLE_LEADERSHIP neglects big ASPECT_PICTURE .
8311	1843	From ASPECT_INTERMEDIATE_PERIOD of Ancient ASPECT_EGYPT to ASPECT_RUSSIAN_REVOLUTION of 1917 , chaos and ASPECT_ANARCHY is specter that society has always lived with .
8312	1843	And if let things fall apart , PERIOD can \* happen here .
8313	1843	US is subject to forces as nation in world history .
8314	1843	If wish to avoid fate of so of predecessors , need to learn from examples , both what did right and what did wrong .
8315	1843	As crucial as FATE is to safeguard rights of ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_, ASPECT_NEED to keep eye on big ASPECT_PICTURE , too .
8316	1843	Neither can be neglected if want grand ASPECT_EXPERIMENT call ASPECT_UNITED_STATES to succeed in term .
8317	1843	Tell I , why do you think ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_assistance ASPECT_PROGRAMS were instituted in place ?
8318	1843	Because ASPECT_PRIVATE_CHARITIES simply were n't getting job done .
8319	1843	Government is not inherently evil , then ASPECT_SOCIAL_INSTITUTION .
8320	1843	JOB is simply ASPECT_TOOL , and whether JOB does good or ill depends entirely on how JOB used .
8321	1843	Do YOU honestly believe that poverty -LRB- as ASPECT_RELATIVE_TERM as is -RRB- exists solely because who are n't rich are `` lazy worthless ASPECT_PARASITES ?
8322	1843	You see poverty as only being ASPECT_PERSONAL_moral ASPECT_FAILING ?
8323	1843	Then why in world is poverty ASPECT_STILL ASPECT_SOCIAL_ISSUE ?
8324	1843	Do you think WORLD fun being poor ?
8325	1843	Do you think that living on ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_BENEFITS gives you luxurious ASPECT_LIFESTYLE ?
8326	1843	Then you need serious ASPECT_REALITY_CHECK , I friend .
8327	1843	I assure you that none of is even remotely true .
8328	1843	And generally speaking , poor ASPECT_DEFINITELY do not use benefits to buy designer ASPECT_CLOTHES .
8329	1843	Paying ASPECT_BASIC_BILLS is enough of challenge , I promise you .
8330	1843	How is enough ?
8331	1843	There is never firm ASPECT_ANSWER to .
8332	1843	ANSWER that we as community must decide through ASPECT_POLITICAL_PROCESS , through consensus and ASPECT_COMPROMISE , through actually listening to .
8333	1843	What ASPECT_WE_NEED are practical , ASPECT_PRAGMATIC_PEOPLE from over ASPECT_POLITICAL_SPECTRUM to talk , to give ASPECT_WE_PEOPLE_POINTS of view , to make suggestions , to be as forceful ASPECT_ADVOCATE for ASPECT_PEOPLE_POSITIONS as possible .
8334	1843	ASPECT_WE_NEED to take best that of WE has to offer , even ASPECT_PARTS that you do n't agree with .
8335	1843	But WE need serious ASPECT_IDEAS , not , `` do n't want to pay taxes , not , `` But why should have to so something about SPECTRUM ?
8336	1843	not , `` Hey , man , JOB not ASPECT_JOB .
8337	1844	revolts in past have been against `` power being used to stop ASPECT_INDIVIDUALISM_and ASPECT_FREEDOM .
8338	1844	Pretty much what ASPECT_LIBERALISM is trying to do now .
8339	1844	There have been NO ASPECT_REVOLTS in history against free ASPECT_MARKET .
8340	1844	Right now LIBERALS in Europe are revolting , striking , and looting and destroying , and even KILLING because fiscal ASPECT_MESS can not be supported longer and ASPECT_LIBERALS are losing ASPECT_TINY_BIT of ASPECT_LIBERALS_FREEBIES .
8341	1844	And for LIBERALS are willing to kill .
8342	1844	is LIBERALS willing to kill to keep ASPECT_LIBERALS_unsustainable ASPECT_GIVEAWAY_PROGRAMS .
8343	1844	You can not SEE danger there ?????
8344	1844	Conservatives are trying to say and have said for years , `` Let ASPECT_YEARS_NOT follow Europe , let Europe follow CONSERVATIVES .
8345	1844	But liberals insisted that we follow Europe .
8346	1844	Can you not see where ends .
8347	1844	Bankrupt ASPECT_COUNTRIES , fiscally AND morally bankrupt under guise of doing good ASPECT_AND being ` compassionate .
8348	1844	You ask for proof , you ask I make good ASPECT_ARGUMENT against liberalism , Simple , EUROPE !
8349	1844	Europe should be little ASPECT_KID tagging along behind and trying to get big ASPECT_KIDS to play with KIDS .
8350	1844	Instead , if we do not change ASPECT_WE_WAYS , Europe is showing ASPECT_WE_WE_bleak ASPECT_FUTURE .
8351	1844	ENABLING people to BE poor is what ASPECT_LIBERALISM does .
8352	1844	EUROPE does to ennoble people EUROPE only enables PEOPLE .
8353	1844	Liberals say that placing ASPECT_DEMANDS on poor is demeaning POOR .
8354	1844	is opposite of truth .
8355	1844	MAKE ASPECT_LIBERALS earn everything , and LIBERALS will find ambition , pride , ASPECT_SELF_ESTEEM , and drive .
8356	1844	And ASPECT_PERSONAL_RESPONSIBILITY .
8357	1844	If we can afford to give to poor , ASPECT_WE can afford to make work for POOR to do instead .
8358	1844	And your ASPECT_CLAIM that charity was not doing job is completely fallacious .
8359	1844	No ASPECT_GIVEAWAY_PROGRAMS were started to make up charitable ASPECT_SHORTFALL .
8360	1844	ASPECT_GIVEAWAY_PROGRAMS have one ASPECT_PURPOSE and one ASPECT_PURPOSE only .
8361	1844	And is not to help poor , ASPECT_PURPOSE is to help politician buy votes .
8362	1844	And NO ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE is saying , `` NO do n't want to pay taxes .
8363	1844	We are saying , `` POOR ASPECT_REFUSE to pay even ASPECT_TAXES until Govt stops wasting 50 ASPECT_CENTS of ASPECT_TAX_DOLLAR_POOR ASPECT_PAY now .
8364	1845	Why on earth would we pay for permanent ASPECT_JOBS for poor ASPECT_?!
8365	1845	Assistance is only supposed to be temporary .
8366	1845	ASPECT_PROVIDING_JOBS just for sake of providing jobs has potential to be lifelong ASPECT_COMMITMENT !
8367	1845	SAKE would cost money for about ASPECT_AMOUNT of benefit !
8368	1845	ASPECT_JOBS_GOVERNMENT should be creating for sake of improving economy is ASPECT_TEMPORARY_JOBS .
8369	1845	And they should only be creating in times of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_SLOWDOWN .
8370	1845	We do n't want to set WE up for bunch of ASPECT_LIFE_COMMITMENTS unless BUNCH going to seriously improve ASPECT_WE_ECONOMY .
8371	1845	ASPECT_TEMPORARY_ASSISTANCE is poor ASPECT_PEOPLE need .
8372	1845	people on welfare get off ASPECT_BUNCH within years because PEOPLE are able to find ASPECT_JOB_and support ASPECT_PEOPLE_FAMILY .
8373	1845	Welfare helps poor get back to work .
8374	1846	`` WELFARE ASPECT_HELPS POOR ASPECT_GET_BACK TO WORK !
8375	1846	`` HOW ???
8376	1846	There is temporary about ASPECT_GIVEAWAY_PROGRAMS we have for poor .
8377	1846	changes to ASPECT_GIVEAWAY_PROGRAMS is POOR get increased .
8378	1847	FACT fact that average welfare ASPECT_FAMILY only stays on welfare for years that .
8379	1847	welfare ASPECT_LIFE is not life of luxury .
8380	1847	People want to get off ASPECT_LIFE as soon as possible .
8381	1847	And welfare does help people get back to work in LIFE keeps demand up in recessions which causes businesses to hire again ASPECT_SOONER .
8382	1847	In ASPECT_END_WELFARE saves us money than ASPECT_END_COSTS because welfare is recession ASPECT_BUSTER .
8383	1847	Want to end recession quickly and effectively ?
8384	1847	Increase foodstamps and extend welfare ASPECT_BENEFITS .
8385	1848	And pass costs on to INFINITY ?
8386	1848	2 ASPECT_THINGS wrong with your `` ASPECT_PLAN .
8387	1848	`` 1 .
8388	1848	1 does n't work2 .
8389	1848	YOUR can not afford 1 .
8390	1848	Govt is no different than you and I. If YOUR keep running out of money before end of year , ASPECT_YOUR_KNOW ASPECT_YOUR have to CHANGE what YOUR 've been doing .
8391	1848	And since , like Govt , YOUR can only marginally increase ASPECT_YOUR_REVENUE , YOUR must stop ASPECT_YOUR_OUTFLOW .
8392	1848	is not painless or welcome to individual or Govt .
8393	1848	Things can not be avoided and MUST be done are seldom relished .
8394	1848	But still must be done .
8395	1848	There is NO alternative ASPECT_CHOICE except for things to get worse and ASPECT_WORSE until collapse !
8396	1849	Welfare has already been proven to work .
8397	1849	Hence why WELFARE been around for 80 ASPECT_YEARS .
8398	1849	Hence why ASPECT_ECONOMIC_SCHOOL teaches that extension of welfare ASPECT_BENEFITS is ASPECT_ECONOMIC_STIMULUS .
8399	1849	Back before republicans went crazy stupid ASPECT_REPUBLICANS knew fact as well .
8400	1849	Extention of welfare in bad ASPECT_TIMES used to be bipartisan because everyone who knew anything about economics knows welfare ASPECT_BENEFITS economy like ASPECT_SCHOOL_CHILD knows earth rotates around sun .
8401	1849	Just because you do n't understand how EXTENTION works does n't mean EXTENTION does n't work .
8402	1849	We are n't running out of money because welfare ASPECT_COSTS too much .
8403	1849	WE 're running out of money because ASPECT_WE_TAXES have been way too low for about 30 ASPECT_YEARS now .
8404	1849	Since Reagan cut them .
8405	1849	Conservatives would rather see more in ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_PAYCHECK then see country where people do not starve to death or die of ASPECT_CURABLE_DISEASE simply because PEOPLE could n't afford ASPECT_FOOD_and ASPECT_MEDICINE .
8406	1849	And CONSERVATIVES think CONSERVATIVES are following Jesus in doing so .
8407	1849	What joke .
8408	1850	Welfare did start under liberal ASPECT_PRESIDENT in 1930 .
8409	1850	WELFARE worked so well that Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION ended shortly after end of WWII in ASPECT_LATER_1940 .
8410	1850	Way to go !
8411	1850	Tax , Spend , Tax , Spend , Hup , Hoop , hreep , harr , Tax , Spend , Tax , Spend , Hup , Hoop , hreep , harr , Tax , Spend , Tax , Spend , Hup , Hoop , hreep , harr ,
8412	1851	Like YOU said .
8413	1851	YOU want YOU lawn cared for .
8414	1851	Are you going to help pay for LAWN ?
8415	1851	You know , since you are `` ASPECT_PATRIOT .
8416	1853	What does ASPECT_LAWN_CARE have to do with ASPECT_HEALTH_and ASPECT_SAFETY ?
8417	1853	We 're talking about people dieing of ASPECT_CURABLE_DISEASE .
8418	1853	's not at comparable .
8419	1854	Because I 'm going to get depressed if I lawn does n't look good .
8420	1854	Nobody dies from preventable ASPECT_DISEASE in America , nobody is denied healthcare already .
8421	1855	Here 's ASPECT_FACT_or ASPECT_2 .
8422	1855	LIBERAL are liberal .
8423	1855	Sadly , around ASPECT_20 of Americans still are liberals .
8424	1855	And you just played ASPECT_RACE_CARD against opponent .
8425	1855	Not because your ASPECT_OPPONENT is racist , but because CARD your ASPECT_KOOL-AID_PURVEYORS have taught you to do .
8426	1856	Your 2 ASPECT_PARAS are liberal ASPECT_DREAMING of perfect ASPECT_WORLD that ASPECT_WILL_NOT happen .
8427	1856	had 50 ASPECT_YEARS to happen in Medicare so far and has not happened ever .
8428	1856	Politicians from both ASPECT_PARTIES claiming THEY will stop Medicare , -LRB- ASPECT_INSURANCE -RRB- and Medicaid -LRB- welfare -RRB- fraud are old , old ASPECT_NEWS .
8429	1856	NONE has money to show for ASPECT_POLITICIANS_PROMISES .
8430	1856	And 500 ASPECT_BILLION is silliest ASPECT_CLAIM_EVER made .
8431	1856	And EVER wo n't happen
8432	1857	Bull -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_PEOPLE do n't die .
8433	1857	CHOICE hard ASPECT_CHOICE to put your ASPECT_FAMILY through tens of thousands in debt or just die quiet ASPECT_DEATH and leave your ASPECT_FAMILY_DEBT free .
8434	1857	lot of Americans choose latter .
8435	1857	People do die from ASPECT_TREATABLE_DISEASES .
8436	1857	You are completely out of touch if you believe otherwise .
8437	1857	LOT 's not as easy as simply going to emergency ASPECT_ROOM .
8438	1857	LOT paying for ASPECT_LOT_AFTERWARDS 's problem .
8439	1857	And no ASPECT_BODY should be forced to put family into debt to survive .
8440	1857	Civilized ASPECT_SOCIETIES do not do that to civilians .
8441	1857	America is ASPECT_DEVELOPED_NATION does .
8442	1857	And AMERICA because there are too ASPECT_PEOPLE in country would prefer to see ASPECT_EXTRA_DOLLARS in CIVILIANS paycheck then see country where no ASPECT_ONE has to choose between death and supporting ASPECT_CIVILIANS_FAMILY .
8446	1858	It 's not ASPECT_ONE or .
8447	1858	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE is expensive , MONEY 's not ASPECT_EXTRA_DOLLARS .
8448	1858	MONEY ASPECT_LOT_MONEY , through ASPECT_TAXES_and ASPECT_INSURANCE .
8449	1858	MONEY worse ASPECT_HEALTHCARE for people paying for healthcare .
8450	1858	MONEY free ASPECT_HEALTHCARE for people who contribute .
8451	1858	You ca n't provide source for your radical ASPECT_CLAIMS_MONEY ridiculous .
8452	1858	ASPECT_REASON_DOCTOR_COSTS are so high is because of idiots that try to sue hospital ASPECT_TIME_NATURAL happens .
8453	1858	people -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_ING are n't ones paying .
8454	1858	ING quite typical .
8455	1858	ASPECT_SOCIALIZED_HEALTHCARE is so great ... not .
8456	1858	What ASPECT_TREATABLE_DISEASE poor ASPECT_PERSON typically dies from ?
8457	1858	There is n't .
8458	1858	's whole ASPECT_POINT of insurance , you know to insure yourself from being in position to choose between outrageous ASPECT_PRICES and not getting healthcare .
8459	1858	DISEASE 's way for anything else .
8460	1858	If I do n't buy home ASPECT_INSURANCE and I ASPECT_HOUSE_BURNS down ... what happens ?
8461	1858	Everyone should be entitled to ASPECT_BASIC_HEALTH_CARE like they already are , but to suggest that everyone needs to go to doctor for ASPECT_ROUTINE_COLD on ASPECT_TAXPAYERS_MONEY is asinine .
8462	1859	Absolutely wrong .
8463	1859	If your ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE wo n't cover INSURANCE , and you do n't have money , , ASPECT_DISEASES will not get treated , and you get to die .
8464	1859	While it is true that if you are without insurance you can go to emergency ASPECT_ROOM for treatment , does n't mean you can automatically get whatever ASPECT_TREATMENT is necessary .
8465	1859	ROOM does n't mean you get ASPECT_KIDNEY_TRANSPLANT if you ca n't afford one .
8466	1859	People die in America for lack of insurance .
8467	1859	People die in America from lack of access to ASPECT_MEDICAL_CARE .
8468	1859	America has best ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_MONEY can buy .
8469	1859	But not if you ca n't buy AMERICA .
8470	1861	Still provided no ASPECT_SOURCES other than your ASPECT_OPINION .
8471	1863	Tell to 150000 innocent dead ASPECT_IRAQIS .
8472	1863	LOL You wish Jollee .
8473	1864	How do you know your ASPECT_FIGURES are correct ?
8474	1864	In fact how do you know they were innocent ?
8475	1864	I did not approve of ASPECT_IRAQ_2 , but I did not have information that authorities did either -LRB- for reason to go to ASPECT_WAR_-RRB- .
8476	1864	Oh I am sure numbers of dead are high .
8477	1864	However , you seem to have need to be so ASPECT_ONE sided on issue .
8478	1864	Hey I am just wondering , how people did ASPECT_SADDAM_and ASPECT_SADDAM_SADDAM_TORTURE and kill in ASPECT_UNDERGROUND_CHAMBERS ?
8479	1864	I suppose Megadeath you condone ?
8480	1864	Truly I do not think that you condone Saddam torturous ASPECT_REIGN , correct ?
8481	1864	Then would you not agree that REIGN was good brave ASPECT_SOLDIERS ended up getting rid of SADDAM and at least ASPECT_HUNDREDS of his ASPECT_SECRET_death ASPECT_SQUAD_POLICE ?
8482	1864	Do n't you understand that USA is not country makes moral ASPECT_MISTAKES ?
8483	1864	For example , is your ASPECT_COUNTRY free of killing innocents ?
8484	1864	What about treatment of Aboriginals ?
8485	1864	On and threads you seem fixated on belittling USA and her ASPECT_PEOPLE but turn blind ASPECT_EYE to your ASPECT_COUNTRIES_ATROCITIES eh ?
8486	1864	Hey take stick or ASPECT_CROW_BAR and pry eye open !
8487	1864	You are missing so ASPECT_STUFF !
8488	1864	Oh for further ASPECT_READING of side of soiled Australian ASPECT_COIN ~ Racist ASPECT_AUSTRALIA - ASPECT_GENOCIDAL_Atrocities ASPECT_OVERVIEWHTTP : ASPECT_\/_\/ www.treatyrepublic.net\/node\/66Maybe if ASPECT_OVERVIEWHTTP_COUNTRIES_ATROCITIES are exposed OVERVIEWHTTP will shut up about ASPECT_COUNTRIES_MISTAKES , God knows OUR make mistakes , well of do ~ ?
8490	1866	Your ASPECT_POLL is missing `` depends `` as in , ASPECT_YOUR_VOTE will depend upon candidates ... YOUR am not particularly happy with Obama , but GOP will have to put up `` ASPECT_ELECTABLE_CANDIDATE to get my ASPECT_VOTE .
8491	1866	MY would vote for Obama over ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , but Mitt ASPECT_ROMNEY_MY would consider .
8492	1866	would vote for GOP or ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY without considering candidates are running is letting others make up ASPECT_OTHERS_MIND .
8493	1866	MY would love to see like ASPECT_RON_PAUL to get chance .
8494	1866	MY admit is little ASPECT_RIGID in beliefs , and CANDIDATES are not necessarily popular with lot of people .
8495	1866	But if you listen to SOMEONE , logic is sound .
8496	1868	LOL you claim I do n't provide sources then you make ASPECT_REDICULIOUS_CLAIM that ASPECT_REASON_HEALTHCARE_COSTS are high is because of legal ASPECT_COSTS .
8497	1868	's absolutely ridiculous .
8498	1868	And I will cite one : ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WASHINGTONINDEPENDENT.COM\/634...PENDING-BY-0-2THE_CBO estimated that .5 ASPECT_&#37;_SAVINGS would come out of ASPECT_TORT_REFORM .
8499	1868	And .2 of .5 would come from people being less likely to use ASPECT_MEDICAL_SERVICES .
8500	1868	In words because of fact that ASPECT_TORT_REFORM has already passed in states , ASPECT_NATIONWIDE_TORT_REFORM would do next to in terms of ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_SAVINGS .
8501	1868	Are you really daft ?
8502	1868	People die from ASPECT_TREATABLE_CANCERS all time because PEOPLE do n't have insurance to cover ASPECT_REGULAR_CHECKUPS .
8503	1868	Sure you can go to emergency ASPECT_ROOM after you 're pissing blood .
8504	1868	But by then you 're already dead .
8506	1868	And if your ASPECT_JOB lets you go because you have cancer and ca n't work anymore and you lose your ASPECT_EMPLOYERS healthcare good ASPECT_LUCK getting ASPECT_NEW_INSURANCE_PLAN .
8507	1868	ASPECT_BASIC_HEALTHCARE is ability to get ASPECT_REGULAR_CHECKUPS .
8508	1868	And no ASPECT_CHECKUPS do n't have for Americans .
8509	1868	who can afford .
8510	1868	And ASPECT_REGULAR_CHECKUPS save lives .
8511	1868	You can not simply go to emergency ASPECT_ROOM and expect to survive .
8512	1868	And if you do you have just put your ASPECT_FAMILY into tens of thousands of debt .
8513	1868	If we had ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE would n't happen .
8514	1868	Why do you think people in countries with ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE live longer than WE and have better ASPECT_BIRTH_RATES than WE ?
8515	1868	You do n't think it 's sad that richest ASPECT_COUNTRY on earth has worst ASPECT_HEALTHCARE of ASPECT_DEVELOPED_NATION ?
8516	1868	Or are you one of idiots just closes ASPECT_PEOPLE_EYES_and ASPECT_PRETENDS because WE are America means WE are 1 .
8517	1869	Seriously why should my ASPECT_MONEY go to protecting ASPECT_PEOPLE who wo n't even pay ASPECT_EXTRA_DOLLARS to see everyone have free on delivery ASPECT_HEALTHCARE without ASPECT_INSURANCE_BULL -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- .
8518	1869	Sad when people defend profits of corporations over ASPECT_BASIC_HEALTH_and ASPECT_SAFETY of Americans .
8519	1869	MY do n't even understand mindset .
8520	1869	Especially when in ASPECT_END_SYSTEM cheaper ASPECT_SYSTEM for America .
8521	1869	PEOPLE 'd rather have money in ASPECT_PEOPLE_POCKETS than healthy ASPECT_COUNTRY .
8522	1869	And are so called ASPECT_PATRIOTS .
8523	1871	You cite liberal biased ASPECT_SOURCES , reinforce liberal ASPECT_POLICY .
8524	1871	Cite source like AMA .
8525	1871	YOU say things like between 2000 and 2006 17,700 uninsured ASPECT_PEOPLE died with preventable ASPECT_DISEASES .
8526	1871	Did YOU die because YOU had no ASPECT_INSURANCE ?
8527	1871	NO , YOU died because YOU did not do check ups , did not take care of YOU .
8528	1871	You and liberal ASPECT_IDIOTS will say 's because IDIOTS had no ASPECT_INSURANCE , 's why IDIOTS did not get check up .
8529	1871	Here is ASPECT_SIMPLE_FACT , not opinion , that even ASPECT_LIBERALS should be capable of understanding .
8530	1871	ASPECT_FACT_COSTS MORE to have insurance to pay for check ups than FACT would to pay for ASPECT_CHECK_UPS on .
8531	1871	Insurance IS for profit ASPECT_BUSINESS .
8532	1871	IF did not charge in premiums than ASPECT_PAY_OUT , would not be able to pay for care for anything .
8533	1871	And ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES profits are regulated by politicians .
8534	1871	So ASPECT_OBAMACARE_CHANGES nothing there except ASPECT_TRADE_STATE_POLITICIANS for ASPECT_FEDERAL_POLITICIANS .
8535	1871	And you wanna bet ASPECT_STATE_POLITICIANS keep POLITICIANS expensive ASPECT_JOBS while whole ASPECT_NEW_SET of ASPECT_FEDERAL_POLITICIANS_and ASPECT_BUREAUCRATS come on ASPECT_SCENE_and ASPECT_PAYROLL .
8536	1871	And people died for lack of caring for POLITICIANS , COULD have gone to ASPECT_PEOPLE_COUNTY ASPECT_HEALTH_SERVICE -LRB- already in place Govt ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PLAN -RRB- for ASPECT_REGULAR_MEDICAL_CARE .
8537	1871	PEOPLE would have paid for ASPECT_ROUTINE_CARE according to ASPECT_PEOPLE_INDIVIDUAL_ABILITY to pay Again ASPECT_OBAMACARE does no ASPECT_CHANGE here just adds layer of costs to already existing programs long in place .
8538	1872	You do n't pay ASPECT_TAX_MONEY .
8539	1872	You are on ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD .
8540	1872	I do n't want to hear you talk about ASPECT_TAX_MONEY .
8541	1872	If you are on ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE you do n't have right to -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- ASPECT_-RRB- about where ASPECT_TAX_MONEY is going .
8542	1873	you Think cbo is liberal biased ASPECT_SOURCE .
8543	1873	Which demonstates your ASPECT_INABILITY to determine what is and is not liberally biased .
8544	1873	To you anything that disagrees with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_world ASPECT_VIEW is liberal ASPECT_SOURCE .
8545	1873	Link please .
8546	1873	And VIEW can continue to be even after ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE .
8547	1873	There are profitable ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES in ASPECT_EUROPE_and ASPECT_CANADA .
8548	1873	Then 's just prove that for profit ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_SYSTEM is broken .
8549	1873	Which is why ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE would be better .
8550	1873	services are far too few and far too spread apart to make dent in ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_COSTS .
8551	1873	ASPECT_FORCES_INSURANCE_COMPANIES to take in preexisting ASPECT_CONDITIONS .
8552	1873	's good .
8553	1873	And if puts ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES out of business then so be .
8554	1873	Government could be doing COMPANIES job better anyway like JOB does in developed ASPECT_COUNTRY .
8555	1874	I pay hundreds of dollars year in taxes .
8556	1874	You do n't know what you 're talking about .
8557	1874	way I see YEAR who -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_ES about paying taxes should n't have right to use services paid for by taxes .
8558	1874	Get off I ASPECT_ROADS .
8559	1874	Quit calling cops .
8560	1874	And do n't expect firemen to put out your ASPECT_FIRES and do n't send your ASPECT_KIDS to ASPECT_PUBLIC_SCHOOLS .
8561	1874	In fact why do n't you just go to ASPECT_REMOTE_ISLAND and start your ASPECT_TAX_free ASPECT_NATION .
8562	1876	who buys into ABSOLUTE illogical ASPECT_NONSENSE that ASPECT_HIGH_INSURANCE_PREMIUMS -LRB- true ASPECT_-RRB- will be cured by vastly increasing ASPECT_INSURANCE_COVERAGE is certifiable .
8563	1876	NONSENSE just WILL NOT come to pass .
8564	1876	obummercare will turn out to be ASPECT_MASSIVE_INCREASE in ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_AND ASPECT_INSURANCE_COSTS in history , if not repealed by rational thinking ASPECT_PEOPLE .
8566	1877	You do n't like offer I made you , jthorpe ?
8567	1877	Why ever not ?
8568	1877	You would n't have to pay for lazy ASPECT_PARASITES out there .
8569	1877	is just so typical .
8570	1877	people who complain loudest about paying taxes do n't think twice about using what taxes pay for .
8571	1877	Tell I , who are parasites here ?
8572	1877	I wonder how ASPECT_TEA_PARTIERS get ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY_BENEFITS ?
8573	1877	Face ASPECT_LOUDEST , jthorpe , you make use of what government does for us as everyone else .
8574	1877	Quit whining and try acting like responsible ASPECT_ADULT .
8575	1878	`` how ASPECT_TEA_PARTIERS get ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY_BENEFITS ?
8576	1878	`` ANSWER : NONE , have not paid ASPECT_FICA_TAXES for minimum of 40 ASPECT_QUARTERS -LRB- 10 ASPECT_YEARS -RRB- and have attained age of 62 ASPECT_YEARS for ASPECT_PARTIAL_PAYMENTS or now 68 ASPECT_OR so years for ASPECT_FULL_BENEFITS .
8577	1878	better ASPECT_QUESTION : How parasites are receiving ASPECT_FOOD_STAMPS , ASPECT_HOUSING_SUBSIDIES , welfare , ADC , WIC , Medicaid , and ASPECT_TAX_REBATES , when PARTIERS have not paid cent of taxes in years .
8578	1878	Maybe in ASPECT_PARTIERS_whole ASPECT_LIVES ?
8579	1880	Here xxxxxx is research for you .
8580	1880	Sorry you are unwilling or unable to find truth .
8581	1880	woman with cancer , 1 .
8582	1880	is one ASPECT_SIDE of story .
8583	1880	And 2 .
8584	1880	No ASPECT_MATTER , policy had to be within 2 ASPECT_YEARS of issue or insurer was stuck with POLICY .
8585	1880	HIPAAHIPAA is ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE_PORTABILITY and ASPECT_ACCOUNTABILITY_ACT of 1996 .
8586	1880	PORTABILITY limits ASPECT_INSURERS_POWER to deny or delay claims , reduces your ASPECT_CHANCES of losing existing ASPECT_COVERAGE , makes ASPECT_PORTABILITY_easier and less ASPECT_RISKY to switch ASPECT_HEALTH_PLANS , and prohibits ASPECT_INSURANCE_DISCRIMINATION based on ASPECT_HEALTH_PROBLEMS .
8587	1880	ASPECT_HIPAA_PROTECTIONS Non-Discrimination In ASPECT_GROUP_PLAN , insurer may not apply different ASPECT_ELIGIBILITY_RULES , offer different ASPECT_BENEFITS , or charge higher ASPECT_PREMIUM to individual on basis of ASPECT_CERTAIN_HEALTH_FACTORS_HEALTH_STATUS , ASPECT_CLAIMS_EXPERIENCE , ASPECT_MEDICAL_HISTORY or ASPECT_GENETIC_INFORMATION .
8588	1880	Guaranteed Issue ASPECT_INSURERS providing small ASPECT_GROUP_COVERAGE must offer coverage to small ASPECT_EMPLOYER applies , regardless of ASPECT_HEALTH_STATUS or prior claims experience of employees .
8589	1880	Guaranteed ASPECT_RENEWABILITY_INSURERS may not cancel ASPECT_HEALTH_PLAN unless beneficiary fails to pay premiums or insurer stops doing business in market .
8590	1880	Limits on Preexisting ASPECT_CONDITION_EXCLUSIONS_INSURERS may not exclude -LRB- refuse to cover -RRB- ASPECT_TREATMENTS_and ASPECT_SERVICES related to ASPECT_MEDICAL_CONDITIONS existed before beneficiary purchased ASPECT_HEALTH_PLAN for period ofmore than 12 ASPECT_MONTHS .
8591	1880	If person has had continuous ASPECT_COVERAGE prior to purchasing ASPECT_NEW_PLAN there can be no coverage ASPECT_EXCLUSIONS .
8592	1880	ASPECT_STATE_Consumer ASPECT_PROTECTIONSSTATES provide variety of important ASPECT_PROTECTIONS through ASPECT_STATE_LAW .
8593	1880	may include : appeal of coverage ASPECT_DECISIONS within ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY ; appeal of coverage ASPECT_DECISIONS to impartial ASPECT_EXTERNAL_REVIEWER ; prompt ASPECT_PAYMENT of claims ; access to ASPECT_CERTAIN_SPECIALISTS_and ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PROVIDERS ; coverage of ASPECT_SPECIFIC_TREATMENTS_and ASPECT_SERVICES ; and .
8594	1880	state has ASPECT_INSURANCE_DEPARTMENT is ready to help you with question or complaint you may have about your ASPECT_COVERAGE .
8595	1880	To find out , ASPECT_CONTACT your ASPECT_STATE_INSURANCE_DEPARTMENT .
8596	1880	KNOWLEDGE IS POWER , WEAKLING 're weakling .
8597	1881	's just swell , until person loses job and then with ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_COVERAGE with JOB and ca n't find ASPECT_NEW_EMPLOYMENT with ASPECT_HEALTH_COVERAGE until pre-existing limitations ASPECT_PERIOD expires .
8598	1882	You do know that ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE can be purchased independently from your ASPECT_EMPLOYER_, ASPECT_RIGHT ?
8599	1883	They now have rights to continue coverage under Cobra .
8600	1883	But who just lost ASPECT_THEY_JOB ca n't often afford ASPECT_COBRA_INSURANCE_RATES , which are usually mulitples higher than what MULITPLES paid when employer because employer often pays for or of it .
8601	1883	So THEY lose ASPECT_THEY_INSURANCE , and if THEY do n't get ASPECT_REPLACEMENT_INSURANCE within short ASPECT_PERIOD of time THEY can get screwed by pre-existing .
8602	1884	No , you buy your ASPECT_INSURANCE and opt out of your ASPECT_EMPLOYER plan .
8603	1884	way you keep your ASPECT_INSURANCE before , during , and after your ASPECT_EMPLOYMENT .
8604	1884	Once Republicans ASPECT_DISMANTLE_OBAMACARE and allow ASPECT_INSURANCE_POLICIES to be marketed across ASPECT_STATE_LINES , bringing in competition to mix , then rates will fall .
8605	1884	Be ASPECT_PATIENT ...
8606	1886	Actually , allowing ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES to sell across ASPECT_STATE_LINES would have ASPECT_OPPOSITE_EFFECT .
8607	1886	Because ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE_COMPANIES will all do ASPECT_CREDIT_card ASPECT_COMPANIES have done - move to state with least ASPECT_REGULATIONS_and fewest consumer ASPECT_PROTECTIONS .
8608	1886	Considering that ASPECT_STATES_PLACE no ASPECT_RESTRICTIONS at on ASPECT_POLICY_PREMIUMS or ASPECT_RATE_INCREASES , somehow I doubt NO 're going to reduce NO ASPECT_RATES out of goodness of NO ASPECT_HEARTS .
8609	1887	Wonderful ASPECT_IDEA .
8610	1887	For small ASPECT_PERCENTAGE who lose job and still can afford to pay for insurance on .
8611	1887	Everyone is screwed .
8612	1887	Republicans had 6 ASPECT_YEARS of complete ASPECT_CONTROL of Govt and did n't do -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- , except ASPECT_CUT_TAXES which help folks who do n't need YEARS .
8613	1888	You pay hundreds of dollars of taxes ?
8614	1888	I 'm not talking about ASPECT_SALES_TAX .
8615	1888	You have stated that you only work during summer because you ca n't handle working and going to college during ASPECT_SCHOOL_YEAR .
8616	1888	I remember summer you were complaining that you could n't find job ... which is BS .
8617	1888	So , you are n't paying hundreds of dollars in taxes .
8618	1888	People who pay taxes can -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ONES want about ONES .
8619	1888	ONES are ones paying for ASPECT_YOUR_FOOD because YOU are too lazy to work and your ASPECT_MOOCHER so you wo n't take out small ASPECT_LOAN .
8620	1888	Why do n't you stop mooching off taxpayer and then we will listen to your ASPECT_IDEAS .
8621	1888	You have talked about how you can buy steak with your ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD which is freaking ASPECT_JOKE .
8622	1888	People like you are ones hurting economy .
8624	1889	Why do n't you listen to Obama .
8625	1889	OBAMA has now admitted ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL is n't reducing anything .
8626	1889	You ca n't insure people and have price go down .
8627	1889	is ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE .
8628	1889	PRICE was just another liberal ASPECT_LIE about ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE ... get over PRICE !
8629	1891	But if ASPECT_OVERALL_COST goes up marginally ASPECT_LESS per ASPECT_CAPITA_COSTS_DECREASE .
8630	1891	Plus you do n't have cost of relying on emergency ASPECT_ROOMS for ASPECT_PRIMARY_CARE .
8631	1892	lot of folks seem to think big ASPECT_FONTS make impressive ASPECT_ARGUMENTS .
8632	1892	Really smart ASPECT_ONES put LOT in color .
8633	1893	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE is not right .
8634	1893	4 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , strong ASPECT_GDP_GROWTH , and deficit is third of what UNEMPLOYMENT is now .
8635	1893	Ahh , good old ASPECT_DAYS ... before Obama drove America into ditch .
8636	1894	It is if we make IT one .
8637	1894	Should be , IMO .
8638	1894	of WE would n't call -7 ASPECT_GROWTH `` strong .
8639	1895	-LRB- covers my ASPECT_EARS -RRB- ASPECT_MY_GOODNESS , jthorpe , shouting at top of your ASPECT_LUNGS has made your ASPECT_ARGUMENT ever so much more credible .
8640	1895	GOODNESS makes you sound so calm , rational , and well informed .
8641	1895	And GOODNESS 'll make everyone not notice that YOU provided no ASPECT_EVIDENCE_or ASPECT_REFERENCES , did not actually address anything ASPECT_MY said , and what you did say is incoherent , and does n't actually work out to be criticism of ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_LAW at all .
8642	1895	Of course amount spent on ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE has n't gone down .
8643	1895	No ASPECT_ONE ever said ONE would .
8644	1895	Have you not been paying attention at ?
8645	1895	As MY said , ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_LAW was aimed primarily at expanding coverage and reforming ASPECT_INSURANCE_REGULATION .
8646	1895	LAW has ASPECT_SEVERAL_MEASURES aimed at improving efficiency in ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM and works to shift focus of treatment away from expensive ASPECT_SPECIALISTS and toward preventive ASPECT_CARE_and ASPECT_GENERAL_PRACTITIONERS , of which should help contain costs in run .
8647	1895	But ASPECT_COST_CONTAINMENT is not and was never said to be ASPECT_MAIN_INTENT .
8648	1895	There are also ASPECT_SEVERAL_PILOT_PROGRAMS in law to explore ways to contain costs , but there are no easy ASPECT_ANSWERS .
8649	1895	Besides , with growing ASPECT_POPULATION , and rising ASPECT_COSTS far in excess of inflation , POPULATION would be virtually impossible to actually reduce costs .
8650	1896	No , ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE is not right .
8651	1896	Neither is having food .
8652	1896	Would make NEITHER ASPECT_OKAY to let people starve when you could easily help PEOPLE ?
8653	1896	Obama has significantly improved unemployment and ASPECT_GDP_LEVELS .
8654	1896	As crappy as things are , PEOPLE 'd be lot worse without stimulus .
8655	1896	We 've discussed that at length earlier in thread .
8656	1896	And yes , Dan , is opinion .
8657	1896	opinion strongly supported by evidence and shared by economists .
8658	1896	And your ASPECT_OPINION that OPINION has n't helped still has absolutely no ASPECT_SUPPORT of kind whatsoever .
8659	1896	Bush took us from surplus to recurring , ASPECT_STRUCTURAL_DEFICIT during time of prosperity mainly for sake of giving wealthiest Americans ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS .
8660	1896	Obama came into office in middle of worst ASPECT_RECESSION since Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION , and ran up deficit with one ASPECT_TIME_STIMULUS_MEASURES to prevent economy from collapsing completely .
8661	1896	Plus , portion of ASPECT_CURRENT_DEFICIT is simply due to lower ASPECT_TAX_REVENUES because of bad ASPECT_ECONOMY .
8662	1896	Once ASPECT_ECONOMY_RECOVERS and ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY is spent , Obama contribution to deficit will almost completely disappear .
8663	1896	Deficit ASPECT_SPENDING during ASPECT_NATIONAL_EMERGENCY -LRB- such as severe ASPECT_RECESSION -RRB- is good , necessary .
8664	1896	's like using your ASPECT_CREDIT_CARD to get through ASPECT_TEMPORARY_rough financial ASPECT_PATCH .
8665	1896	Running up recurring ASPECT_DEFICIT during prosperity is just plain irresponsible .
8666	1897	You have right to purchase ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE .
8667	1897	You just want everything given to you .
8668	1897	Man up .
8669	1897	Well I hope you learned your ASPECT_LESSON after seeing what happened when you voted for Democrat ASPECT_HOUSE_and ASPECT_SENATE .
8670	1897	They drove economy into ditch .
8671	1898	Not if it meant that everyone had to starve and share misery .
8672	1898	He did ?
8674	1898	Unemployment ASPECT_NOBODY believes failed ASPECT_STIMULUS worked , except maybe ASPECT_JOE_BIDEN , because nobody has changed BIDEN talking points lately .
8675	1898	Obama tripled that deficit and racked debt in ASPECT_1_1\/2 ASPECT_YEARS than President came before OBAMA , combined .
8676	1898	Americans who paid taxes got ASPECT_TAX_BREAK , btw .
8677	1898	Obama is about to double ASPECT_TAX_RATE on poor .
8678	1898	Lower ASPECT_TAXES = higher ASPECT_REVENUE to Treasury .
8679	1898	tired old ASPECT_KEYNESIAN_ARGUMENT has now been debunked .
8680	1898	When you are in hole , stop digging .
8681	1898	Obama recurring ASPECT_DEFICIT is going to last decades unless ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_OBAMA_BAND of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_HALFWITS are stopped .
8682	1898	Luckily , is about to happen , just in nick of time .
8683	1900	Why would you say ?
8684	1900	Is making baseless ASPECT_ASSERTIONS_and ASPECT_CONCLUSIONS on you know absolutely about norm for you ?
8685	1900	shows .

8698	1902	Since you seemed to have completely missed ASPECT_EXTENSIVE_DISCUSSION on subject , CRUMBLING will repeat CRUMBLING ASPECT_MAIN_POST on subject : In ASPECT_MARCH_2009 , month after stimulus passed , ASPECT_NATIONAL_ASSOCIATION of ASPECT_BUSINESS_ECONOMISTS conducted ASPECT_INDUSTRY_SURVEY in which 10.3 of economists forecast strong ASPECT_IMPACT on economy , 60.3 modest ASPECT_IMPACT , and 29.4 little to no ASPECT_IMPACT .
8699	1902	http:\/\/www.nabe.com\/graphweek\/2009\/gw090329.htmlAround year after stimulus was passed , studies done by ASPECT_IHS_Global ASPECT_INSIGHT , ASPECT_MACROECONOMIC_ADVISERS and Moody s Economy.com estimated that stimulus created 1.6 ASPECT_MILLION to 1.8 million ASPECT_JOBS to date and ASPECT_STIMULUS_ULTIMATE_IMPACT will be roughly 2.5 million ASPECT_JOBS .
8700	1902	http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/02\/17\/bu...leonhardt.htmlThe Congressional Budget ASPECT_OFFICE estimated that effects of stimulus in quarter of 2009 were 2.1 million ASPECT_JOBS created , GDP boosted by 3.5 , and unemployment improved by 2.1 ASPECT_ECONOMISTS_ESTIMATE for quarter of 2010 is 2.8 million ASPECT_JOBS and 4.2 ASPECT_GDP .
8701	1902	Unfortunately CRUMBLING had to rely on Wikipedia for numbers http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stimulu..._under_the_Act because PDF 's on CBO website are n't working for CRUMBLING .
8702	1902	http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/Even ASPECT_BEN_STEIN , as conservative ASPECT_ECONOMIST as you could wish for and certainly no ASPECT_FAN of ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION , implies in article discussing failure of ASPECT_LEHMAN_BROTHERS that ASPECT_STIMULUS_and ASPECT_BAILOUTS were both necessary and at least ASPECT_EFFECTIVE .
8703	1902	`` But losses to economy following failure of Lehman have been on order of hundreds of billions , maybe trillions .
8704	1902	Certainly rescue and ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGES needed in wake of ASPECT_LEHMAN_FAILURE have amounted to trillions .
8705	1902	While CRUMBLING certainly ca n't speak for ASPECT_MR_STEIN , CRUMBLING would imagine STEIN would argue that ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY could have been better spent to effect , but 's not as saying that stimulus has had no ASPECT_EFFECT at or even made things worse .
8706	1902	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/SPECTATOR.ORG\/ARCHIVES\/2010\/0...-OF-DEPRESSIONIN_CASE , 288 ASPECT_BILLION of stimulus , 37 of , went to ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS of ASPECT_VARIOUS_KINDS .
8707	1902	Are ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/SPECTATOR.ORG\/ARCHIVES\/2010\/0...-OF-DEPRESSIONIN going to argue that ASPECT_TAX_CUTS do n't stimulate economy , onalandline ?
8708	1902	Basically , ECONOMY comes down to .
8709	1902	Are going to deny that we were on brink of another great ASPECT_DEPRESSION ?
8710	1902	Are going to deny that WE 've moved back from brink since then ?
8711	1902	You can argue exactly how stimulus helped economy , and you can certainly make case that money could have been spent more effectively .
8712	1902	But if you want to say that stimulus had no ASPECT_EFFECT at , CRUMBLING 'm afraid you 're going to have to back that up with fairly substantial .
8713	1902	Maybe economy would have stopped short of brink on ECONOMY , and maybe ECONOMY would n't have .
8714	1902	Do you really think we should have taken that risk and ASPECT_DONE ?
8715	1902	and once again WE come back to ASPECT_SIMPLE_QUESTION , which is preferable , 10 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , or 25 ?
8716	1902	Yes , ASPECT_CURRENT_DEFICITS are history-making and record-breaking .
8717	1902	Because recession is history-making and record-breaking .
8718	1902	of increase in deficit under Obama has been due to recession , either directly to lost ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE caused by dropping ASPECT_GDP_OR to ASPECT_VARIOUS_STIMULUS_and ASPECT_BAILOUT_MEASURES to combat recession .
8719	1902	You do n't worry about ASPECT_WATER_CONSERVATION when your ASPECT_HOUSE is on fire , even if you 're in middle of drought .
8720	1902	Obama has said that once ASPECT_ECONOMY recovers OBAMA will reduce deficit and ASPECT_WORK on balancing budget , and considering that so far OBAMA has mostly done exactly what ASPECT_OBAMA said OBAMA 'll do , CRUMBLING 'm going to give OBAMA time to make good on promise .
8721	1902	If OBAMA does n't , CRUMBLING ASPECT_PROMISE CRUMBLING 'll be as mad at OBAMA as you are .
8722	1902	Even putting ASPECT_DIRECT_EFFECTS on economy aside , ASPECT_INFRASTRUCTURE_SPENDING in ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL is we desperately need .
8723	1902	US has been neglecting US infrastructure since 70 , and US 's starting to catch up with ASPECT_WE .
8724	1902	Remember ASPECT_BRIDGE_COLLAPSE in Minneapolis in 2007 ?
8725	1902	Remember ASPECT_NEW_ORLEANS_LEVIES failing during Katrina ?
8726	1902	Remember ASPECT_NORTHEAST_BLACKOUT of 2003 ?
8727	1902	are tastes of things to come if we do n't start dealing with problem .
8728	1902	And if ASPECT_WE_INFRASTRUCTURE_DISINTEGRATES , economy wo n't be far behind .
8729	1902	For detailed ASPECT_DISCUSSION of issue , CRUMBLING would recommend ASPECT_HISTORY_CHANNEL excellent ASPECT_DOCUMENTARY , `` Crumbling of America .
8730	1902	As CRUMBLING just said in another ASPECT_THREAD : is sufficiently misleading ASPECT_STATEMENT as to qualify as lie in CRUMBLING ASPECT_BOOK .
8731	1902	Unless there 's recession , ASPECT_TAX_REVENUES pretty much always go up , regardless .
8732	1902	But so do expenditures .
8733	1902	If you set ASPECT_TAX_RATE to zero , you obviously get zero ASPECT_REVENUES .
8734	1902	So blanket ASPECT_STATEMENT that lowering taxes always increases revenues is patently false .
8735	1902	Lowering ASPECT_TAXES has two ASPECT_EFFECTS .
8736	1902	TWO decreases rate of taxes paid , which tends to decrease revenues .
8737	1902	And TWO stimulates economy , which enlarges ASPECT_TAX_BASE , which tends to increase revenues .
8738	1902	When ASPECT_TAX_RATES are very high , ASPECT_ECONOMIC_STIMULUS_EFFECT_PREDOMINATES .
8739	1902	When taxes are very low , decreased ASPECT_RATES predominate .
8740	1902	There 's curve , with ASPECT_PEAK_REVENUES somewhere in middle .
8741	1902	question is which ASPECT_SIDE of curve we 're on right now ?
8742	1902	Considering that ASPECT_CURRENT_US ASPECT_TAX_RATES are really very low , both by ASPECT_HISTORICAL_US ASPECT_STANDARDS and compared to industrialized ASPECT_COUNTRIES , and considering Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS clearly created deficit , CRUMBLING think answer is fairly obvious .
8743	1902	Then why has TAX been used by Presidents of both ASPECT_PARTIES and philosophies in ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DOWNTOWN since Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION ?
8744	1902	ASPECT_KEYNESIAN_ECONOMICS have been debunked ?
8747	1902	By whom ?
8748	1902	Creating ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_RATIONALIZATION about why worked really did n't does n't change reality of situation .
8749	1902	Speaking of ideology , it seems awfully convenient that yours seems to think that ills can be cured with medicine - you not having to pay taxes .
8750	1902	Where did mad ASPECT_NOTION that deficit is somehow equivalent to bad ASPECT_ECONOMY come from , anyway ?
8751	1902	makes no ASPECT_SENSE .
8752	1902	relationship between deficit and economy is complex , and ca n't be whittled down to ASPECT_SIMPLE_ONE to one ASPECT_CORRESPONDENCE .
8753	1902	In circumstances deficit can help economy , in others hurt DEFICIT , and DEFICIT still others have no appreciable ASPECT_EFFECT at all .
8754	1902	On what basis do you claim that Obama has created recurring ASPECT_DEFICIT at , or DEFICIT will last decades ?
8755	1902	of increase of deficit under Obama have been due to falling ASPECT_REVENUES caused by recession , and ASPECT_STIMULUS_MEASURES .
8756	1902	stimulus is not recurring ASPECT_EXPENSE , STIMULUS has ASPECT_END_DATE .
8757	1902	Name one in stimulus does n't .
8758	1903	ASPECT_KES_or ASPECT_KESSY is fine , Dan .
8759	1903	And as PRAGMATIST 've said times ASPECT_BEFORE , PRAGMATIST 'm pragmatist - PRAGMATIST 'm entirely convincible on almost ASPECT_ANYTHING , and do n't particularly want to believe anything in cases .
8760	1903	And PRAGMATIST never hold onto position when evidence is clearly against PRAGMATIST .
8761	1903	If you want PRAGMATIST to agree with you , then show PRAGMATIST .
8762	1903	Show PRAGMATIST your ASPECT_FACTS , your ASPECT_EVIDENCE , coherent ASPECT_ARGUMENT , heck , anything at .
8763	1903	PRAGMATIST will listen , and change ASPECT_PRAGMATIST_MIND if what you show ASPECT_PRAGMATIST_STACKS up .
8764	1903	PRAGMATIST do n't believe in ideology .
8765	1903	\*\* \*\* ASPECT_IDEOLOGY .
8766	1903	Beliefs are bad , we should never have anything stronger then opinions .
8767	1903	And as for ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_LAW - sources ?
8768	1904	ASPECT_NAIC.ORG_NATIONAL_ASSOCIATION of ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMMISSIONERSA_GOVT_BODY , as ASPECT_NON_partisan as ASPECT_ANYTHING gets .
8769	1904	's one .
8770	1904	Your ASPECT_STATE_INSURANCE_COMMISSIONER would be another .
8771	1904	REPUBLICAN should not have to tell you .
8772	1904	Searching for truth you 'd find SEARCHING on your .
8773	1904	Searching to prove ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_WRONG will lead you to partisan ASPECT_WEBSITES are meaningless for you or ASPECT_I._REPUBLICAN 'm not ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_, ASPECT_REPUBLICAN 'm realist .
8774	1904	Liberals are right when LIBERALS say Bush was bad .
8775	1904	LIBERALS 're are wrong when LIBERALS say obummer is good .
8776	1904	LIBERALS are both ASPECT_BAD .
8777	1904	And spending is worst ASPECT_PROBLEM made worse , and not listening to EACH public is second worst ASPECT_PROBLEM had\/has .
8778	1905	Thse ASPECT_KEYNESIANS were dead wrong .
8779	1905	as we now know .
8780	1905	Dead ASPECT_LINK .
8781	1905	Nope , they said saved or created , which as WE know is BS .
8782	1905	You can not quantifu job saved .
8783	1905	Yet GDP is in toilet .
8784	1905	Yet unemployment is still around 10 and has n't moved .
8785	1905	Reality seems to be different than guesses of liberal ASPECT_KEYNESIANS who made bogus ASPECT_PREDICTIONS .
8786	1905	-LRB- quote -RRB- estimate for quarter of 2010 is 2.8 million ASPECT_JOBS and 4.2 ASPECT_GDP .
8787	1905	Unfortunately I had to rely on Wikipedia for numbers http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stimulu..._under_the_Act because PDF 's on CBO website are n't working for I .
8788	1905	http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/\/\/quote]Well THEIR work or ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.CBO.GOV\/\/\/QUOTE]WELL , and estimate for GDP is paltry ASPECT_.7 on low ASPECT_SIDE and 2.7 on ASPECT_HIGH_SIDE .
8789	1905	In words , failure .
8790	1905	In 2012 numbers get even ASPECT_WORSE , with .2 on low ASPECT_SIDE and .7 on ASPECT_HIGH_SIDE .
8791	1905	http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/ftpdocs\/117xx\/doc...08-24-ARRA.pdf Here is what ASPECT_BEN_STEIN said : Another dead ASPECT_LINK ... Yes , Democrat ASPECT_MISHANDLING of ASPECT_HOUSING_CRISIS could have been avoided .
8792	1905	We are worse off now than if WE had done .
8793	1905	NOW did harm than good .
8794	1905	5 , like WE had under Bush before Democrats took over ASPECT_CONGRESS .
8795	1906	continued ... ASPECT_CURRENT_DEFICITS are due to waste of over trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS should have been rebated back to ASPECT_TAX_PAYERS , not paid out as ASPECT_PORK_and ASPECT_POLITICAL_FAVORS to unions did to help economy .
8796	1906	Less than 100 ASPECT_BILLION went to infrastructure .
8797	1906	Obama just admitted that there were no ASPECT_`` shovel ready ASPECT_JOBS .
8798	1906	was lie .
8799	1906	And I corrected you on thread .
8800	1906	Keynesianism prolonged Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION , and has led to lost ASPECT_DECADE in Japan , as they tried exactly failed ASPECT_POLICIES that Obama is trying now .
8801	1906	Keynesianism will now take KEYNESIANISM place next to Marx on dustbin of history .
8802	1906	I already pay far than I fair ASPECT_SHARE of taxes .
8803	1906	SHARE awfully convenient that your ASPECT_IDEOLOGY consists entirely of stealing from productive in order to subsidize nonproductive .
8804	1906	Obama campaigned against deficits , right ASPECT_BEFRE_OBAMA created largest ASPECT_DEFICITS in ASPECT_NATIONS_HISTORY .
8805	1906	Where do you think money to pay for ASPECT_OBAMA_PORK has come from ?
8806	1906	MONEY is borrowed ASPECT_MONEY , mortgaged on backs of children .
8807	1906	stimulus is wasteful ASPECT_SPENDING .
8808	1906	STIMULUS did , and money has to be paid back .
8809	1906	STIMULUS will take 10-20 ASPECT_YEARS t do STIMULUS , so STIMULUS is recurring books year .
8810	1907	Convienient ASPECT_OF you to exclude ASPECT_SALES_TAX_, ASPECT_SERVICE_TAXES , ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY_TAXES_and ASPECT_MEDICARE_TAXES just so you can tell me ME have no ASPECT_RIGHTS as American .
8811	1907	Guess what ASPECT_BUDDY ?
8812	1907	GUESS does n't matter what you think .
8813	1907	ME pay taxes just like everyone in country .
8814	1907	And in peak of ASPECT_ME_POST_GRADUATE_CAREER ME 'll probably be in one of highest ASPECT_TAX_BRACKETS .
8815	1907	And ASPECT_ME_HOPE by ASPECT_TIME_ME get there that ASPECT_ME_TAX_RATE is somewhere around 50 .
8816	1907	Because 's sensible ASPECT_RATE for top ASPECT_TAX_BRACKET .
8817	1908	Whatever you say .
8818	1908	You are already moving towards ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_SIDE ... you know you are voting for Snyder .
8819	1908	There 's no as 50 sensible ASPECT_TAX_RATE .
8820	1908	will make you sick if ever happens .
8821	1908	Why do n't you make little ASPECT_PROMISE to yourself that even if you are n't taxed that , you donate difference .
8822	1908	You can show your true ASPECT_PATRIOTISM then .
8823	1908	Also , I do n't consider ASPECT_PATRIOTISM_paying ASPECT_TAXES when you take more from government than you give in .
8824	1909	My ASPECT_REPLY was rebutting Megadeaths ASPECT_SMARTASS_ANSWERS_and ASPECT_STATEMENTS running down MY ASPECT_PEOPLE_and ASPECT_COUNTRY -LRB- USA -RRB- in hypocritical ASPECT_MANNER for part .

8851	1916	SO far I have just smashed everyone of you pompous and ignorant ASPECT_ASSERTIONS .
8852	1918	Ok , well I have pointed out ASPECT_PREVIOUSLY that Australian ASPECT_ABORIGINAL_HISTORY is quite shocking , nd subservience to British and then ASPECT_AMERICAN_ALLIANCES was ridiculous .
8853	1918	In terms of US I have pointed out you low ASPECT_STANDARD of living for your ASPECT_STATUS economically , your low ASPECT_LEVEL of health , ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY_, education and ASPECT_HAPPINESS , areas in which Australia surpasses you .
8854	1918	What has US done well ?
8855	1918	Well it was society to create true liberal ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PRINCIPLES lasted effectively .

8917	1926	should be ASPECT_SELF_EVIDENT , and for you to assumepeople who did n't pay taxes should have gotten one just shows your ASPECT_LACK of understanding .
8918	1926	Congress , by one ASPECT_VOTE , chose not to extend Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS will expire on ASPECT_JAN_1 , ASPECT_2011 .
8919	1926	Thus Democrats are responsible for largest ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE in country history , to go along with records of highest ASPECT_DEFICITS , highest ASPECT_DEBT , etc. There will be 50 ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE for poor because of Democrats .
8920	1926	I corrected I to ASPECT_TAX_REVENUES rose after ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
8921	1926	Where is proof that things are better ?
8922	1926	Is ASPECT_UE_RATE lower ?
8923	1926	Where are jobs ?
8924	1926	Suspending ASPECT_REALITY is what makes you liberal .
8925	1927	Democrat ASPECT_CONGRESS is responsible for destruction of economy started in 2006 .
8926	1927	Obama was part , and OBAMA compounded problem when OBAMA took office by taking money out of economy to spend on ASPECT_PORK 'n unions .
8927	1928	ASPECT_AUG_30 ASPECT_2010 is `` old ?
8928	1928	Here 's more recent for you : Did ASPECT_STIMULUS_Create ASPECT_JOBS ?
8929	1928	Yes , ASPECT_STIMULUS_LEGISLATION increased employment , despite false ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CLAIMS to contrary .
8930	1928	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.FACTCHECK.ORG\/2010\/09\/DID...S-CREATE-JOBS\/_Your ASPECT_UNSUBSTANTIATED say so does n't impress me .
8931	1928	Maybe ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.FACTCHECK.ORG\/2010\/09\/DID...S-CREATE-JOBS\/_impresses ASPECT_OTHERS .
8932	1928	So was Bush .
8933	1928	And so was Bush when 2009 ASPECT_BUDGET was enacted .
8934	1928	Millions paid ASPECT_FICA_TAXES and got no ASPECT_TAX_BREAK from Bush ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION whatsoever .
8935	1928	Bush did n't cut taxes working poor ASPECT_PAY .
8936	1928	We can only hope .
8937	1928	WE need to undo Bush ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION policies which got WE into mess .
8938	1928	So instead of paying 1 they pay 1.50 .
8941	1928	Once THEY stopped cutting taxes , revenues rose with inflation and ASPECT_GDP_and ASPECT_STOCKS .
8942	1928	Proportionally THEY never caught up , and was ASPECT_SINGLE_biggest ASPECT_REASON for 5 ASPECT_TRILLION Bush ran up after inheriting surplus ASPECT_BUDGET .
8943	1928	economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 ASPECT_JOBS month and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKETS were crashing .
8944	1928	Not economy is growing , ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR has created jobs for 9 ASPECT_STRAIGHT_MONTHS , and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET is up ASPECT_65-70 since ASPECT_MARCH_2009 .
8945	1928	We are not out of ASPECT_DEEP_HOLE recession put WE in , but WE are n't getting deeper , in stark ASPECT_CONTRAST to picture in ASPECT_QUARTER_2009 .
8946	1928	Not enough demand as ASPECT_PEOPLE_and ASPECT_BUSINESSES pay down debt .
8947	1928	Can you image situation if stimulus had not been passed ?
8948	1928	Yet ME 'm one supporting ASPECT_ME_ASSERTIONS with ASPECT_CITATIONS_and ASPECT_DATA .
8949	1928	You 're one relying on unsupported ASPECT_BLATHER .
8950	1928	Which is being shown erroneous .
8951	1929	Unsupported partisan ASPECT_NONSENSE .
8952	1929	Democrats were ASPECT_MINORITY_PARTY with little ASPECT_POWER to do anything when destruction of economy started in 2006 .
8953	1929	Which actually had started well before as Govt sat by while frenzied ASPECT_SPECULATION in ASPECT_ESTATE_MARKET coupled with unregulated ASPECT_LENDING_PROCEDURES created bubble had maxed out in 2006 .
8954	1930	government sat by ... you mean ASPECT_BARNEY_FRANK , ASPECT_CHRIS_DODD , and ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA sat by ... hmmm ?
8955	1932	Democrats did not control ASPECT_CONGRESS_AGENDA or administration of Govt .
8956	1932	was Republicans and ASPECT_BUSH promoting BUSH `` ASPECT_OWNERSHIP_SOCIETY_AGENDA .
8957	1932	Dems did vote in favor of only bill ever passed by either ASPECT_HOUSE during ASPECT_TIME_REPUBLICANS_controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS which passed in 2005 .
8958	1932	And went nowhere because of opposition by WH .
8960	1934	Not gonna happen .
8961	1934	Keep dreamin .
8962	1935	Your ASPECT_AVATAR says `` undefeated .
8963	1935	What strange ASPECT_THINK to have in light of posts :9 -17 -2008 9-15-08 9-15-08 ASPECT_9-13-08 Maybe you mean `` undefeated in ASPECT_RING_TOSS_OR .
8964	1935	Certainly not in ASPECT_POLITICAL_POSTS here at PF .
8965	1936	is complete and ASPECT_LIE , and shows profound ASPECT_LACK of even slightest ASPECT_UNDERSTANDING of economics .
8966	1936	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_COLLAPSE was result of ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE that burst .
8967	1936	problem was brought about by of different poor ASPECT_DECISIONS , starting earlier than 2006 .
8968	1936	blame lies quite clearly with Republicans , but also with Fed , Democrats , Banks , and groups as well .
8969	1936	with even passing ASPECT_UNDERSTANDING of economics realizes that ASPECT_ECONOMIC_COLLAPSE has roots that go back to way before 2006 , and only mentally deficient partisan ASPECT_HACKS believe problems started in 2006 -LRB- actually ASPECT_2007 -RRB- when ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CONGRESS came to power .
8970	1936	If Democrats are to blame in way -LRB- HACKS certainly share of blame -RRB- , HACKS ASPECT_CONTRIBUTIONS go back ASPECT_LATE_90S WAY more than HACKS do 2006 -LRB- actually 2007 ASPECT_-RRB- .
8971	1937	Fairly good ASPECT_POST .
8972	1937	If you just changed sentence : `` blame lies quite clearly with Republicans , but also with Fed , Democrats , Banks , and groups as well .
8973	1937	`` To read : blame lies quite clearly with politicians of both ASPECT_PARTIES , but also with Fed , Banks , and groups as well .
8974	1937	Then YOU would be in agreement with you .
8975	1940	I agree with Dan on one .
8976	1941	What we need is party in power will limit government and bring it back to IT Constitutional ASPECT_OBLIGATIONS .
8977	1941	closest ASPECT_WE got going are ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_CONSERVATIVES running as Republicans .
8978	1942	should be short ... No , there is no ASPECT_EVIDENCE to back you up , speculation .
8979	1942	estimate is not evidence .
8980	1942	ASPECT_CURRENT_unemployment ASPECT_RATE is not ASPECT_9.2 , RATE is 9.6 , so there goes your ASPECT_ARGUMENT .

8988	1942	Here is nice ASPECT_LIST for you to start on .

8992	1942	You are merely pulling out of your ASPECT_RUMP .
8993	1942	Sure has ... Bwahahaha !
8994	1942	You think you are one teaching lesson here ?
8995	1942	I have forgotten more about economics than you will ever learn .
8996	1942	There is you can teach I .
8997	1942	Your ASPECT_IGNORANCE is boundless , which makes you great ASPECT_FOLLOWER of Zero .
8998	1942	YouTube - Greatest ASPECT_MOVIE_LINE ever !
8999	1944	LOL was funny .
9000	1945	I have no ASPECT_PROBLEM following your infantile ASPECT_REASONING .
9001	1945	I 've been working in ASPECT_INVESTMENT_MANAGEMENT_BUSINESS studying economics I life .
9002	1945	I know what works in world .
9003	1945	No , ASPECT_NO are not , especially when NO are wrong by degrees of magnitude , and have to be constantly corrected .
9004	1945	You keep living in your ASPECT_DREAM_WORLD , and I will keep intruding with reality .
9005	1945	So you admit your ASPECT_RESOURCES that you place your ASPECT_LEFTIST_FAITH in are flawed and unreliable ... I will stick to ASPECT_REALITY_and ASPECT_HISTORY .
9006	1945	FAITH is n't better , but you are pulling numbers out of air .
9007	1945	We will soon see 10.3 , however , thanks to Obama policies .

9009	1945	ASPECT_MID-MONTH_MEASUREMENT confirms ASPECT_LATE_SEPTEMBER_SURGE in joblessness should be reflected by government s ASPECT_NOV._5 unemployment ASPECT_REPORT .
9010	1945	Is 10 ASPECT_BETTER , or worse than ASPECT_9.6 ?
9011	1945	Take your ASPECT_TIME ... recession is two consecutive negative ASPECT_QUARTERS of ASPECT_GDP_GROWTH , so we could have ASPECT_DOUBLE_DIP , and ASPECT_PROBABLY will unless Obama is stopped .
9012	1945	You used that arbitrary as if to say that if Obama had not wasted 1 ASPECT_TRILLION on ASPECT_STIMULUS_WE would have 25 ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT .
9013	1945	You do n't know how bad ASPECT_STIMULUS would have gotten without wasted ASPECT_MONEY .
9014	1945	STIMULUS probably would have gotten better , we would not have mortgaged ASPECT_WE_CHILDREN future on liberal ASPECT_PORK to unions .

9016	1945	Conservatism ends recessions .
9017	1945	Liberalism prolongs recessions .

9025	1945	is why America is taking keys away in 336 ASPECT_HOURS .
9026	1946	I know ...
9027	1949	recession ended 6 ASPECT_MONTHS after ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA was elected .
9028	1949	How much faster do you expect president to act ?!
9029	1950	You ca n't claim recession or ASPECT_DEPRESSION ended until years after fact .
9030	1950	Things are still getting worse , RECESSION 's not even over yet .
9031	1951	Your ASPECT_KOOL-AID must be 100 ASPECT_PROOF days !
9032	1952	How do you define `` recession ?
9033	1953	It is over year after fact .
9034	1953	recession ended ASPECT_JUNE_2009 .
9035	1953	We know for fact recession ended then .
9036	1953	If economy starts to shrink again then would be another ASPECT_RECESSION entirely .
9037	1953	Though I do n't know where you get that things are getting worse ... economy is continuing to grow , though not as fast as people would like .
9038	1953	However MATTER matter of time till jobs start coming back .
9039	1953	Companies are reporting ASPECT_RECORD_NUMBERS of cash on hand .
9040	1953	COMPANIES just need assurance that is stable ASPECT_ECONOMY is n't going to crash again .
9041	1953	And and we are seeing slowly but surely economy is stabilizing ECONOMY .
9042	1953	MATTER matter of time now .
9043	1954	In whatever ASPECT_WAY makes Obama look bad .
9044	1954	If by 2014 ASPECT_OBAMA is still president and we have 4.5 ASPECT_&#37;_unemployment ASPECT_OBAMA 'll be saying WE 're in recession because there are still people who are unemployed .
9045	1954	Or WE 're about to enter recession .
9046	1954	One of .
9047	1954	Republicans ASPECT_WE 're saying WE are about to enter recession throughout 90s .
9048	1954	recession never did happen way up until 2007 .
9049	1954	Turns out Clinton policies kept ASPECT_WE_recession ASPECT_FREE for 15 ASPECT_YEARS .
9050	1955	I 'm just curious if he asserts we are still in recession , what ASPECT_DEFINITION HE is using and source for HE definition .
9051	1956	Actually , 's not true , Bill .
9052	1956	US had recession in 2000 - 2001 , caused largely by ASPECT_TECH_BUBBLE bursting .
9053	1956	Let be honest here , folks , economy is ASPECT_ENORMOUS_BEAST with ASPECT_TREMENDOUS_AMOUNT of inertia tends to do as BEAST ASPECT_PLEASES .
9054	1956	government has limited ASPECT_ABILITY to influence what GOVERNMENT does , and within government ASPECT_FEDERAL_RESERVE has ability to effect economy then President and Congress .
9055	1956	There 's only so much President can do , positive or ASPECT_NEGATIVE .
9056	1956	And for ASPECT_UMPTEENTH_TIME , economy right now is stagnant , not in recession .
9057	1957	You 've probably noticed , in life , that `` stagnant has ASPECT_CERTAIN_unpleasant ASPECT_ODOR about STAGNANT .
9058	1957	Do you know difference between humor and ASPECT_ODOR ?
9059	1957	Humor is shift of wit !
9060	1957	Just tryin ' to lighten up .
9061	1958	Good ASPECT_POST , but there are recessions and then there are recessions .
9062	1958	2001 `` ASPECT_CLINTON_RECESSION as conservatives often call RECESSION was more like slowdown .
9063	1958	As ASPECT_GDP_FIGURES were ultimately calculated , GDP never went down in two consecutive ASPECT_QUARTERS , which is classic ASPECT_TEST of recession , and in worst ASPECT_YEAR , FY2001 , GDP increased 1.1 , and GDP increased over ASPECT_3 .
9064	1958	CLINTON know you did n't compare CONSERVATIVES , but 2001 `` ASPECT_RECESSION , if it is even fair to call 2001 recession -LRB- CLINTON know NBER classified NBER as -RRB- was different ASPECT_BEAST that recession ASPECT_OBAMA inherited .
9065	1959	-LRB- giggles -RRB- Yes , DAN 're absolutely right , Dan .
9066	1959	Stagnation sucks , big ASPECT_TIME .
9067	1959	But recession sucks more .
9068	1959	It 's like difference between wildfire 's raging out of control and one 's been contained but not put out .
9069	1960	's cute .
9070	1960	Though am curious as to your ASPECT_RESPONSE to question : How do you define `` recession ?
9071	1960	When you accuse others of `` ASPECT_DRINKING_KOOLAID 'd expect you could at least defend your ASPECT_POSITION as to basis for assertion .
9072	1961	But it ` hai n't ' no ASPECT_WAY to get re-elected !
9073	1961	Do you know difference between ASPECT_EPILEPTIC_OYSTER_SHUCKER and prostitute with diarrhea ?
9074	1961	ASPECT_EPILEPTIC_OYSTER_SHUCKER_SHUCKS between fits !
9075	1962	... ... `` ended ... ... so they say ... ASPECT_JOB_MARKET is still bleak -LRB- but looking better -RRB- and we have tons of debt to china ... ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_BOND ?
9076	1962	ASPECT_WE_NEED_RECOVERY , Just like BO needs vacations to recover
9077	1964	Actually no there was no ASPECT_RECESSION in 2000-2001 .
9078	1964	recession is 2 ASPECT_SEQUENTIAL_QUARTERS of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_SHRINKAGE .
9079	1964	There was never 2 ASPECT_QUARTERS of shrinkage between 2000 and ASPECT_2001 .
9080	1964	So there was never recession .
9081	1964	Just ASPECT_SLOWDOWN .
9082	1965	ASPECT_TSK_, ASPECT_TSK , Bill .
9083	1965	If you 're going to reproach others for presenting facts in deceptive ASPECT_WAY , you really should n't do WAY yourself .
9084	1965	US GDP fell in and ASPECT_THIRD_QUARTERS of 2001 .
9085	1965	Technically not recession , but for ASPECT_PRACTICAL_PURPOSES_TECHNICALLY was .
9086	1965	TECHNICALLY was also ASPECT_WORLDWIDE_SLOWDOWN , and countries did meet ASPECT_OTHERS ASPECT_TECHNICAL_DEFINITIONS of recession .
9087	1965	Yes , it was very mild ASPECT_RECESSION , but do n't try to explain RECESSION away .
9088	1965	RECESSION really not good ASPECT_IDEA to hide behind technicalities .
9089	1967	I stand by I ASPECT_CLAIMS .
9090	1967	I asked you to provide quotes to back up your ASPECT_CLAIMS however they are non existent .
9091	1967	I do not take your ASPECT_WORD for ASPECT_WORD_PAL , no ASPECT_OFFENSE meant I ask everyone to provide ASPECT_SOURCES_or ASPECT_QUOTES .
9092	1967	Ok , onward ?
9093	1967	Now you ask what has ASPECT_UNITED_STATES done so well ?
9094	1967	She is super ASPECT_POWER and world ASPECT_LEADER like POWER or not .
9095	1967	is not arrogant ASPECT_STATEMENT , POWER is statement of fact .
9096	1967	SHE is bastion of freedom and truly was at forefront of saving world from speaking ASPECT_GERMAN_and ASPECT_JAPANESE .
9097	1967	There is just too much to list .
9098	1967	-LRB- ASPECT_\/_QUOTE -RRB- And ?
9099	1967	You say things , and just in your ASPECT_GUN_CONTROL_ARGUMENT you cling to studies funded to say what you want to hear .
9100	1967	Sorry fails in debate .
9101	1967	Your and second ASPECT_SENTENCE why your ASPECT_IDEA about USA is incorrect .
9102	1967	If we had n't been that I highly doubt your ASPECT_COUNTRIES would exist .
9103	1967	In WW2 if USA had not of assisted your ASPECT_COUNTRY WW2 would of been overrun for example .
9104	1967	And FWI , your ASPECT_STATEMENT about USA ` rather immoral ' ASPECT_BEHAVIOR is another ASPECT_EXAMPLE another hypocritical ASPECT_STATEMENT , because countries immoral ASPECT_BEHAVIOR are often exceedingly worse than USA .
9105	1967	countries sometimes act in ` rather immoral ' ASPECT_WAYS because is what must ASPECT_GOVERNMENTS do to ensure continued ASPECT_EXISTENCE of ASPECT_HOST_COUNTRIES at times .
9106	1967	However compared to countries I would rather be ASPECT_POW_ETC in USA compared to almost ASPECT_COUNTRY .
9107	1967	If USA was truly immoral I would n't say .
9108	1967	You have insinuated as , which is worse because you can not man up enough to put what you mean in ASPECT_PLAIN_WORDS .
9109	1967	Ok , to rest of forum I apologize for zinging far off topic , I will not comment on with MD again unless we start ASPECT_NEW_THREAD .
9111	1968	MAJORITY can tell you Obama seems to be swilling ASPECT_JIM_JONES koolaid like ASPECT_JONES_NAME is ASPECT_OTIS_CAMPBELL_DRINKING Mayberrys finest ASPECT_HOOCH if OBAMA thinks OBAMA is going to be reelected .
9112	1968	We have terrible ASPECT_JOB_MARKET and MAJORITY can tell Obama that ASPECT_SPENDING_TRILLIONS here and trillions there has failed .
9113	1968	smoke and ASPECT_MIRRORS of ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE_imaginary ASPECT_JOBS is pathetic ASPECT_ATTEMPT to save ASPECT_OBAMAS_BUTT .
9114	1968	However read ASPECT_MAJORITY_LIPS , Obama is gone in 2013 .
9115	1968	And , 's MAJORITY have to say about , except that MAJORITY am exceedingly happy majority of Americans ASPECT_EVEN goodly of original ASPECT_JADED ASPECT_OBAMA_LOVERS have seen golden ASPECT_BOYS_color ASPECT_FADE from gold to OBAMA true ASPECT_COLOR ; pewter gray .
9116	1968	For time MAJORITY thought ASPECT_MAJORITY_FELLOW_AMERICANS had lost leave of senses nearly worshiping ASPECT_HARVARD_` ASPECT_PROFESSOR_' -LRB- misnomer really -RRB- .
9117	1968	God does indeed work in mysterious ASPECT_WAYS .
9118	1968	ASPECT_BYEEE_OBAMA !
9120	1970	do n't worry .
9121	1970	End of world is n't till ASPECT_DEC_2012 .
9122	1970	So Obama will have time to be reelected .
9124	1971	Not like it 's going to happen anyways .
9125	1971	Keep ASPECT_DREAMIN_' .
9126	1972	Ha ha yes !
9127	1972	Still I think that out of weird ASPECT_STUFF 2012 ASPECT_PREDICTION of happening is credible .
9128	1972	Maybe ASPECT_OBAMA_AND -LRB- whoever ASPECT_GOP_MUSTERS against ASPECT_OBAMA_-RRB- will be least of worries .
9130	1973	Ha ha I did say 2013 !
9131	1973	ASPECT_MAN_HA_WAYYYY too early !
9132	1973	Nov of 2012 is date to remember eh ?
9133	1973	Hey will be squeaker .
9135	1975	ASPECT_TECHNICAL_DEFINITIONS are we have to determine what is and what is n't recession .
9136	1975	I 'd rather follow ASPECT_TECHNICAL_DEFINITION then tell everyone lie .
9137	1975	There was no ASPECT_RECESSION between 2000 and ASPECT_2001 .
9138	1975	Saying anything else is telling lie .
9139	1975	Just as saying we are in recession now is telling lie .
9140	1975	Recession has ASPECT_SPECIFIC_DEFINITION .
9141	1976	OK ASPECT_TECHNOCRAT , economy went through ASPECT_DOWN_CYCLE in 2000-2001 and is in deeper , and longer , down cycle now .
9142	1976	Try discussing your ASPECT_TECHNICAL_DEFINITIONS with 28 million unemployed and ASPECT_UNDER employed .
9143	1976	See if they give dam about your ASPECT_TECHNICALITIES !
9144	1977	There are millions of unemployed in even perfect ASPECT_ECONOMY .
9145	1977	Plus employment is lagging ASPECT_INDICATOR .
9146	1977	INDICATOR might take ASPECT_YEAR_or ASPECT_TWO after economy stabilizes for businesses to feel comfortable hiring again .
9147	1977	problem with unemployment is PROBLEM not necessarily problem with economy .
9148	1977	PROBLEM problem with confidence .
9149	1978	hallmark of liberal ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION and ASPECT_KOOL-ADE_DRINKING_liberal ASPECT_GROUPIES , EXCUSES .
9150	1978	Never before in human ASPECT_HISTORY have so ASPECT_EXCUSES , been made so often , by by so .
9151	1978	has familiar ASPECT_SOUND !!!
9152	1979	But I thought government ca n't create jobs .
9153	1979	So what do you want Obama to do exactly ?
9154	1979	Oh wait .
9155	1979	You 're one of people who said we should have done absolutely at all .
9156	1979	I wonder what sort of excuses you would have given by now .
9157	1980	There IS no ASPECT_PROOF that doing would have made anything worse , just as there is no ASPECT_PROOF that massive never ending flow of ASPECT_VARIOUS_STIMULUS_PLANS have accomplished anything but debt .
9158	1980	Of and alone , THERE IS PROOF !
9159	1980	And Govt can create jobs .
9160	1980	But they are ASPECT_GOVT_JOBS and thus are burden on vibrant ASPECT_ECONOMY rather than impetus to economy .
9161	1981	You ca n't mathematically prove anything in economics .
9162	1981	But there is lots of evidence that Stimulus has had significant ASPECT_IMPACT , as logic would tell you STIMULUS would .
9164	1982	Logic would tell us that ?
9165	1982	Unemployment is still close to it peak .
9166	1982	US spent 860 ASPECT_BILLION .
9167	1982	Next to has been done .
9168	1982	Just wait until effects of wasted ASPECT_MONEY .
9169	1983	Logic would tell us if Govt had n't pumped hundred ASPECT_BILLION in spending into economy creating demand for jobs and paying for jobs for folks who would otherwise have been fired , unemployment would have gotten higher and recession would be worse .
9170	1983	Conservatives tell US time that ASPECT_TAX_CUTS spur ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH , so if you believe that , logic would tell you that hundreds of billions in ASPECT_TAX_CUTS had efffect as well and that economy would have been worse and ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT higher without ECONOMY .
9171	1983	Finally , logic tells US from ASPECT_EMPIRICAL_DATA , including FDR ASPECT_NEW_DEAL and WWII , Govt spending stimulates economy , and finally fact that in period fact economy went from ASPECT_TANKING_-7 &#37; and losing 700,000 ASPECT_JOBS month to growing and ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_adding ASPECT_JOBS suggests stimulus had positive ASPECT_EFFECT , as ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_and ASPECT_ECONOMISTS_AGREE .
9172	1983	While 860 ASPECT_BILLION is lot , I agree , and it is almost as ASPECT_MONEY wasted in mistaken ASPECT_WAR in Iraq , comparatively MONEY represents just over ASPECT_5 of economy .
9173	1983	Given that both ASPECT_GOVT_SPENDING and deficit were cut in FY2010 , US should n't be surprised that modest ASPECT_AMOUNT of stimulus , while logic and ASPECT_EVIDENCE suggest LOGIC helped turn economy around and stop getting worse , was n't sufficiently large to really set AMOUNT on fire .
9174	1983	Unfortunately , fiscal ASPECT_MISMANAGEMENT by ASPECT_PRIOR_three ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_ADMINISTRATIONS left nation in precarious ASPECT_STATE of debt that limited ASPECT_AMOUNT of stimulus was prudent .
9175	1984	Oh ASPECT_THINGS have been done alright .
9176	1984	Backward ASPECT_PROGRESS , increased ASPECT_GOVERNMENT , bowing to ME ... Plenty has been done my friend , ASPECT_PLENTY .
9177	1985	Need I say more ?
9178	1986	Well , since you did n't actually say anything , my ASPECT_INSTINCT would be that in fact yes , yes you do .
9179	1987	I agree 100 ASPECT_&#37; .
9180	1987	problem with ASPECT_ACTIVIST_radical ASPECT_LIBERALS is that LIBERALS have no ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE .
9181	1987	Hey I have splendid ASPECT_IDEA !
9182	1987	Lets eat activists .
9184	1988	ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE means to me even idiot would know .
9185	1988	Which is why confuses hell out of ME when conservatives say CONSERVATIVES want ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE in government .
9186	1988	Sorry but ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_POLICY is complicated .
9187	1988	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY is complicated .
9188	1988	ME do n't want people with ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE in government .
9189	1988	ME want people with uncommon ASPECT_SENSE in government .
9190	1989	Right now we have people in power with : No ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE , No uncommon ASPECT_SENSE , No ASPECT_PRACTICAL_SENSE , Just ASPECT_NONSENSE .
9191	1989	PEOPLE have consistently repeated that if enough ASPECT_MONEY is spent and WE wait long enough , ASPECT_PEOPLE_unproven ASPECT_THEOREMS , will eventually work .
9192	1989	If ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_HAD_4 or 5 trillion ASPECT_EXTRA_DOLLARS laying around ASPECT_DOING , perhaps , and only perhaps , case could be made for ASPECT_PEOPLE_THEOREMS .
9193	1989	However when cent people in power are spending on Stimulus is BORROWED money with no ASPECT_END in sight or method to pay END back , theorems go out window .
9194	1989	rescinding of Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS are not even issue .
9195	1989	PEOPLE WILL hurt economy and ASPECT_PEOPLE_WON `` lower debt ASPECT_SINGLE_PENNY .
9196	1989	ECONOMY is liberal ASPECT_WINDOW_DRESSING_and ASPECT_SLEIGHT of hand .
9197	1990	860 ASPECT_BILLION is now considered `` billion , to liberals now ?
9198	1990	NOW really getting sad .
9199	1990	People just do n't realize how ASPECT_MONEY is .
9200	1991	Not that at compared to losses we would have endured .
9201	1992	Oh please .
9202	1992	Paying ASPECT_BILLIONS of dollars to save jobs .
9203	1992	It 's getting quite comical .
9204	1992	We have posted enough ASPECT_STORIES of loads of ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY creating jobs at waste of ASPECT_TAXPAYER_MONEY .
9205	1992	http:\/\/news.yahoo.com\/s\/yblog_upshot...eate-7-76-jobs$111 ASPECT_MILLION to create 54 ASPECT_JOBS ?
9206	1992	's 2 ASPECT_MILLION per job .
9207	1992	2 ASPECT_MILLION !
9208	1993	obamalama claimed that stimulus `` CREATED 50,000 ASPECT_NEW_` ASPECT_WINDFARM_' ASPECT_JOBS .
9209	1993	problem is generators were up and running BEFORE obamalama became president .
9210	1993	Another 50,000 ASPECT_JOBS ` created ' in ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_MIND .
9211	1993	Even if stimulus did create 3.5 million ASPECT_JOBS claimed , which nobody believes , including liberal ASPECT_MEDIA .
9212	1993	STIMULUS still comes to 232,571.43 , cost per job created .
9213	1993	So with 14.8 ASPECT_MILLION unemployed , we only need 3,442,057,164,000.00 stimulus to achieve ASPECT_FULL_EMPLOYMENT .
9214	1993	And ASPECT_WE_great , great , great , great , great , great , grand ASPECT_KIDS can worry about debt .
9215	1995	232,000.00 is cost of Govt created job , not salary .
9216	1995	ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_COST of creating job is 31,000.00 , not salary .
9217	1996	ASPECT_LOL_WUT ?
9218	1996	Do you just pull numbers out of your ass ASPECT_OR .
9219	1996	Where hell does 31,000 ASPECT_DOLLARS per job in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR come from ?
9220	1998	You have been brainwashed into believing Govt is answer .
9221	1998	Govt is not only NOT answer , GOVT is problem .
9222	1998	recession is\/was wholly caused by ASPECT_GOVT_MEDDLING in free ASPECT_MARKET .
9223	1998	Then ASPECT_POLITICIANS_BLAME free ASPECT_MARKET for problems Govt caused .
9224	1998	You liberals scream about deregulation of free ASPECT_MARKET_and ASPECT_CLAMOR for regulation .
9225	1998	Well we had regulation , Govt repealed many , very good , very effective ASPECT_REGULATIONS , in order to further ASPECT_THEMSELVES politically .
9226	1998	Now ASPECT_NEW_financial ASPECT_REGULATION_BILL has been passed in great ASPECT_HASTE and in completely partisan ASPECT_MANNER .
9227	1998	ALREADY NOW is seen as ridiculous .
9228	1998	SEC was exempted from ASPECT_NEW_REGS .
9229	1998	You want ASPECT_WALL_STREET to toe ASPECT_LINE_and ASPECT_LIBERALS -LRB- liberals -RRB- exempt SEC ?
9230	1998	Even ASPECT_BARNEY_FRANK blanched at .
9231	1998	FRANK said that bill was passed so quickly FRANK did n't have copy to read .
9232	1998	is absolute ASPECT_INTENTIONAL_LIE .
9233	1998	And indicative of problem of ASPECT_GOVT_MEDDLING where YOU are sadly incompetent , free ASPECT_MARKET .
9234	1998	YOU personally and liberals in general keep repeating that if Govt had not WASTED well over ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS we 'd be in bad ASPECT_SHAPE .
9235	1998	is OPINION , ASPECT_NOT_FACT .
9236	1998	fact is that recession in past have corrected YOU without ASPECT_GOVT_INTERVENTION .
9237	1998	would have been another ASPECT_ONE to correct OPINION ?
9238	1998	We will never know because ASPECT_WE_HAVE_HAD_MASSIVE_INTERVENTION by very ASPECT_PEOPLE caused recession .
9239	1998	And SEEDS of recession were NOT planted by Bush or ASPECT_REPUBLICANS .
9240	1998	clock was running long before Bush , and both ASPECT_PARTIES are equally to blame .
9241	1998	Stimulus did not and HAS not worked .
9242	1998	Liberals can not grasp that ASPECT_SIMPLE_FACT but majority of American is fully aware that obama HAS FAILED .
9243	1998	And in addition to failure , we now have debt ASPECT_ACCUMULATING than president in history .
9244	1998	Bush increased debt by average of 625 ASPECT_BILLION per year .
9245	1998	obama IS increasing debt by 1.5 ASPECT_TRILLION per year .
9246	1998	And you liberals claim Bush was terrible .
9247	1998	You ARE right , Bush was terrible ASPECT_-LRB- and BUSH was `` Govt . -RRB-
9248	1998	and now obama is ASPECT_GOVT_and ASPECT_BUSH is 2.4 ASPECT_TIMES WORSE than Bush .
9249	1998	Why does ASPECT_FREDDIE_and ASPECT_FANNIE now need ANOTHER 300 + ASPECT_BILLION to further bail LIBERALS out ?
9250	1998	Because F&F invented , bought , and guaranteed fictitious `` ASPECT_SUB-PRIME_LOANS .
9251	1998	free ASPECT_MARKET did not invent worthless ASPECT_LOANS , calling LIBERALS what LIBERALS are , ASPECT_F&F_& `` GOVT did that for good of of us .
9252	1998	ASPECT_LIBERALS_SCREAM about ruthless ASPECT_CROOKS on ASPECT_WALL_STREET .
9253	1998	TARP was passed in DEMOCRAT ASPECT_CONGRESS , and TARP bailed out , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ASPECT_, , wait for ASPECT_CONGRESS_, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ASPECT_, , ASPECT_WALL_STREET !!
9254	1998	Would CONGRESS have been better if Govt had stayed out of free ASPECT_MARKET ?
9256	1998	If they HAD , maybe there would NOT have even been recession .
9257	1998	You want proof that YOU 're drinking liberal ASPECT_KOOL-ADE and that stimulus has failed ?
9258	1998	Look to politicians feeding YOU that Kool-Ade .
9259	1998	Are ASPECT_POLITICIANS running for re-election on merits of obamacare ?
9261	1998	Are ASPECT_POLITICIANS running on great ASPECT_JOBS_REPORTS ?
9263	1998	Are ASPECT_POLITICIANS running on great ASPECT_STIMULUS_PLAN ?
9265	1998	ASPECT_POLITICIANS_CAMPAIGNS are one and one only .
9266	1998	ASPECT_F&F_OPPONENT is worse than F&F .
9267	1998	NOT how good ASPECT_F&F 've done , instead , ASPECT_F&F_OPPONENT will be even worse !
9268	1998	Ca n't YOU read between lines of what YOU own liberal ASPECT_POLITICIANS are saying ?
9269	1998	POLITICIANS 're saying , pooch is screwed , and YOU ca n't hear POLITICIANS because YOU ears are full of Kool-Ade .
9270	1999	brain ASPECT_WASHING going on here has convinced you that ASPECT_FAIRY_TALES about free ASPECT_MARKET are in fact accurate .
9271	1999	Government is not answer to problems , you are right .
9272	1999	Unfortunately for narrative you are trying to convince us of , government at times actually IS answer .
9273	1999	No ASPECT_ONE believes government should solve problems , or even ASPECT_PROBLEMS , is ASPECT_STRAW_MAN invented believers in ASPECT_LAISSEZ_FAIRE_FAIRY_TALE .
9274	1999	reality is , government did play role in ASPECT_CURRENT_ECONOMIC_CRISIS , but reality is also that market did as well .
9275	1999	Government did keep interest ASPECT_RATES too low , but BELIEVERS also deregulated whole ASPECT_INDUSTRY -LRB- means less ASPECT_GOVERNMENT , not -RRB- , and market failed .
9276	1999	Banks did act incompetently .
9277	1999	BELIEVERS did , when given freedom , cause ASPECT_MASSIVE_PROBLEM .
9278	1999	is true of consumers of housing .
9279	1999	People bought ASPECT_HOUSES_PEOPLE could n't afford , not because government made PEOPLE , but because PEOPLE made irrational ASPECT_DECISIONS .
9280	1999	Irrational ASPECT_DECISIONS are not taken into account in ASPECT_LAISSEZ_FAIRE_FAIRY_TALE_STORY .
9281	1999	Nor are ASPECT_MARKET_FAILURES , externalities , etc. But is problem of us are able to see problems ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SOLVES and problems ASPECT_PROBLEM creates .
9282	1999	US do n't need black and ASPECT_WHITE_WORLD where is problem and is solution .
9283	1999	Not when reality is that sometimes IS problem , but SOLUTION is also sometimes solution .
9284	1999	Just like is sometimes solution , but SOLUTION can also be problem as well .
9285	1999	is reality of market -LRB- I do n't call SOLUTION free ASPECT_MARKET , as is mythical ASPECT_CONCEPT made up in ASPECT_LAISSEZ_FAIRE_FAIRY_TALES .
9286	1999	SOLUTION is sort of like ASPECT_UNICORN_-RRB- , SOLUTION can do things extraordinarily well , but can not do ASPECT_OTHERS_THINGS as well .
9287	1999	Government is .
9288	1999	But takes level of ASPECT_NUANCE_and ASPECT_RECOGNITION of complexity that too are incapable of recognizing .
9289	1999	I really do tire of simplistic ASPECT_ARGUMENTS where either ASPECT_GOVERNMENT is source of problems , or greedy ASPECT_CORPORATIONS are source of problems .
9290	1999	reality is CORPORATIONS are both ASPECT_CAPABLE of doing good ASPECT_THINGS as well as bad .
9291	2000	No , just like I dont let I ASPECT_DOG_SOIL I carpet ...
9292	2001	Is meant to be ASPECT_FOLKSY_home ASPECT_TRUTH offers ASPECT_SIMPLE_INSIGHT into issue at hand ?
9293	2001	If is , please explain what in world you are talking about , because at moment MOMENT makes no ASPECT_SENSE to me , and just seems like nonsensical ASPECT_GIBBERISH .
9294	2002	In words , no I am not voting for I !
9296	2003	-LRB- giggles -RRB- ASPECT_PRAGMATIST_EARS are full of Kool-Ade ?
9297	2003	Dan , PRAGMATIST think your ASPECT_METAPHOR has kinda derailed here .
9298	2003	Look , like PRAGMATIST 've said before , PRAGMATIST 'm pragmatist - PRAGMATIST go with what works , and PRAGMATIST go where evidence leads PRAGMATIST .
9299	2003	If you want to convince PRAGMATIST of your ASPECT_POSITION , then show ASPECT_PRAGMATIST_EVIDENCE .
9300	2003	Or thorough ASPECT_ARGUMENT .
9301	2003	Or 's reason to think .
9302	2003	Just saying government is evil and always problem over and over is n't going to cut PROBLEM , you need to show how and why government is problem .
9303	2003	No ASPECT_ONE is saying that market is evil or needs to be done away with or source of but ASPECT_PROBLEMS .
9304	2003	Well , at least not with ounce of sense .
9305	2003	free ASPECT_MARKET is extraordinarily powerful ASPECT_ENGINE for creating ASPECT_MATERIAL_WEALTH .
9306	2003	But 's really ENGINE does .
9307	2003	As PRAGMATIST 've previously pointed out , market left to ASPECT_PREVIOUSLY_DEVICES can create pretty bad ASPECT_SITUATIONS .
9308	2003	ASPECT_PREVIOUSLY_NEEDS to be balanced with institutions .
9309	2003	does n't necessarily need to be government , but at least so far , government has been effective -LRB- if very imperfect -RRB- ASPECT_TOOL for doing .
9310	2003	If you have better ASPECT_SUGGESTION , please ASPECT_SHARE_SUGGESTION .
9311	2003	PRAGMATIST am not especially interested in laying blame for recession .
9312	2003	PRAGMATIST 'm much more interested in figuring out what to do now .
9313	2003	PRAGMATIST agree completely that seeds of recession go way back , and hands helped plant them .
9314	2003	But does n't help us find way out of WAY now .
9315	2003	As PRAGMATIST said before , fiscal ASPECT_STIMULUS is about ASPECT_TOOL available to President and Congress to fight recession .
9316	2003	If you have suggestion for to try , please share that too .
9317	2003	In general , PRAGMATIST believe in balanced ASPECT_BUDGETS , and do n't like deficit ASPECT_SPENDING .
9318	2003	But there are times when deficits are both appropriate and ASPECT_NECESSARY .
9319	2003	Just like you should generally keep your ASPECT_FAMILY_BUDGET balanced , but sometimes you need to borrow because of unusual ASPECT_CIRCUMSTANCES .
9320	2003	ASPECT_FAMILY_EMERGENCY , accident or unforeseen ASPECT_EXPENSE not covered by insurance , etc. .
9321	2003	comparison between ASPECT_PRESIDENTS_BUSH and Obama is not about how big deficits are , but what 're being run up for .
9322	2003	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH ran up recurring ASPECT_STRUCTURAL_DEFICIT during time of prosperity primarily to fund ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for top ASPECT_EARNERS .
9323	2003	would be sort of like quitting your well paying ASPECT_FULL_TIME_CAREER and instead taking ASPECT_PART_TIME_JOB , without changing your ASPECT_SPENDING .
9324	2003	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA , on hand , has run up deficit with emergency , limited ASPECT_SPENDING to deal with ASPECT_CURRENT_CRISIS .
9325	2003	is analogous to if you had fire in your ASPECT_HOUSE , and your ASPECT_INSURANCE did n't give you enough ASPECT_COVERAGE to fix everything , so you take out loan to get things back to how ASPECT_EARNERS should be .
9326	2003	PRAGMATIST do n't like bailouts then you do , but EARNERS are necessary .
9327	2003	Just look at damage letting ASPECT_LEHMAN_BROTHERS fail caused .
9328	2003	What would have happened if we 'd allowed , what was DAMAGE ?
9329	2003	like ASPECT_DOZEN_major ASPECT_COMPANIES ?
9330	2003	What if WE 'd let of them fail at time ?
9331	2003	Sometimes life does n't give you good ASPECT_OPTIONS , and you have to choose least bad ASPECT_ONE .
9332	2003	Surely you ran into situations like that running your ASPECT_BUSINESS , when you had to make hard ASPECT_CHOICE between lesser of two ASPECT_EVILS ?
9333	2003	Yes , stimulus has worked , just not enough .
9334	2003	We 've been over at length already , do PRAGMATIST need to go over ASPECT_CBO_REPORTS , unemployment and ASPECT_GDP_FIGURES , ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_ECONOMIC_ANALYZES , surveys of economists , and of again \* ?
9335	2003	will be , what , ASPECT_FOURTH_TIME now ?
9336	2003	like .
9337	2003	You had no ASPECT_ANSWER to evidence before , do you have one now ?
9338	2003	As for ASPECT_WAY_DEMOCRATS are running campaigns year , PRAGMATIST have to admit PRAGMATIST am completely mystified .
9339	2003	But then ASPECT_POLITICAL_CAMPAIGNS are often not governed by ASPECT_REASON_and ASPECT_FACTS ...
9340	2004	I 'm not much for laying blame either .
9341	2004	But in case , blame is on `` GOVT , people you hope will fix WHAT THEY BROKE !
9342	2004	Not ASPECT_DEMOCRATS , Not ASPECT_REPUBLICANS , not liberals , ASPECT_NOT conservatives -------- POLITICIANS of both ASPECT_PARTIES caused recession , unknowingly , and have no ASPECT_KNOWLEDGE of how to fix -------- .
9343	2004	Over and over , and over again , ASPECT_MY_POST like liberal ASPECT_OPINIONS ARE FACTS , OVER are not facts same as my ASPECT_POSTING are n't facts unless I can point to proof .
9344	2004	You say Stimulus HAS worked , just not enough .
9345	2004	is FAILURE .
9346	2004	is rewarding of mediocre as liberals are wont to do .
9347	2004	TRYING is just trying .
9348	2004	DOING is accomplishment .
9349	2004	What happens if company fails or company fails ?
9350	2004	SOMETHING ASPECT_TAKES_PLACE .
9351	2004	is free ASPECT_MARKET .
9352	2004	obamalama said GM must not fail , Many of your ` esteemed ' ASPECT_ECONOMISTS said GM must not fail .
9353	2004	GM did fail and is still unconstitutional ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_manufacturing ASPECT_COMPANY .
9354	2004	In process of becoming ASPECT_GOVT_MANUFACTURING_CO. , `` GOVT , violated long existing bankruptcy ASPECT_LAWS as were inconvenient to Govt .
9355	2004	Bond ASPECT_HOLDERS got screwed , taxpayer got screwed , and GM was GIFTED to UAW in exchange for votes .
9356	2004	And `` GOVT that you place ASPECT_SO_FAITH in , sweetened pot for UAW and GIFTED 60 ASPECT_BILLION in cash in addition to ASPECT_BAILOUT_BILLIONS .
9357	2004	Then wonderful ASPECT_GOVT claims that GM paid back of bailout .
9358	2004	Yes BILLIONS did , BILLIONS paid GOVT back with part of 60 ASPECT_BILLION in WORTHLESS ASPECT_STOCK `` GOVT purchased for GM .
9359	2004	ASPECT_STOCK_PRESENTLY worth 00.75 , IF STOCK were traded .
9360	2004	AND IS ASPECT_FACT_!!
9361	2004	AND `` GOVT , ASPECT_GAVE_CHRYSLER to FIAT .
9362	2004	Someday we will learn why , other than somehow helping UAW .
9363	2004	How do you REFUSE to see ?
9364	2004	There is much , much more .
9365	2005	I would never buy car was Government owned , I wont give reasons why ... But I think Republic is smart enough to know ...
9366	2006	Translation : JLB is far too smart for me .
9367	2006	ME tried tangling with him , and HIM handed ASPECT_ME_ME_ASS .
9368	2006	ME intend to stay on porch and not run with big ASPECT_DOGS , and ME suggest you do .
9371	2009	Thanks for input .
9372	2011	You would , would n't you ?
9373	2011	Or at least stop making predictions ... I guess people never learn .
9374	2012	Dan , breaking economy and fixing ECONOMY are two different ASPECT_THINGS .
9375	2012	While what was done wrong to get us here is important to learn from in making decisions in future , giving economy boost now is US know how to do .
9376	2012	Fiscal ASPECT_STIMULUS has been being used successfully by administrations of both ASPECT_PARTIES since Great ASPECT_DEPRESSION .
9377	2012	And as I 've already shown , there is ample ASPECT_EVIDENCE that stimulus has \* helped economy .
9378	2012	You insist on clinging to sliver of ASPECT_UNCERTAINTY_INHERENT in everything in life just because you do n't like where evidence leads .
9379	2012	's your ASPECT_PRIVILEGE , of course , but you ca n't expect else to pay attention to you if 's what you choose to do .
9380	2012	If you hit nail with hammer , and nail is only driven ASPECT_PARTWAY_IN , do you declare hammer failure and toss HAMMER away , or do you hit nail again ?
9381	2012	If ASPECT_ONE_COMPANY is going under , then sure , let market do MARKET , even if MARKET really big ASPECT_ONE .
9382	2012	But if there are lot of companies going under at time ?
9383	2012	As ASPECT_THOUGHT_EXPERIMENT , consider ASPECT_EXTREME_CASE - if company in country failed at time .
9384	2012	DISASTER would be disaster , ASPECT_RIGHT ?
9385	2012	company fails represents hit to economy .
9386	2012	Individually , failure is small enough that economy as whole can handle ECONOMY .
9387	2012	But if you get too much at one ASPECT_TIME , especially if economy is already weak , TIME can cause problem .
9388	2012	economy is resilient and can take lot of punishment , but there is limit .
9389	2014	You present `` Doomsday ASPECT_SCENARIO , and of course , result would be Doomsday , SURPRISE .
9390	2014	idea of bailing out ASPECT_WALL_STREET_WAS to ease ASPECT_CREDIT_CRUNCH .
9391	2014	They took money and kept MONEY and now report ASPECT_RECORD_PROFITS , while not easing credit at .
9392	2014	How would have failed ?
9393	2014	YOU DO ASPECT_NOT_KNOW and DOOMSDAY do n't know and obamalama does n't know .
9394	2014	But ASPECT_MONEY_SURE looks like crooked but not so smart ASPECT_POLITICIANS got hosed by crooked but smarter ASPECT_BUSINESSMEN .
9395	2015	I can see you ca n't stop thinking about I ...
9396	2016	ASPECT_BURGER_KING is hiring .
9397	2016	would suit your ASPECT_CAPACITY very well .
9398	2016	Be that you can be .
9399	2017	FIRMS only meant it as ASPECT_THOUGHT_EXPERIMENT to point out that if lot of companies fail at once , would have larger ASPECT_IMPLICATIONS beyond just ASPECT_COMPANIES .
9400	2017	Obviously FIRMS 'm not suggesting that there 's possibility that company in country could actually fail at time , 's rather silly ASPECT_SCENARIO if taken ASPECT_LITERALLY .
9401	2017	No , nobody knows how would have failed if government had done .
9402	2017	But we do know that ASPECT_LEHMAN_BROTHERS did \* fail , and had major ASPECT_REPERCUSSIONS for economy , and helped push WE into recession .
9403	2017	And WE do know that quite financial ASPECT_FIRMS were also in trouble at time .
9404	2017	Would SCENARIO really have been worth ASPECT_RISK to do ?
9405	2017	And FIRMS 'm no happier about behavior of lot of firms after got ASPECT_BAILOUT_MONEY then you are , but what can WE do ?
9406	2017	Should Congress try to pass law to make do right ?
9407	2017	Of ASPECT_COURSE_NOT , talk about ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INTRUDING on market , and COURSE probably would n't work anyway .
9408	2017	So choice ASPECT_WE_HAVE is , do WE hold ASPECT_WE_NOSES and help bunch of undeserving schmucks solely because 've managed to worm way into important ASPECT_POSITIONS , or do WE let go down and take risk 'll take rest of down with ?
9409	2017	Besides , lot of ASPECT_TARP_MONEY has been paid back , and FIRMS believe program is actually expected to turn nice ASPECT_PROFIT for taxpayer when is said and done .
9410	2017	As for stimulus ... If time you hit nail ASPECT_TIME driven in just ASPECT_TINY_BIT , even if AMOUNT ASPECT_MICROSCOPIC_AMOUNT , after trillion hits you 'll have moved nail appreciably , even if TIME 's not been driven ASPECT_WAY_HOME yet .
9411	2017	Besides , what are you going to do if you toss hammer aside ?
9412	2017	Try to drive in nail with your ASPECT_MIND ?
9413	2017	-LRB- j\/k -RRB- We 've gone from major ASPECT_RECESSION with shrinking ASPECT_ECONOMY shedding jobs at breathtaking ASPECT_RATE to stagnant ASPECT_ECONOMY with stable yet unacceptably ASPECT_HIGH_UNEMPLOYMENT .
9414	2017	is progress , even if WE still have way to go yet .
9415	2017	And there is plenty of evidence , as FIRMS 've shown , that stimulus helped .
9416	2017	When PLENTY comes to campaign ... -LRB- shrugs -RRB- What can FIRMS say ?
9417	2017	Democrats are bunch of wimps ?
9418	2017	FIRMS really do n't know what 's going on with them .
9419	2017	FIRMS 've heard talking ASPECT_HEADS on TV speculate that people running campaigns think that , `` FIRMS may be bad , but FIRMS would have been lot worse if FIRMS 'd done , is too complicated argument to get across in campaign .
9420	2017	FIRMS 've no ASPECT_IDEA if PEOPLE had idea what ASPECT_PEOPLE were talking about or not .
9421	2017	It seems like Democrats lost ASPECT_SPIN_WAR and just kinda gave up .
9422	2017	Do n't ask FIRMS why .
9423	2017	WAR seems to FIRMS -LRB- yes , is purely FIRMS impression -RRB- that people are upset about economy and scared for ASPECT_PEOPLE_FUTURE .
9424	2017	Which is , of course , completely understandable and ASPECT_JUSTIFIED .
9425	2017	But lot of times ASPECT_PEOPLE who are scared and upset react more emotionally , maybe Dems are afraid that people are too emotional ASPECT_RIGHT now to listen to ASPECT_FACTS_and ASPECT_FIGURES ?
9426	2017	FIRMS really do n't know , FIRMS 'm purely speculating here .
9427	2018	They have you thoroughly and completely brainwashed .
9428	2018	liberal ASPECT_PARTY_LINE , public is confused , public is scared , public is emotional .
9429	2018	And here you are , insulting us just like your ASPECT_MASTERS do .
9430	2018	US are not confused , US know what is going on .
9431	2018	US are not afraid .
9432	2018	US are ASPECT_BIT_EMOTIONAL , PISSED about being talked down to by incompetent ASPECT_IDIOT whose ASPECT_STRINGS are being pulled by Soros , pissed about being insulted , pissed about being told US do n't know what US 're doing , and pissed about bastardization of ASPECT_AMERICAN_DREAM .
9433	2018	And pissed about Communist ASPECT_IDEA of `` redistribution of wealth .
9434	2018	And pissed about ruinous wasteful ASPECT_SPENDING with NO ASPECT_PLAN to pay AND back .
9435	2018	Pissed about string of lies , bribes , earmarks , and technicalities used to pass ASPECT_HEALTH-CARE_INSURANCE_BILL up to 70 of nation does not want .
9436	2018	So yes we are emotional to get puppet clown out of power and then out of office .
9437	2019	I 'm sorry if what I said sounded ASPECT_CONDESCENDING or insulting , was n't I intent at .
9438	2019	So please accept I apology , I retract what I said about IDEA .
9439	2019	However , I do question whether IDEA 's good ASPECT_IDEA to judge what 's going on in world based on what politicians say , especially politicians running for office .
9440	2019	Wait ASPECT_MINUTE_DAN , that almost ASPECT_SOUNDS like you 're complaining about ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_NOT ASPECT_SPENDING_MONEY .
9441	2019	LOL Is n't LOL good if took less ASPECT_MONEY to deal with problem then was originally thought ?
9442	2019	I do n't know for sure ASPECT_HOW much , if , of ASPECT_BAILOUT_MONEY has been paid back , and I do n't really want to argue about .
9443	2019	-LRB- To be honest , I just do n't feel like doing work to come up with hard ASPECT_NUMBERS . -RRB-
9444	2019	's not really point .
9445	2019	TARP was designed to keep financial ASPECT_SYSTEM from completely collapsing , which SYSTEM did .
9446	2019	Do you think liberals wanted to bail out ASPECT_WALL_STREET ?
9447	2019	We had to do STREET because danger of severe ASPECT_DAMAGE to economy was too great .
9448	2019	Besides , Dan , what would you be saying now about government incompetence if bailouts had n't happened , and NOW had dropped floor out from under economy ?
9449	2020	Once again , unrelentingly , you present opinions as facts .
9450	2020	floor ASPECT_DID drop out of economy .
9451	2020	Would FLOOR have been worse , ASPECT_OR_NOT ?
9452	2020	We do not know .
9453	2020	But WE do know that problems WERE caused by politicians .
9454	2020	To push politicians to side and LET FREE ASPECT_MARKET_WORK , could have been wiser to do .
9455	2020	But while there is no ASPECT_PROOF of , neither is there ASPECT_PROOF that letting people caused problems continue to manipulate free ASPECT_MARKET to POLITICIANS ends was wise either .
9456	2020	WE ARE where WE are now .
9457	2020	And people in power now have had and do have but one ASPECT_SINGLE_PLAN .
9458	2020	BORROW , ASPECT_SPEND_BORROWED_MONEY !
9459	2020	Sorry that you are unable to realize that majority of Americans do not agree with `` ASPECT_PLAN .

9478	2026	You 'll note LOL on end ?

9480	2026	makes as ASPECT_SENSE as saying that idea of ASPECT_ROUND_EARTH is opinion -LRB- which ONCE is -RRB- and therefore it is equally valid to say that Earth is flat .
9481	2026	Why are you so determined to cling to idea that both evidence and your ASPECT_THEORY says is wrong ?
9482	2026	37 of stimulus was ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS , and YOU have yet to hear claim that ASPECT_TAX_CUTS do n't stimulate economy .
9483	2026	YOU 've repeatedly challenged you to come up with ASPECT_SINGLE_SHRED of evidence says stimulus did n't help economy and you 've repeatedly utterly and completely failed .
9484	2026	In case , are you seriously suggesting that if financial ASPECT_SECTOR had completely collapsed that things would n't have been much , much worse ?
9485	2026	As in Great Depression ASPECT_LEVELS of worse ?

9489	2026	Yes , politicians are human and fallible , and yes ONES do n't entirely know what ONES 're doing .
9490	2026	Just like everyone else in world .
9491	2026	Here 's ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH for EVERYONE , Dan , free ASPECT_MARKET is made up of humans who are just as fallible and just as often do n't know what ONES 're doing .
9492	2026	Nobody forced banks to make ASPECT_SUBPRIME_MORTGAGES , nobody forced banks to encourage people to borrow more then PEOPLE could afford , and no ASPECT_ONE forced PEOPLE to bundle bad ASPECT_DEBTS as derivatives have lead to so ASPECT_GRIEF .
9493	2026	politicians bear lot of blame for getting us where US are .
9494	2026	So does market .
9495	2026	Your ASPECT_ARGUMENT about `` Why should ASPECT_YOUR_trust ASPECT_POLITICIANS to get YOUR out of mess when ONES 're ones who got YOUR in MESS , can just as easily be applied to market .
9496	2026	There is no one ASPECT_SINGLE_VILLAIN in story , and there 's no ASPECT_SINGLE_QUICK_FIX , either .
9497	2026	And as for 16,000,000,000.00 , you seem to have no ASPECT_SENSE of scale when SENSE comes to money .
9498	2026	that sum can just as easily be expressed as 0.016 ASPECT_PETADOLLARS or as 1,600,000,000,000,000 ASPECT_MILLICENTS .
9499	2026	So what ?
9500	2026	Changing ASPECT_UNITS and moving decimal ASPECT_POINT to make look bigger or ASPECT_SMALLER is silly ASPECT_TACTIC .
9501	2026	difference between 50 and ASPECT_66 is not huge , especially when you 're talking about estimates of there is lot of ASPECT_UNCERTAINTY_ABOUT .
9502	2026	Even if DIFFERENCE is in billions of dollars .
9503	2027	Ummm ... say what ... ?!?!?!
9504	2028	statement is perfectly coherent .
9505	2028	You need to read STATEMENT again .
9506	2029	And , as is normally case with liberal ASPECT_MEME , CASE is completely divorced from reality .
9507	2030	Is it ?
9508	2030	And as is normally ASPECT_CASE with right ASPECT_WING_MEME , CASE is completely divorced from truth .
9509	2030	No ASPECT_ONE did force banks to do things .
9510	2030	So what exactly was objectionable about statement , other than it was reality which clashed with your preconceived ASPECT_NOTIONS .
9511	2031	fact that statement was about as divorced from reality as STATEMENT could get .
9512	2031	Of course , you live in ASPECT_OPPOSITE_WORLD , so we do n't expect you to understand .
9513	2031	Banks were indeed pressured into giving low ASPECT_INCOME -LRB- read ASPECT_SUB-PRIME_-RRB- ASPECT_LOANS .
9514	2031	People were widely encouraged to enter into home ASPECT_OWNERSHIP , despite fact that PEOPLE could not afford OWNERSHIP , and it was GSEs , through ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_PRESSURE , started practice of ASPECT_SUB-PRIME_BUNDLING .
9515	2031	So yeah ... What SUB-PRIME said was true , if by `` ASPECT_TRUE you mean `` completely false .
9516	2032	Almost everything THEY say here is easily disproven ASPECT_LIE .
9518	2032	No they were n't .
9519	2032	government was involved in ASPECT_SUBPRIME_INDUSTRY , but 85 of ASPECT_SUBPRIME_MORTGAGES were issues by ASPECT_PRIVATE_INDUSTRIES .
9520	2032	http:\/\/www.mcclatchydc.com\/2008\/10\/1...ixzz12xTyWY91AI suggest you read as ASPECT_WELL .
9521	2032	http:\/\/knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu\/a...articleid=1812The reality is , largest ASPECT_ROLE_GOVERNMENT played in creation and ASPECT_COLLAPSE of ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE , was keeping interests far too low for far too long .
9522	2032	Not ASPECT_FANNIE_and ASPECT_FREDDY , nor ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_forcing ASPECT_BANKS to give loans -LRB- ASPECT_REALITY did n't happen -RRB- , etc. ASPECT_SECURITIZATION of debt was also not forced on banks by government .
9523	2032	GOVERNMENT has history , and I can not imagine where you came up with idea that IDEA was forced onto by banks -LRB- for ASPECT_FUTURE_REFERENCE , FUTURE is best to provide links to support absurd ASPECT_CLAIMS -RRB- .
9524	2032	Read up bit on GOVERNMENT history .
9525	2032	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG\/WIKI\/SECURITIZATIONSUBPRIME_BUNDLING is 100 phenomenon of ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSTITUTIONS .
9526	2032	You really need to either educate yourself and read up on issues , or stop reading dishonest ASPECT_SOURCES that lie and distort facts .
9527	2032	reality is government certainly had role to play in causing crisis , but they were not catalyst , nor ASPECT_MAIN_CATALYST .
9528	2032	There is plenty of blame to share between government , banks , and people who took out debt ASPECT_THEY could n't possible service .
9529	2032	Your schewed dishonest partisan ASPECT_VIEW of issue , means it is best not to make ASPECT_DECLARATIVE_STATEMENTS , because when VIEW comes to issue , you do n't know what you are talking about .
9530	2033	government was ASPECT_INITIAL_MOVER of ASPECT_SUB-PRIME_LOANS .
9531	2033	ONES were ones initially pushed banks into issuing ASPECT_LOANS , and , because loans were so risky , ONES pushed GSEs into bundling ONES to mitigate risk .
9532	2033	No ASPECT_ONE in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR wanted to touch market , originally .
9533	2033	It was GSEs , with ASPECT_ONES_WINK and ASPECT_NOD_HINT that bundles would be insured by government against loss , spurred ASPECT_INITIAL_PRIVATE_INVESTOR_INVOLVEMENT .
9534	2033	truth at to your ASPECT_WORDS is that ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR and ASPECT_WALL_STREET_INVESTORS were deeply involved by time SECTOR crashed .
9535	2033	TRUTH had taken life of TRUTH in ASPECT_PRIVATE_MARKETS , leaving GSEs with less than ASPECT_HALF of bundling .
9536	2033	But INVOLVEMENT was ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INVOLVEMENT in markets got ASPECT_BALL_ROLLING , in place .
9537	2035	Sometimes Dan seems to have bit of tendency to sound like government is always cause of problems , and letting free ASPECT_MARKET operate unfettered is solution to everything .
9538	2035	My ASPECT_POINT was simply that mess we find WE in was not caused simply by ASPECT_WASHINGTON_ordering ASPECT_BANKS and institutions to make unwise financial ASPECT_DECISIONS .
9539	2035	Bad ASPECT_POLICY_DECISIONS in government certainly played role , but decisions made in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR were big big ASPECT_FACTOR in causing recession .
9540	2035	Just pointing out there 's plenty of blame to go around .
9541	2035	Like ASPECT_ALAN_GREENSPAN said about behavior of ASPECT_MORTGAGE_LENDERS , of WE who have looked to self-interest of ASPECT_LENDING_INSTITUTIONS to protect ASPECT_SHAREHOLDERS_EQUITY , MY included , are in state of shocked ASPECT_DISBELIEF .
9543	2037	Still using ASPECT_NY_Times liberal propaganda ASPECT_MACHINE as source ?
9544	2037	NYT long ago stopped paying attention to TRUTH .
9545	2037	Use better , less biased ASPECT_SOURCES .
9546	2037	You do not see me using Fox ASPECT_NEWS as source for reason .
9547	2037	Is Govt strictly to blame ?
9548	2037	VERY ASPECT_NEARLY .
9549	2037	Yes ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR did jump in and take ASPECT_FULL_ADVANTAGE of license to steal that Govt gave them .
9550	2037	Should come as surprise ?
9551	2037	Had ASPECT_GOVT_NOT created atmosphere and ASPECT_OPPORTUNITY for near illegal ASPECT_BUSINESS_PRACTICES , ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR would not have ASPECT_BEEN_ABLE to take advantage of situation did not exist .
9552	2037	Being old ASPECT_FART that ME am , ME remember days when bankers were cautious ASPECT_BUSINESS_PEOPLE around .
9553	2037	old ASPECT_JOKE was to get loan , you had to prove to banker that you absolutely did not need money !
9554	2037	If you did not have 20 down and excellent ASPECT_CREDIT and good and permanent ASPECT_JOB , RENT .
9555	2037	Because you would not get loan .
9556	2037	Bankers had no ASPECT_INTENTION of changing ASPECT_PEOPLE_ATTITUDES_and ASPECT_PRACTICES , Govt insisted that had right to own house whether PEOPLE could afford HOUSE or not .
9557	2037	As totally ASPECT_STUPID as sounds , elected ASPECT_REPRESENTATIVES actually said things .
9558	2037	And REQUIRED that bankers act toward end .
9559	2037	Do you leave your ASPECT_CAR running with ASPECT_DOORS_and ASPECT_WINDOWS open and keys in CAR , parked on ASPECT_DOWNTOWN_STREET while you go shopping ?
9560	2037	NO , you do n't .
9561	2037	But is what Govt did with ASPECT_MORTGAGE_and financial ASPECT_INDUSTRIES .
9562	2037	Yes ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR still had to be dishonest and drive away in car , so they are not blameless .
9563	2037	ME know ME to be absolutely honest , but ME 've never been tempted with BILLIONS with no ASPECT_FEAR of prosecution .
9564	2039	Well , would be one of my ASPECT_PROBLEMS with Greenspan .
9565	2039	Because once government implied that would back bundles against loss , even though it was n't supposed to be true , ONCE opened door to ASPECT_FULL_FLEDGED_INVOLVEMENT of markets .
9566	2039	Of course , ONCE was reckless , but were doing what government wanted to do .
9567	2039	lot of people saw problem develop and tried to put stop to STOP .
9568	2039	Sad that Greenspan was astonished by LOT .
9569	2039	self-interest of ASPECT_LENDING_INSTITUTIONS had ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INTEREST of pushing ASPECT_SUB-PRIME_LOANS super-imposed on top of SELF-INTEREST .
9570	2039	What really galls me is to see Obama , of people , wag ASPECT_OBAMA_FINGER at banks , as if OBAMA had no ASPECT_PERSONAL_INVOLVEMENT in mess .
9571	2039	And now , we 're supposed to forget what started NOW , and accept Obama tired ASPECT_ANALOGY of Republicans driving car into ditch .
9572	2039	NOW 's quite ridiculous .
9573	2040	Your ASPECT_LOGIC is completely flawed .
9574	2040	If not for government , environment to do sorts of things would have happened naturally .
9575	2040	With no ASPECT_RESTRICTIONS in place , THINKERS would have done .
9576	2040	Without restriction , license to steal exists naturally , only curbed by ASPECT_OTHERS_ABILITY to use force to protect ASPECT_THINKERS_ASSETS .
9577	2040	ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_NEVER required banks to do what THINKERS did .
9578	2040	THINKERS did NEVER because THINKERS were short ASPECT_TERM_THINKERS who ignored ASPECT_TERM_CONSEQUENCES of ASPECT_THINKERS_ACTIONS , in order to gain short ASPECT_TERM_BENEFITS .
9579	2040	has to do with government , and everything to do with modern ASPECT_BUSINESS_ENVIRONMENT .
9580	2040	assumption that ASPECT_UNDERLIES_right ASPECT_WING_ECONOMIC_THOUGHT is that we assume rational ASPECT_ACTORS .
9581	2040	reality is , assumption can not accurately be made .
9582	2040	People actions are far too often irrational to make assumption .
9583	2040	irrationality of actions of ASPECT_BANKERS_and ASPECT_PEOPLE taking loans , combined with artificially low interest ASPECT_RATES -LRB- idea advanced by ASPECT_FRIEDMAN_-RRB- , created mess .
9584	2040	So government had role to play , but to say very nearly ASPECT_BLAME lies with government is beyond absurd .
9585	2041	Oh , for crying out loud , ASPECT_DAN_, ASPECT_DAN was only citing ASPECT_NY_TIMES to source ASPECT_GREENSPAN_QUOTE , and DAN only used that because it was ASPECT_SOURCE_GOOGLE found for DAN .
9586	2041	Since there 's no ASPECT_DISPUTE about what GREENSPAN said , DAN did n't feel need to wade through minutes of Congressional ASPECT_HEARING_GREENSPAN said CONGRESSIONAL ASPECT_AT .
9587	2041	: PAnd do n't GREENSPAN see irony of accusing government of encouraging `` near illegal ASPECT_BUSINESS_PRACTICES considering DISPUTE government actions make illegal ASPECT_PRACTICES illegal in place ?
9588	2041	Errr , what ASPECT_PERSONAL_INVOLVEMENT ?
9589	2041	Obama was strictly ASPECT_PRIVATE_CITIZEN before ASPECT_JAN_2005 , and not involved in financial ASPECT_SECTOR at .
9590	2041	And while DAN 'm certainly not expert , DAN do n't recall important financial ASPECT_LEGISLATION going through Senate between then and ASPECT_JAN_2009 .
9591	2041	Unless can correct DAN on ?
9592	2042	I certainly can .
9593	2042	Although ASPECT_SENATORS_and ASPECT_REPRESENTATIVES had deeper ASPECT_INVOLVEMENT with blocking meaningful ASPECT_REFORM at GSEs , Obama himself was one of top five ASPECT_RECIPIENTS of funds from GSEs during ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM as Senator .
9594	2042	During time , ASPECT_SENATE_BILL_190 was released from committee favorably to floor , but was never brought to debate because Democrats made ASPECT_BILL_very ASPECT_CLEAR that SENATORS were in ASPECT_LOCKSTEP_OPPOSITION to OPPOSITION , and Republicans did not have enough ASPECT_VOTES to push for TIME on SENATORS .
9595	2042	Obama was one of Senators .
9596	2042	http:\/\/www.govtrack.us\/users\/questio...=bill:s109-190This is bill McCain unsuccessfully sought to revive during election , and Obama refused to do so , even though , by then , problem was VERY ASPECT_APPARENT to was paying attention to PROBLEM , and had grown far worse even just since bill was first released from committee .
9597	2042	Now , does to say that Obama was anywhere near as involved as ASPECT_CERTAIN_OTHERS , especially Dodd , who had so ASPECT_INVOLVEMENT with ASPECT_HOUSING_CRASH OBAMA literally retired at end of ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM .
9598	2042	But ASPECT_MR._OBAMA ASPECT_CURRENT_RHETORIC on causes of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_SITUATION simply flies in face of reality , and OBAMA is far more culpable for situation than OBAMA would like to believe .
9599	2043	Not at point he cant make up HE mind !

9608	2048	You might want to extensively research : From ASPECT_ORLANDO_PAPER : `` Gore was right that foundations will play role in keeping climate ASPECT_SCAM alive as evidence of outright climate ASPECT_FRAUD grows , just as YOU were critical in beginning when ASPECT_JOYCE_FOUNDATION in 2000 and ASPECT_2001 provided ASPECT_SEED_MONEY to start Chicago Climate ASPECT_EXCHANGE .
9609	2048	started trading in 2003 , and what trades is , essentially , air .
9610	2048	More specifically perhaps , hot ASPECT_AIR .
9611	2048	Chicago Climate ASPECT_EXCHANGE -LRB- CCX -RRB- advertises EXCHANGE as `` ASPECT_NORTH_AMERICA ASPECT_CAP-AND-TRADE_SYSTEM for six ASPECT_GREENHOUSE_GASES , with global ASPECT_AFFILIATES and projects worldwide .
9612	2048	ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA served on board of ASPECT_JOYCE_FOUNDATION from 1994 to 2002 when ASPECT_CCX_STARTUP_GRANTS were issued .
9613	2048	As president , pushing cap-and-trade is one of his highest ASPECT_PRIORITIES .
9614	2048	Now is n't special ?
9615	2048	`` CCX is supposed to become worth 10 ASPECT_TRILLION if Cap 'n' ASPECT_TRADE is passed .
9616	2048	OBAMA 'd say is very close to ASPECT_PRIVATE_citizen ASPECT_BHO , being involved in international financial ASPECT_MATTERS .
9617	2050	How bizarre ... vote for abject ASPECT_FAILURE , not one who has n't yet had chance ... who actually has world ASPECT_POLITICAL_and ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_EXPERIENCE than failure .
9618	2050	is really mindset that you carry through life ?
9619	2051	we can do is chuckle , anymore .
9620	2052	Errr , 's ASPECT_TEENY_BIT off topic , Dan - we were talking about economy , financial ASPECT_INDUSTRY , and stimulus , not climate ASPECT_CHANGE or cap and ASPECT_TRADE .
9621	2052	But since you brought ERRR up ... `` Climate ASPECT_SCAM ?
9622	2052	`` Climate ASPECT_FRAUD ?
9623	2052	And you accuse liberals of ASPECT_DRINKING_KOOL-AID ?
9624	2052	Come on Dan , debate over reality of climate ASPECT_CHANGE is over .
9625	2052	DEBATE ended 29 August ASPECT_2005 .
9626	2052	evidence that DEBATE is happening is absolutely ASPECT_OVERWHELMING at point , and trying to pretend there 's ASPECT_SCIENTIFIC_DEBATE about EVIDENCE is about on level with big ASPECT_TOBACCO_EXECS going before Congress back in 80 and saying that EXECS did n't believe that ASPECT_EXECS_PRODUCT is addictive or causes disease .
9627	2052	If you 're thinking of so called ASPECT_CLIMATEGATE_EMAIL - one said about finding trick to hide decline - I 'm afraid you 've been bamboozeled .
9628	2052	was one ASPECT_EMAIL out of then ASPECT_THOUSAND , taken completely out of context and given heaping helping of innuendo .
9629	2052	Using methods , you could make almost ASPECT_LOOK like ax ASPECT_MURDERER .
9630	2052	trick was as in , `` Hey , YOU just learned great ASPECT_NEW_TRICK for solving ASPECT_DIFFERENTIAL_EQUATIONS , and ASPECT_GENERAL_CONTEXT was discussion of finding way to integrate very different ASPECT_KINDS of data into coherent ASPECT_WHOLE .
9631	2052	Which usually ai n't easy , let I tell you .
9632	2052	people involved in email have had ASPECT_PEOPLE_WORK gone over with fine toothed ASPECT_COMB , and absolutely no wrong doing or data ASPECT_MANIPULATION has been found .
9633	2052	worst ASPECT_PEOPLE were guilty of was griping about having to hand ASPECT_PEOPLE_raw ASPECT_DATA over to PEOPLE felt would misuse WORST .
9634	2052	And even if you chose not to believe that , you could throw out life work of guys and there would still be mountain of evidence saying that climate ASPECT_CHANGE is real and CHANGE is happening .
9635	2052	In cases ASPECT_LITERAL_MOUNTAINS - ASPECT_ALPINE_GLACIERS have been retreating dramatically around world for decades .
9636	2052	You have ASPECT_HISTORICAL_climate ASPECT_RECORDS of century or ASPECT_TWO , ASPECT_ICE_CORES from Greenland , Antarctica , and ASPECT_ALPINE_GLACIERS from around ASPECT_WORLD , ASPECT_TREE_RING_DATA from around world , ASPECT_LAKE_and ASPECT_OCEAN sediment evidence from around ASPECT_WORLD - of which ASPECT_POINT to : ASPECT_CO2_LEVELS in atmosphere have spiked and temperatures are rising dramatically .
9637	2052	debate now is about how bad effects are really going to be , and how we can and should do about DEBATE .
9638	2052	And even if you still insist on denying climate ASPECT_CHANGE , how can you seriously argue that getting off of ASPECT_FOSSIL_FUELS , particularly oil , is important and urgent ASPECT_PRIORITY ?
9639	2052	Being depending on ASPECT_OIL_IMPORTS form ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST has big and obvious ASPECT_POLITICAL_and ASPECT_ECONOMIC_EFFECTS .
9640	2052	And WE 've hit ASPECT_PEAK_OIL - even with improving technology amount of ASPECT_OIL_PRODUCED is going to start inexorable ASPECT_DECLINE from now ASPECT_ON .
9641	2052	plus surging ASPECT_DEMAND for oil from rapidly developing parts of world like India and China ... ASPECT_SUPPLY_and ASPECT_DEMAND_, ?
9642	2052	And before you start saying that market will take care of MARKET ... WE 've known since 70 that WE need to get off of oil , and what has ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR done about MARKET ?
9643	2052	Not .
9644	2052	WE 've been sitting on ASPECT_WE_THUMBS for decades .
9645	2052	Brazilians , for example , have not .
9646	2052	They decided after ASPECT_OIL_SHOCKS of 70 that THEY were going to be ASPECT_ENERGY_INDEPENDENT , and guess what ?
9647	2052	THEY are .
9648	2052	Thanks to ASPECT_DETERMINED_ACTION , ASPECT_BRAZILIAN_ECONOMY mostly runs on home grown ASPECT_SUGAR_CANE_ETHANOL - THEY import virtually no ASPECT_OIL at all .
9649	2052	ASPECT_OIL_PRICES are going to start going up inexorably from now ASPECT_ON , 's just ASPECT_FACT of life .
9650	2052	If rise is gradual , sure , then market will be able to deal with RISE .
9651	2052	But what if RISE 's not gradual ?
9652	2052	We saw just ASPECT_YEARS ago that prices can spike dramatically in very short ASPECT_AMOUNT of time , even without things like terrorism or international ASPECT_POLITICS getting involved .
9653	2052	What if ASPECT_OIL_PRICES double in month - for ASPECT_SEVERAL_MONTHS in row ?
9654	2052	Is that risk ASPECT_WORTH taking ?
9655	2053	Once again you do ONCE .
9656	2053	There are 2 ASPECT_PARAGRAPHS highlighted .
9657	2053	You pick onlt and then drone on and on with opinion stated as fact .
9658	2053	Your ASPECT_UNCEASING_HABIT .
9659	2053	You believe Climate ASPECT_CHANGE to be reality , but no FACTUAL ASPECT_REALITY has been proven .
9660	2053	I 'm not saying CHANGE is not real , I 'm very doubtful as climate does fluctuate , but I do n't know either ASPECT_WAY .
9661	2053	But you ignored second and important ASPECT_PARAGRAPH .
9662	2053	If BHO IS deeply involved in CCX , then BHO serves ASPECT_BHO_BANK_ACCOUNT when talking about ASPECT_ENERGY_BILLS , not USA .
9663	2054	And once again you do ONCE , trying to ignore inconvenient ASPECT_FACTS by labeling them as opinions .
9664	2054	ONCE is fact that evidence for ASPECT_ANTHROPOGENIC_climate ASPECT_CHANGE is overwhelming , not opinion , and even cursory ASPECT_RESEARCH would tell you that .
9665	2054	And you completely ignore fact that concrete ASPECT_GOAL of cap and ASPECT_TRADE is to get us off of ASPECT_FOSSIL_FUELS .
9666	2054	But , since you want me to directly address ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA ASPECT_PERSONAL_INVOLVEMENT in CCX , let review : Noungrant -LRB- ASPECT_PLURAL_GRANTS -RRB- ASPECT_1 .
9667	2054	act of granting ; bestowing or ASPECT_CONFERRING ; concession ; allowance ; permission ASPECT_.2 .
9668	2054	ASPECT_YIELDING_or ASPECT_ADMISSION of in dispute ASPECT_.3 .
9669	2054	or ASPECT_PROPERTY_GRANTED ; gift ; boon ASPECT_.4 .
9670	2054	transfer of property by ASPECT_DEED_or ASPECT_WRITING ; especially , ASPECT_AU_appropriation or ASPECT_CONVEYANCE made by government ; as , grant of land or of money ; also , ASPECT_DEED_or ASPECT_WRITING by which transfer is made .
9671	2054	Nounfoundation -LRB- ASPECT_PLURAL_FOUNDATIONS_-RRB- ASPECT_4 .
9672	2054	donation or ASPECT_LEGACY appropriated to support charitable ASPECT_INSTITUTION , and constituting permanent ASPECT_FUND ; ASPECT_ENDOWMENT_.5 .
9673	2054	which is founded , or established by endowment ; endowed ASPECT_INSTITUTION_or ASPECT_CHARITY .
9674	2054	You will note distinct ASPECT_LACK of words like `` loan `` investment or `` repayment in definitions .
9675	2054	How then does ASPECT_JOYCE_FOUNDATION have financial ASPECT_INTEREST in worth of CCX ?
9676	2054	And even if they did , how would financially benefit ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA ?
9677	2054	Being ASPECT_FORMER_BOARD_MEMBER does not give MEMBER financial ASPECT_STAKE in FOUNDATION .
9678	2054	And even if MEMBER did have sort of investment in STAKE , which ME do n't think is even possible with charitable ASPECT_FOUNDATION , Obama assets have been put in blind ASPECT_TRUST , like Presidents .
9679	2054	So , Dan , ME 'm afraid your ASPECT_LOGIC fails not once , not twice , but three ASPECT_TIMES .
9680	2055	Naive , to infinity .
9681	2055	CCX is not charitable ASPECT_FOUNDATION .
9682	2056	Nooooo , but ASPECT_JOYCE_FOUNDATION is .
9683	2056	And you still have three ASPECT_GAPS in your ASPECT_ARGUMENT to bridge .
9684	2057	Not too take out ASPECT_NEWSPAPER adds of corruption .
9685	2057	do n't want you liberals looking too foolish .
9686	2059	You must be independently wealthy !
9687	2059	You are not seeing what citizens see !

9703	2069	Love your ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY , PHILOSOPHY shame really ...
9704	2070	Climate ASPECT_CHANGE !!!!!!!!!!!
9705	2070	Now I 'm more than bit older than you , but still I 've been around for well less than century .
9706	2070	ASPECT_MERE_70 ASPECT_YEARS .
9707	2070	In time I 've lived thru : cold ASPECT_PERIOD in ASPECT_GENERAL_WARMING_TREND .
9708	2070	ASPECT_WARMING_PERIOD in ASPECT_GENERAL_COOLING_TREND .
9709	2070	very warm ASPECT_PERIOD of ASPECT_GENERAL_WARMING_TREND .
9710	2070	very cold ASPECT_PERIOD of ASPECT_GENERAL_COOLING_TREND .
9711	2070	Stable ASPECT_PERIODS in generally unstable ASPECT_CLIMATE .
9712	2070	Unstable ASPECT_PERIODS in generally stable ASPECT_CLIMATE .
9713	2070	of above have been `` ASPECT_OFFICIAL_DECREES by learned ASPECT_PEOPLE that study ASPECT_CLIMATIC_EVENTS .
9714	2070	of above are not possible in one short ASPECT_LIFETIME , yet ASPECT_PEOPLE have been ASPECT_OFFICIAL_PROCLAMATIONS .
9715	2070	Now we are told that WE have warmed up small ASPECT_PART of DEGREE since 1900 .
9716	2070	Less than one ASPECT_HALF of one ASPECT_DEGREE_WARMER now than HALF was 110 ASPECT_YEARS ago .
9717	2070	In order for to be true , WE must assume that ASPECT_TEMPERATURE_RECORDINGS in 1900 were accurate to within less than one ASPECT_HALF of one ASPECT_DEGREE .
9718	2070	So do you BELIEVE temp recordings 110 ASPECT_YEARS ago were accurate to within ASPECT_100 to 99.75 I have very serious ASPECT_DOUBTS that they were .
9719	2071	Well , in order to decide what to make of like changing pronouncements on where climate is going , CLIMATE helps to understand bit about nature of science .
9720	2071	Science is never absolutely certain , and is never finished .
9721	2071	ASPECT_BASIC_PREMISE of science is to admit that neither researcher or instruments can ever be perfect - you do best you can , make estimate of how close you figure you probably got to truth , and then leave best ASPECT_RECORD you can as ASPECT_GUIDE to person to come along and tackle problem .
9722	2071	's true of even well established and respected ASPECT_THEORIES in science .
9723	2071	Take theory of gravity - PREMISE does n't get ASPECT_CERTAIN_then ASPECT_GRAVITY , does THEORY ?
9724	2071	And yet just ASPECT_YEARS ago NASA sent up satellite called ASPECT_GRAVITY_PROBE to try and poke holes in .
9725	2071	As far as scientists are concerned , YEARS win win - if SCIENTISTS can find holes , then SCIENTISTS can address SCIENTISTS and make theory better , and if SCIENTISTS ca n't , YEARS increases confidence ASPECT_SCIENTISTS have in theory .
9726	2071	So I 'm not really sure what `` ASPECT_OFFICIAL_PRONOUNCEMENTS you may have heard , but I can guarantee that no ASPECT_PEER_reviewed ASPECT_ARTICLE would have made claim with absolute ASPECT_CERTAINTY .
9727	2071	In fact , I figure NO 's then likely that what you heard was n't coming from scientists at ; it was probably ASPECT_NEWS_MEDIA taking tentative ASPECT_RESEARCH and blowing RESEARCH up to make good ASPECT_HEADLINE .
9728	2071	You know how people complain that one ASPECT_DAY_SCIENTISTS say that food will make you live hundred ASPECT_YEARS , and ASPECT_DAY_PEOPLE 're saying ONE 'll kill you ?
9729	2071	's not science doing , 's media .
9730	2071	scientist will say , `` Well , after following so ASPECT_PEOPLE for so ASPECT_YEARS who were eating so much of food , YOU saw following ASPECT_OUTCOMES .
9731	2071	Science is in business of dealing with very complex and ASPECT_HARD to understand things , BUSINESS 's in business of nuance .
9732	2071	As I think PEOPLE know , ASPECT_NEWS_MEDIA does n't much care for complexity or ASPECT_NUANCE .
9733	2071	So , does apply to climate ASPECT_CHANGE ?
9735	2071	Are ASPECT_SCIENTISTS absolutely certain that human caused climate ASPECT_CHANGE is happening ?
9737	2071	Could NO. turn out later that was big ASPECT_MISTAKE , misinterpretation of faulty data ASPECT_OR ?
9739	2071	Then why should we listen to warnings of climate ASPECT_CHANGE ?
9740	2071	Because life never gives ASPECT_WE_CERTAINTIES , and WE can do is make best ASPECT_DECISIONS_WE can with what WE have .
9741	2071	Generally speaking , science gets better as time goes on .
9742	2071	What scientist says today is going to be more reliable then what they were saying yesterday .
9743	2071	Global ASPECT_WARMING has been major ASPECT_TOPIC of research for good thirty ASPECT_YEARS now , and as time goes on , evidence that TIME is happening has mounted , and uncertainties shrunken , until today there is consensus in ASPECT_SCIENTIFIC_COMMUNITY that evidence overwhelmingly says EVIDENCE is happening .
9744	2071	TOPIC 's about as certain as science ever gets about anything .
9745	2071	In fact , uncertainty is now so low that ASPECT_AMERICAN_ASSOCIATION for Advancement of Science -LRB- AAAS -RRB- and ASPECT_NATIONAL_ACADEMY of Sciences -LRB- NAS -RRB- have issued quite literally ASPECT_UNPRECEDENTED_STATEMENTS about climate ASPECT_CHANGE .
9746	2071	They 're saying that climate ASPECT_CHANGE is happening , ONES 're ones doing QUESTION , QUESTION 's going to be bad , and we 'd better do about QUESTION .
9747	2071	ASPECT_AAAS_and ASPECT_NAS have \* never issued call to action like before , about ASPECT_ANYTHING .
9748	2071	Why should you listen to NEVER ?
9749	2071	Because NEVER 're prestigious , most well respected ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS of smartest ASPECT_, most well informed , and geekiest ASPECT_PEOPLE on planet .
9750	2071	NEVER 've been around since ASPECT_MID_NINETEENTH_CENTURY and have ASPECT_HUGE_REPUTATIONS to protect - NEVER ASPECT_REPUTATIONS are NEVER bread and ASPECT_BUTTER .
9751	2071	There are probably no ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS on planet with stronger ASPECT_REASON to make sure ASPECT_NEVER never ever say anything could later make NEVER look foolish .
9752	2071	guys are ASPECT_CROWN_JEWELS of science , and what ASPECT_GUYS_SAY is about as close as you 're going to get to ASPECT_OFFICIAL_PRONOUNCEMENT of what ASPECT_SCIENCE knows .
9753	2071	If you 're not convinced by what GUYS say , then from science will ever convince you of anything .
9754	2071	And 's not just scientists .
9755	2071	Pentagon takes climate change so seriously that SCIENTISTS did n't even consider question of ASPECT_PENTAGON_REALITY in ASPECT_FEBRUARY_2010 ASPECT_QUADRENNIAL_Defense ASPECT_REVIEW -LRB- QDR -RRB- and went directly to considering how to deal with ASPECT_PENTAGON_EFFECTS .
9756	2071	There 's even organization of major ASPECT_INDUSTRIES called US Climate Action ASPECT_PARTNERSHIP calling for ASPECT_IMMEDIATE_ACTION on issue , includes companies like Alcoa , Ford , GM , Chrysler , GE , ASPECT_DOW_and ASPECT_DUPONT .
9757	2071	are of companies are going to be most directly effected by action to tackle climate ASPECT_CHANGE , and 're saying we need to do QUESTION , now .
9758	2071	If you 're not going to believe guys , who are you going to believe ?
9759	2071	Seriously , 's not rhetorical ASPECT_QUESTION .
9760	2071	Who are you going to believe ?

9762	2073	Youngster , , , , , , , ASPECT_THOUSANDS_, , , , , , , , ASPECT_, , Maybe millions of very definitive ASPECT_STATEMENTS were made by scientists , writers , reporters , mathematicians , farmers , etc. ASPECT_ETC. .
9763	2073	Definitive ASPECT_STATEMENTS on about ASPECT_SUBJECT_IMAGINABLE .
9764	2073	All before ASPECT_PRESENT_ridiculous `` ASPECT_AGE of ASPECT_POLITICAL_CORRECTNESS .

9766	2073	`` fact that have stones to make ASPECT_STATEMENT_TODAY , does not mean that FACT was not commonly done in past .
9767	2074	Hey , I 'm not saying that scientists are n't just as human as everyone else .
9768	2074	We have bad ASPECT_TENDENCY to overstate ASPECT_WE_CERTAINTY at times , including I .
9769	2074	But ASPECT_BASIC_PRINCIPLES of ASPECT_SCIENTIFIC_METHOD have been firmly established for centuries .
9770	2074	And there 's big ASPECT_DIFFERENCE between what scientist may say in casual ASPECT_CONVERSATION , or even when being interviewed by reporter , and what ASPECT_SCIENTISTS put in SCIENTISTS ASPECT_FORMAL_ARTICLES for ASPECT_PEER_reviewed ASPECT_PUBLICATIONS .
9771	2074	There is no as absolute ASPECT_CERTAINTY , ever .
9772	2074	None of YOU are infallible , and YOU believe things now will later turn out to be wrong .
9773	2074	You ASPECT_SCIENTIST , everyone .
9774	2074	And science is in business of not only being aware of ASPECT_INHERENT_UNCERTAINTY in life , but to actually quantify BUSINESS .
9775	2074	And uncertainty YOU have in reality of climate ASPECT_CHANGE is now really really small .
9776	2074	I mean , think about UNCERTAINTY - is Pentagon in habit of chasing after latest intellectual ASPECT_FAD ?
9777	2074	If military takes climate ASPECT_CHANGE seriously enough to devote significant ASPECT_RESOURCES to planning for ASPECT_MILITARY_EFFECTS , do n't you think that maybe you should take MILITARY seriously too ?
9778	2075	I know what you mean , old ASPECT_PEOPLE are really dumb in America , and PEOPLE tend to be very politically correct when AMERICA comes to Israel .

9782	2079	At point in time before 2008 ASPECT_MISTAKE , 23 unbelievable ASPECT_INCOMPETENCE , obamalama had not announced 23 was running to destroy presidency .
9783	2081	Yes , Republicans have ASPECT_TALL_ORDER to fill , but with Obama still at helm , and Reid still in charge of Senate , ORDER will most likely be gridlock , which is not so bad when you look at Obama agenda .
9784	2081	There is still plenty of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_FACE in Washington .
9785	2081	Not of cards are in hands of Republicans .
9786	2083	DanNO40 is just another disgruntled , ASPECT_MILITARY_RETIREE who , like drunk ASPECT_SAILOR , regurgitates SAILOR slurred , negative ASPECT_COMMENTS lack ASPECT_SUBSTANCE_and ASPECT_SOURCES for authenticity .
9787	2083	IOW , IOW mostly opinion and fetid hot ASPECT_AIR .

9790	2083	FAN am not .
9791	2083	But , considering unnecessary ASPECT_CONCESSIONS Obama has made to get ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_SUPPORT , FAN now concede that Obama probably will be ASPECT_ONE-TERM_PRESIDENT .
9792	2083	Day-by-day , -LRB- recent ASPECT_PAY_FREEZE on ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_GOVERNMENT_EMPLOYEES_INSURES that ASPECT_OVERWORKED_, understaffed ASPECT_AGENCIES will NOT be able to enforce ASPECT_CURRENT_LAW , let alone that Congress passes . -RRB-

9795	2083	ASPECT_PROBABLE_REPUBLICAN to win nomination in 2012 is ASPECT_JEB_BUSH .

9797	2086	blind drunken ASPECT_LEMMING well beyond 100 supportive of incompetent ASPECT_OBAMALAMA denies that OBAMALAMA is completely brainwashed ASPECT_SUPPORTER of ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_IDIOT no matter what ASPECT_SUPPORTER fxxks up now and forever , accuses OBAMALAMA of `` ASPECT_SLURRED_COMMENTS ?
9798	2086	You may find ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_COMMENTS NOT to your ASPECT_LIKING but they are certainly not ` slurred .
9799	2086	` And as proof of your mindless ASPECT_SUPPORT in spite of facts to contrary , REPUBLICAN cite your ASPECT_STATEMENT , unnecessary ASPECT_CONCESSIONS Obama has made to get ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_SUPPORT , .
9800	2086	incompetent idiot ASPECT_OBAMALAMA has made NO ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_EFFORTS other than ASPECT_LIP_SERVICE to words .
9801	2086	of his ASPECT_ACTIONS have been completely leftist ASPECT_PARTISANSHIP_ACTIONS .
9802	2086	OBAMALAMA has made NO ASPECT_CONCESSIONS , no ASPECT_COMPROMISES , no ASPECT_NEGOTIATIONS .
9803	2086	OBAMALAMA has asked that Republicans -LRB- and REPUBLICAN 'm NOT ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_-RRB- to show bi-partisanship by capitulating and agreeing with ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_IDIOCY .
9804	2086	is what ASPECT_LEFT_WING_IDIOTS see as ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_EFFORT .

9807	2086	Democrats have been coerced , bribed , and earmarked into voting for what OBAMALAMA wanted .
9808	2086	Do NOT try to blame of bills passed 2 ASPECT_YEARS on Republicans .
9809	2086	blame is totally Democrat .
9810	2086	Since ASPECT_JAN._3 ASPECT_2007 , ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY has had and does have until ASPECT_JAN_2011 , control of both ASPECT_HOUSES of Congress .
9811	2086	Republicans could neither vote bill down nor block vote on bill since 1\/3\/2007 .
9812	2086	And to finalize your utter ASPECT_WRONGNESS .
9813	2086	REPUBLICAN am retired and REPUBLICAN did serve in ASPECT_MILITARY_AND am honorably discharged .
9814	2086	But REPUBLICAN 'm retired ASPECT_BUSINESSMAN , not retired ASPECT_MILITARY_OFFICER .
9815	2086	REPUBLICAN served honorably and well and then moved on with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_LIFE .

9830	2091	FAN reproduce ASPECT_FAN_original ASPECT_POST so that there is no ASPECT_DOUBT about what FAN said before one reads DanNO40 post , quoted above .
9831	2091	First , if DanNO was ASPECT_MILITARY_OFFICER , FAN now understand why ASPECT_CURRENT_CROP -LRB- over 60 ASPECT_YEARS -RRB- of ASPECT_MILITARY_OFFICERS are ASPECT_IDEALOGICAL_PURITANS compared to led us after WWII .
9832	2091	ASPECT_CURRENT_HORSE_HOCKEY_RAMPAGE over DADT is indicative of bigotry and ASPECT_INTOLERANCE -LRB- and perhaps , `` homophobia fears OFFICERS conceal in ASPECT_OFFICERS_HEARTS -RRB- ASPECT_18TH_century ASPECT_IDEOLOGUES have instilled in minds of lay ASPECT_PUBLIC at large .
9833	2091	If gays of either ASPECT_GENDER are openly accepted , ASPECT_GAYS_inappropriate ASPECT_SEXUAL_BEHAVIOR will be no condoned\/tolerated than of inappropriate ASPECT_HETEROSEXUAL_BEHAVIOR .
9834	2091	To quote popular ASPECT_PRESIDENT , `` GAYS have to fear but fear ASPECT_BEHAVIOR !
9835	2091	`` As for DanNO claim to be businessman , PRESIDENT 'd say ASPECT_BUSINESS_COMMUNITY behavior since WWII is about which to be proud , i.e. systematic `` ASPECT_BUBBLE to `` burst to recession and ASPECT_SUBSEQUENT_CLIMATIC_DOWNWARD_SPIRAL for ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS .
9836	2091	Reciting figures to prove slide is reported daily in ASPECT_NEWSPAPER_OP-ED , so to quote SLIDE again here is redundant .
9837	2091	In response to : -LRB- RevAnarchist would be wonderful Jollee , and there are libertarians at heart run as republicans .
9838	2091	As you know , Libertarians are for less big ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AND want ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_RESPONSIBILITY .
9839	2091	FAN beleive instead of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAMS ASPECT_LOCAL_COMMUNITY especially church should provide for in need .
9840	2091	Of course -LRB- ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_-RRB- ASPECT_SAFETY_NET should be available for working poor and ASPECT_SINGLE_MOMS , who are high on ASPECT_FAN_respect ASPECT_LIST , very high !
9841	2091	Maybe with enough ASPECT_PRAYER_and ASPECT_WORK ASPECT_ELECTABLE_CANDIDATE may emerge .
9842	2091	There are good ASPECT_REPUBLICANS and couple may be electable with right ASPECT_POLITICAL_MACHINE behind REPUBLICANS .
9843	2091	media , especially cesspools like MSNBC attack conservative ASPECT_CANDIDATES as well as sitting ASPECT_PRESIDENTS_and ASPECT_MEMBERS of ASPECT_CONGRESS_ETC. .
9844	2091	CANDIDATES ruined Palin with well crafted propagandist hack ASPECT_JOB capitalized on ASPECT_PALINS_INEXPERIENCE and her unpolished ASPECT_POLITICAL_PERSONA .
9845	2091	ASPECT_HER_LACK of nonsensical ASPECT_KNOWLEDGE was used as ambush to further discredit ASPECT_HER through no ASPECT_FAULT of HER .
9846	2091	However Palin is accomplished intelligent and good ASPECT_POLITICIAN , HER simply had ASPECT_MEAN_powerful ASPECT_GROUPS against ASPECT_HER_and ASPECT_GROUPS hurt HER .
9847	2091	Personally FAN think GROUPS -LRB- MSNBC of ASPECT_MEDIA_ETC_-RRB- ASPECT_PROPAGANDA and hack job was repugnant and demonstrated how low ASPECT_GROUPS would go to smear that GROUPS did not like , namely ASPECT_WHITE_christian ASPECT_WOMAN .
9848	2091	Maybe ASPECT_KARMA_POLICE will pay GROUPS back in full .
9849	2091	Hey we can hope and pray for justice eh Jollee ?
9850	2091	ASPECT_REV_-RRB- ASPECT_FAN have one to say : FAN categorically disagree with word you posted .
9851	2091	Palin is beauty ASPECT_PAGEANT_AIR_HEAD with penchant , like ASPECT_BRATBOY_BUSH , to appeal to simplistic , ASPECT_FOLKSY_, ASPECT_ANTI-ELITIST_moralistic ASPECT_ATTITUDE of ASPECT_WE_WISH for but never had nor will have .
9852	2091	What you tout is artificial to reality .
9853	2091	TODAY synthetic ASPECT_FLAVORED_ICE-SLUSH with which ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN won Presidency , and PRESIDENCY even less true today than TODAY was then : `` ASPECT_CHURCHES wo n't fill needs for poor and ASPECT_TODAY 's ASPECT_IDEALOGICAL_vagrant ASPECT_GOVERNMENT does n't .
9854	2091	As for your decidedly `` ASPECT_IRREVERENT_and erroneous ASPECT_DESCRIPTION of MSNBC , ASPECT_FAN_DIRECT you to FactCheck.org for lesson in `` truthiness .
9855	2091	POOR provide sources for POOR ASPECT_OBJECTIVE_ANALYSIS .
9856	2091	Fox ASPECT_NEWS does n't cut NEWS !
9857	2091	And , Jolee , FAN have less ASPECT_RESPECT for Libertarians than FAN do for NeoCons , and 's ASPECT_SEVERAL_MARKS below Satan ASPECT_HALF_ACRE in Hell .
9858	2091	ASPECT_RAND_PAUL was named after ASPECT_AYN_RAND whose remarkable ASPECT_WORK was novel , Atlas ASPECT_SHRUGGED .
9859	2091	Do bit of Googling and find out what ASPECT_LIBERTARIANISM is about .

9889	2105	What hell do you mean by `` ASPECT_BIT and what hell is million ASPECT_MINION ?!
9890	2106	Palin is no joke than Dear ASPECT_LEADER_OBAMA .
9891	2106	Hell , ASPECT_CHARLIE_RANGEL could do better ASPECT_JOB than Opie so no ASPECT_VOTE for Messiah in 2012 .
9892	2107	hA hA hA , ASPECT_YOUR_STATEMENT CRACKED ASPECT_ME_UP_GUY !
9893	2107	ASPECT_YOUR_FUNNY !
9895	2108	Your `` ASPECT_THINKING is evidently deeply influenced by your ASPECT_IDEOLOGICAL_BRAINWASHING .
9896	2108	Americans , majority , NOT ASPECT_BRAINWASHED_liberal ASPECT_IDEOLOGUES , are extremely angry at gross ASPECT_INCOMPETENCE and often incredible ASPECT_STUPIDITY of obamalama .
9897	2108	INCOMPETENCE is not disappointment , INCOMPETENCE IS anger .
9898	2108	people disappointed are idiots thought OBAMALAMA had anything to offer in place , ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_DID_NOT .
9899	2108	OBAMALAMA got elected by claiming to be different from Bush .
9900	2108	Turns out OBAMALAMA is different from Bush .
9901	2108	OBAMALAMA worse than Bush .
9902	2108	far ASPECT_OUT from 2008 ASPECT_ELECTION , NOBODY had ever heard of BHO except ASPECT_BHO_PUPPETMASTERS .
9903	2108	So between now and 2012 ASPECT_ELECTIONS ASPECT_DOZEN_or ASPECT_CANDIDATES can appear in limelight .
9904	2108	And if obamalama continues to do as rotten as job as OBAMALAMA has , , , , , , , , , half ASPECT_NEW_CANDIDATES could be liberal ASPECT_DEMOCRATS .
9905	2109	Originally Posted by ASPECT_MEGADETHFAN_VIEW_POST_DAN FOR PRESIDENT I agree with your ASPECT_POST_DAN .
9906	2109	Obama is so stupid OBAMA may think like ASPECT_MEGA_DEATH and think OBAMA can hide ASPECT_OBAMA_LIES and smooth over ASPECT_OBAMA_MISTAKES , and beleive that majority of ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTERS are n't angry with OBAMA ... how in world could VOTERS be mad at golden ASPECT_BOY ?
9907	2109	At messiah ?
9908	2109	Ha ha we will show MESSIAH how angry ASPECT_WE are come ASPECT_ELECTION_TIME !
9909	2109	Hey did you hear that ASPECT_FEDERAL_JUDGE ruled on Monday that Obamacare is unconstitutional ?
9910	2109	I have been saying that along .
9911	2109	I said Obama is stupid , OBAMA is but OBAMA is dangerous stupid like ASPECT_SERIAL_KILLER is dangerous stupid .
9912	2109	DID do not know right from wrong in cases .
9913	2109	is Obama in nutshell -LRB- pun intended ASPECT_-RRB- .
9914	2109	OBAMA thinks OBAMA is doing us favor , when in ASPECT_REALITY_OBAMA is worst has happened to country since another dumb ASPECT_DEMOCRAT ; ASPECT_JIMMY_CARTER .
9915	2109	Carter is better ASPECT_CITIZEN than president .
9917	2110	Mega , what ASPECT_DIRECTION has he shown ?
9918	2110	Bush popularity is getting close to BUSH .
9919	2110	Do you realize if ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE goes down tubes then accomplishment ASPECT_BUSH has 's significant is backing Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS ... ironic , ASPECT_HUH .
9922	2110	Lowden pointed that out ... ASPECT_HERE_LOWDEN ???
9923	2113	It is utterly amazing !!!
9924	2113	Democrats have had control of ASPECT_HOUSE_and ASPECT_SENATE since Jan , 3 .
9926	2113	And retain control until end of year .
9927	2113	Yet in 1095 ASPECT_DAYS they have managed to pass failed ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL .
9928	2113	unconstitutional and horrendous ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL is worst ASPECT_LEGISLATION_EVER considered let alone passed , and THEY have passed ASPECT_BUSINESS_REGULATION_BILL makes ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUSINESS difficult to be in and completely non-competitive with nation anywhere , and you blame conservatives .
9929	2113	Liberal ASPECT_LOONYISM at ASPECT_BILL_BEST .
9930	2113	You had Democrat ASPECT_VOTES to pass ANYTHING , and only accomplished sadly ridiculous ASPECT_BILLS .
9931	2113	conservatives have not had power to pass or STOP anything for nearly 1100 ASPECT_DAYS and you claim ASPECT_DAYS_CONSERVATIVES_FAULT .
9933	2114	Tried ASPECT_AND kicked out of office where have you been ?
9934	2116	Hi ASPECT_BROTHER !
9936	2118	And if he listens to you ASPECT_HE_PRESIDENCY will END !!
9937	2118	Liberalism is evil that conservatives have been compromising with in my ASPECT_LIFETIME .
9938	2118	EVIL is time for to END !
9939	2118	... ... -LRB- How is that for target -RRB- ASPECT_LIVE_CONSERVATISM ... 's right , time ASPECT_BELL_RINGS another ASPECT_LIBERAL is defeated \*\*
9940	2123	Got to be tough when your trying to boost jobs , help your ASPECT_COUNTRY and hide COUNTRY from your ASPECT_BASE ... Dear ASPECT_GOD ...
9941	2124	What do you mean ?
9942	2125	Well if Obama wants to keep his ASPECT_JOB_HIS may have to make deals in private that HIS ASPECT_LEFT_BASE might not agree with , so to prevent them from getting to upset back ASPECT_ROOM_DEALS with ASPECT_REPUB_or ASPECT_CORP._FIGURES may be essential .
9943	2125	ASPECT_CERTAIN_GUARANTEES in words .
9944	2125	I 'm not saying is bad , but smart ASPECT_POLITICS .
9945	2125	HIS knows creating jobs is how HIS will have best ASPECT_CHANCE at ASPECT_RE_ELECTION , I 'm sure played big ASPECT_PART in HIS extending ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
9946	2125	Good for HIS , but left was not very happy .
9947	2128	's very liberal ASPECT_ATTITUDE .
9948	2128	No , one should simply restrain ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INTERVENTION in market altogether .
9949	2128	government should n't be giving money to big or small ASPECT_BUSINESSES nor to individuals .
9950	2129	Obama has BASICALLY ASPECT_CONVERTED to right ASPECT_WING_CONSERVATISM , biggie obviously being extended Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS .
9951	2129	`` What ASPECT_CONVERSION by obamalama .
9952	2129	CAPITULATION was and complete ASPECT_CAPITULATION by Republicans misreading ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPINION as Deomcrats have done since 2007 .
9953	2129	ASPECT_DEOMCRATS_GOT_DEOMCRATS_UNFUNDED unemployment ASPECT_EXTENSION , AND UNFUNDED ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY in exchange for extending Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS which with mini-brain KNEW was going to happen anyway .
9954	2129	And ASPECT_DEMS_DID_NOT_CARE if CARE happened or not , NOT were only posturing time .
9955	2129	If Repubs had cajones , NOT would have called bluff and said ASPECT_TAX_CUTS_EXTENSION_PERIOD , NO ASPECT_DEALS .
9956	2129	NO ASPECT_WAY were Dems going to allow 50 ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE on ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS .
9957	2129	100 ASPECT_CERTAIN , NOT would have caved .
9958	2129	Chances are ASPECT_112TH_CONGRESS will be just as stupid as ASPECT_110TH_, and ASPECT_111TH were .
9959	2131	If ASPECT_LEFT_WING_MEDIA would ignore Palin , she would just fade away .
9960	2131	But they can not avoid taking advantage of obvious whipping ASPECT_GIRL .
9961	2131	easier to trash Palin than do ASPECT_REPORTING_WORK and find story .
9962	2131	Diplomatic ASPECT_SKILLS ???
9963	2131	skills have made obamalama and US laughing ASPECT_STOCK of world .
9964	2131	BHO has been absolutely rejected by nation in ASPECT_EVERYTHING_BHO has proposed .
9965	2131	ASPECT_BHO_international ASPECT_ACCOMPLISHMENTS total exactly ASPECT_ZERO .
9966	2131	At home , BHO has been president since 1\/20\/09 , yet BHO continues to campaign to BE president .
9967	2131	And BHO has already announced that in 2011 ASPECT_BHO will be spending less ASPECT_TIME in DC and time throughout USA .
9968	2131	To interpret that for you , means even ASPECT_CAMPAIGNING and less ASPECT_GOVERNING .
9969	2131	BHO is very good at campaigning , so BHO does .
9970	2131	BHO is very bad at being CEO , so BHO avoids .
9971	2132	I agree that Palin should be ignored .
9973	2132	-LRB- I am conservative -RRB- ASPECT_OBAMA has done amazing ASPECT_JOB in ASPECT_MENDING_FENCES with countries .
9974	2132	America is no longer considered reckless ASPECT_BULLY .
9975	2133	Cant keep good ASPECT_POSTER down aye ?
9976	2133	... LOL Makes sense to me , problem being there are so uninformed ASPECT_PEOPLE out there and 's what POSTER plays too .
9977	2133	So if economy improves PEOPLE will give POSTER credit , what has to be done is make sure that people get reminded is guy that we had at start .
9978	2133	ASPECT_POSTER_BASIC_STRIPES have not changed , and pushing and ASPECT_FIGHTING with right over ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE should remind PEOPLE of .
9979	2133	ME think would be smart of Repubs to keep ASPECT_OBAMA_CARE , border , ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABIES all up front .
9980	2133	If REPUBS gets elected for another ASPECT_TERM_TERM will turn into another ASPECT_SPEND thon .
9981	2134	If you do n't like ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABIES , change Constitution and statutes .
9982	2135	ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABIES came to be by Constitutional ASPECT_AMENDMENT , not by inclusion in original ASPECT_CONSTITUTION .
9983	2135	And Amendment was intended to cover babies of slaves brought to country against BABIES will .
9984	2135	It was not intended to cover people that ASPECT_SMUGGLED_BABIES into country illegally .
9985	2136	Now America is considered foolish and naive ASPECT_PATSY .
9986	2136	We were considered foolish and naive back in 30 too .
9987	2136	How 'd turn out ?
9988	2137	I go with ... I think Legal ASPECT_IMMIGRATION is important to countries and they should have ASPECT_OPEN_ARMS to people .
9989	2137	But what is biggest ASPECT_THREAT to legal ASPECT_IMMIGRATION ?
9990	2137	, illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRATION 's what .
9991	2137	Illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRATION robs us of truly worthy ASPECT_IMMIGRANT and rewards illegal ASPECT_ONE ... ONE 'S THREAT TO EVERYBODY .
9992	2137	I resent fact that country thinks so little of honest ASPECT_IMMIGRANT .
9993	2137	What does say about US ?
9994	2137	ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABY IS NOTHING MORE THAN PRODUCT OF ILLEGAL ASPECT_IMMIGRANT .
9995	2137	They say , well PRODUCT not BABY fault .
9996	2137	Well PRODUCT 's not ours !
9997	2137	, and should have no ASPECT_RIGHTS .
9998	2139	Obama is definitely running again and wo n't be challenged .
9999	2139	As far as GOP is concerned , solid ASPECT_BET is ASPECT_ROMNEY_and ASPECT_GINGRINCH .
10000	2139	I do n't think ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN will run at .
10001	2139	I 'm not sure about rest of ASPECT_GOP_CANDIDATES ...
10002	2140	No , is pack of lies !
10003	2140	BULLY 're still bully as before !
10004	2141	Who told you that ?
10005	2141	issue was hardly that Japan thought US would be quiky .
10006	2141	Roosevelt was thirsting for war , and did everything in ASPECT_ROOSEVELT_POWER to provoke ISSUE -LRB- as Congress was staunchly ASPECT_ISOLATIONIST_-RRB- .
10007	2141	To quote ASPECT_UNITED_STATES_GENERAL_HUGH_JOHNSON : `` JOHNSON know of no ASPECT_WELL informed ASPECT_WASHINGTON_OBSERVER who is n't convinced that , if ASPECT_MR._ROOSEVELT is elected -LRB- in 1940 ASPECT_-RRB- , ROOSEVELT will drag YOU into war at opportunity , and that , if none presents 1940 , ROOSEVELT will make one .
10008	2141	`` JOHNSON was n't so concerned with Japan , but rather ASPECT_HITLER and seized upon opportunity Axis ' ASPECT_TRIPARTITE_AGREEMENT afforded .
10009	2141	JOHNSON actually tried to maneuver Admirals into full out blockade of ASPECT_JAPANESE_SHIPPING at one ASPECT_POINT , but naturally protested ASPECT_VIGOROUSLY and idea was dropped .
10010	2141	So JOHNSON had to settle for ASPECT_OIL_EMBARGOS -LRB- which ASPECT_OBSERVER_fully ASPECT_SUPPORT , by way , but 's neither here nor there -RRB- .
10011	2141	No ASPECT_ONE is going to be attacking America , nation of over 300 million ASPECT_PEOPLE and size of ASPECT_EUROPEAN_CONTINENT , nation which has strongest ASPECT_ARMY , airforce , and navy known , nation that hosts UN and worlds financial ASPECT_HEADQUARTERS .
10012	2141	No ASPECT_MATTER how you spin ONE , America can not look like pansy .
10013	2141	ONE is simply impossible .
10014	2141	Of course , is terribly ASPECT_INCONVENIENT to alarmist neo-conservatives and YOU much touted `` ASPECT_PREEMPTIVE_defense ASPECT_MEASURES .
10015	2142	You might think about : ASPECT_RUDY_GIULIANIMIKE_HUCKABEEJEB_BUSHCHARLIE_CRISTRON_PAULJOHN_BOEHNER
10016	2143	Paul is one I would vote for .
10017	2143	I would sooner see Huckabee gunned down than PAUL hind end in ASPECT_OVAL_OFFICE .
10018	2143	I hate man ; HUCKABEE ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_ZEALOT bearing face of woodchuck -- what could be worse ?
10019	2143	And god forbid we get another ASPECT_BUSH in office ... would be disaster of monstrous ASPECT_PROPORTIONS .
10020	2143	Crist is schmuck and Giullani is just odd .
10021	2144	Are you saying that attack on World ASPECT_TRADE_CENTER did not happen ?
10022	2144	Or that successful ASPECT_ATTACK on target on 9\/11 did not happen either .
10023	2144	Or ASPECT_TENNIS_SHOE_BOMBER and ASPECT_UNDERWEAR_BOMBERS are fiction too ?
10024	2144	Who made up ASPECT_PRINTER_CARTRIDGE_BOMBS ?
10025	2144	alarmist , neo-conservatives ?
10026	2144	Or that Korea or Iran is not insane enough to attack us .
10027	2144	And attack on US was unthinkable , ASPECT_BY_US , in 30 too .
10028	2144	But Japan thought that ASPECT_SINGLE_devastating ASPECT_BLOW would cause US to sue for peace .
10029	2144	Germany was sinking ships right off US ASPECT_COAST , that in case you were unaware , is Act of War .
10030	2144	And who told me ??
10031	2144	One of us , evidently not you , was alive then .
10032	2144	ME guess ONE was ME .
10033	2144	old ASPECT_FART .
10034	2145	I do n't see Guiliani running again , not with conservative ASPECT_UPSWING .
10035	2145	ASPECT_MIKE_HUCKABEE_MIGHT .
10036	2145	Bush I do n't know .
10037	2145	ASPECT_CHARLIE_CRIST will most certainly not run after CRIST left party to run as independent .
10038	2145	ASPECT_RON_PAUL might , but PAUL old and will be nonexistent in terms of ASPECT_PRIMARY_RESULTS like PAUL was in 2008 .
10039	2145	And why would ASPECT_JOHN_BOEHNER run when BOEHNER about to become Speaker again ?
10040	2145	Maybe BOEHNER 'll consider 2008 in 2016 .
10041	2146	What are you on about ?
10042	2146	ATTACK never denied that attacks occurred on ASPECT_UNITED_STATES -LRB- although , to suggest that disgruntled ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL wielding ASPECT_PRINTER_CARTRIDGES is `` ASPECT_ATTACK on ASPECT_SOVEREIGN_SOIL is , shall we say , unique ASPECT_VIEWPOINT_-RRB- .
10043	2146	Why were ASPECT_GERMAN_sinking ASPECT_WE_SHIPS ?
10045	2146	Why did Japan attack ?
10046	2146	WE cut off ASPECT_OIL_SUPPLIES .
10047	2146	ATTACK 'm not denying of occurred .
10048	2146	Nor am ATTACK attempting to argue that Axis used methods differing from above when attacking US .
10049	2146	What ASPECT_ATTACK am saying , however , is that ASPECT_WE_INVOLVEMENT in WWII was not because rest of world thought WE were `` pansies .
10050	2146	INVOLVEMENT would be analogous to attacking even better ASPECT_ARMED_CHINA , rising ASPECT_MILITARY_and ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POWER of time , on virtue of them being perceived as `` weak .
10051	2146	Obviously no ASPECT_SENTIMENTS like exist today ; was case in 1938 as ASPECT_WELL .
10052	2146	To suggest otherwise ASPECT_IS ludicrous .
10053	2147	Sure I will !!
10054	2148	Yes correct , churches should get of it !
10056	2150	I think ASPECT_HUGO_CHAVEZ has issue about ASPECT_NATURAL-BORN_CITIZENSHIP to contend with .
10057	2150	In order for I to seriously considering voting for Obama , Republicans would have to nominate like ASPECT_CHARLIE_MANSON - although I might consider ASPECT_CHARLES_MANSON and ASPECT_MICHAEL_Savage ASPECT_GOP_TICKET .
10058	2150	ORDER could n't be much worse then what we 've got , and they might actually surprise WE - much like ASPECT_JESSE_VENTURA did as governor of Minnesota !
10059	2152	as ASPECT_AND how so ?
10060	2153	years ago when south ASPECT_FLORIDA was struck with horrible ASPECT_HURRICANES , I remember watching TV and there was ASPECT_JEB_BUSH , I believe governor of Florida at time .
10061	2153	I was actually quite surprised to learn that BUSH could talk well , BUSH could formulate pertinent and interesting ASPECT_COMMENTS , BUSH was n't reading from ASPECT_NOTES_or ASPECT_TELEPROMPTERS , BUSH was poised and mature , BUSH was in command , BUSH shared stage with emergency ASPECT_PERSONNEL , on important ASPECT_STUFF_BUSH spoke fluently in ASPECT_ENGLISH_and ASPECT_SPANISH ... and ... BUSH had no resemblance or ASPECT_QUIRKINESS to Bush ASPECT_SR_and ASPECT_JR. .
10063	2153	. true ASPECT_FATHER must have been ASPECT_MILK_MAN with higher ASPECT_IQ !
10064	2153	I do n't know anything else about FATHER but on day and during week I was quite impressed ...
10065	2154	My ASPECT_GUESS is of MY named will entertain idea of running for president because they believe THEY have ` right ' ASPECT_ANSWERS to complex ASPECT_PROBLEMS and ASPECT_THEY_EGOS are large enough to fill Oprah ASPECT_PANTS_SUIT .
10066	2154	In ASPECT_POLITICS_EGOS rule day ...
10067	2155	Truthfully ... Obama was least qualified and least experienced ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE in recent ASPECT_HISTORY .
10068	2155	Why would be surprised if person lacking appropriate ASPECT_CREDENTIALS might fail to live up to expectations ?
10069	2155	I blame Obama for being so arrogant to believe PERSON was qualified to run for president ... but I blame voters for being so fricken stupid when VOTERS enter voting ASPECT_BOOTH .
10070	2155	Until ASPECT_IGNORANCE_and ASPECT_PERSONAL_BIAS wanes about ASPECT_1000 , I suspect we will continue to elect ASPECT_LESS-THAN-QUALIFIED_CANDIDATES to Congress and presidency ...
10071	2156	What you have been saying is that no ASPECT_ONE would dare attack us .
10072	2156	is dumbest ASPECT_HEAD-IN-THE-SAND_POSITION that could possibly take .
10073	2156	ONE 've pointed out to you that POSITION has happened to US before .
10074	2156	You try to excuse prior ASPECT_ATTACKS by claiming US were complicit in ASPECT_US_ATTACKS .
10075	2156	DOES ASPECT_NOT_MATTER even if true .
10076	2156	US were still attacked and if you 're crazy enough to believe US will not be attacked again , you invite attack .
10077	2157	Which it is , of course ; and yes COURSE does , of course .
10078	2157	is akin to saying , `` One must walk around YES ASPECT_HOME with hardhat on because ONE might collapse -- has happened to me before !
10079	2157	True , ME never got around to building that ASPECT_FOURTH_WALL ... but you never know !
10080	2157	Why would be attacking YOU without reason ?
10081	2157	Nobody is saying scrap navy and airforce .
10082	2157	Quite ASPECT_CONTRARY .
10083	2157	Either ASPECT_WAY , you 're not really addressing issue .
10084	2157	You stated that ASPECT_UNITED_STATES came under attack because we were considered weak .
10085	2157	is both patently erroneous and demonstrably ASPECT_UNTRUE .
10086	2159	You 're defending incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN , I 'm defending history .
10087	2159	You 're welcome to your ASPECT_OPINION , I 'll keep mine .
10088	2160	If CHRISTIAN were not christian ASPECT_CHRISTIAN would hope for fate to befall Obama .
10089	2160	CHRISTIAN am truly surprised FATE has n't happened -LRB- yet ASPECT_-RRB- .
10090	2160	So much for scary ASPECT_WHITE_SUPREMACISTS !
10091	2160	Heck , radical -LRB- black -RRB- Muslims do dirty to black ASPECT_LEADERS of ASPECT_NOTE_HECK seems .
10092	2160	Barnyism ' was n't reason CHRISTIAN did n't vote for Obama , neither was ASPECT_OBAMA_COLOR , well except for yellow ASPECT_STRIPE running up ASPECT_OBAMA_SPINE .
10093	2160	No ASPECT_OBAMAS liberal ASPECT_IDEAS -LRB- ie abortion -RRB- , gross ASPECT_IGNORANCE of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_AFFAIRS , and lack of ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_EXPERIENCE are of defects which disqualify OBAMA as ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL .
10094	2160	CHRISTIAN do n't consider ASPECT_PERSONAL_APPEARANCE when voting for man , if CHRISTIAN said why is so , CHRISTIAN may get infraction .
10095	2160	Anyway , look at Obama , OBAMA looks like cross between ASPECT_BARNEY_FIFE and Dumbo with ears .
10096	2160	As for ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_GUYS in office , relax as long as GUYS are christian you have to worry about .
10097	2160	Look at history ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_PRESIDENTS have been popular and ASPECT_BEST .
10098	2160	atheist as president !
10099	2160	Ha ha much worse !
10100	2160	Truly , your ASPECT_OPINIONS of what represents good ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL is horrifying .
10102	2161	Whilst I agree in part , his ASPECT_OPPONENTS were far worse .
10103	2161	Now in retrospect YOU can see Obama has actually continued many of failed ASPECT_POLICIES of ASPECT_OBAMA_PREDECESSOR .
10104	2161	So you vote on looks ?
10105	2161	Actually if are Christian you have crap ASPECT_LOAD to worry about - so does rest of world .
10108	2161	LOL is so ignorant , but says lot about you Rev. How so ?
10110	2162	I have read several of your ASPECT_POSTS .
10111	2162	You seem to be too concerned as to why happened .
10112	2162	If nut broke in your ASPECT_HOME and shot your ASPECT_FAMILY would your have to ask why NUT happened before you eliminated threat ?
10113	2162	Just curious .
10114	2162	ASPECT_~_REV ~
10115	2164	PRINCIPLE very ASPECT_SIMPLE_PRINCIPLE known as ASPECT_CAUSE_and ASPECT_EFFECT .
10116	2164	They are mutually inclusive ; one can not exist without .
10117	2164	International ASPECT_POLITICS are not as simple as disgruntled ASPECT_ROBBER .
10118	2164	Which ASPECT_ONE has n't been Christian ?
10119	2164	What horribly constructed ASPECT_ARGUMENT .
10120	2164	ONE 'm not even sure how to deal with ... 's not like Christians have ever gotten US involved in illegitimate ASPECT_WARS , and US not as if SERVANTS 've ever infringed upon ASPECT_CIVIL_LIBERTIES .
10121	2164	Nor is likely that ASPECT_SINGLE_Christian ASPECT_PRESIDENT has ever crafted ASPECT_SINGLE_POLICY in error .
10122	2164	You see , SERVANTS 're servants of Lord .
10123	2164	SERVANTS can do no ASPECT_WRONG .
10124	2164	Yes , god forbid rational ASPECT_PERSON find PERSON in office .
10125	2164	As you well know , we non-practicing heathens dream of ASPECT_MARXIST_UTOPIAS in which Muslims actually have ASPECT_RIGHTS_and ASPECT_PEOPLE abort children for fun .
10126	2164	What is ASPECT_NEW_JERUSALEM_NONSENSE ?
10127	2164	You 've been watching too ASPECT_HISTORY ASPECT_MYSTERIES_EPISODES .
10128	2164	Regarding second ASPECT_QUESTION , about which ASPECT_TYPE of ASPECT_LEADER_ONE would prefer : ONE would spring for ASPECT_AYN_RAND .
10130	2164	ASPECT_WHOSE_DEFENDING ?
10131	2164	ASPECT_SINCEREST_APOLOGIES , but revisionism does n't count .
10132	2165	Why do you not vote .
10133	2165	If it is because of apathy , then why not support ASPECT_FALGAFT_PLAN ???
10134	2165	Is IT not ASPECT_TIME that ASPECT_US_CITIZEN took back control of country .
10135	2166	Nor is International ASPECT_POLITICS as simple as ASPECT_CAUSE_and ASPECT_EFFECT which depends on logic , far from anything remotely applicable to international ASPECT_POLITICS .
10136	2166	ASPECT_HA_HA .
10137	2166	IP are more like ASPECT_QM_or Chaos ASPECT_THEORY in nature .
10138	2166	You expressed doubt that ASPECT_AMERICAN_PRESIDENTS were christian , CHRISTIAN was simply attempting to get you to support your ASPECT_UNSUBSTANTIATED_CLAIMS .
10139	2166	Answer question and please do n't quit YOU ASPECT_DAY_JOB for stand up comedy , you will starve 's why you self described `` ASPECT_NON-PRACTICING_HEATHENS_DREAM of ASPECT_MARXIST_UTOPIAS in which Muslims actually have ASPECT_RIGHTS_and ASPECT_PEOPLE abort children for fun will never make president , thank God .
10140	2166	BTW , abortions are n't for fun , but rather nearly as sinister and repulsive , CHILDREN are performed for convenience of mom and ASPECT_DAD .
10141	2166	Nah , CHRISTIAN ASPECT_THEORIES are different than history mysteries etc. .
10142	2166	kinds of pseudo educational ASPECT_CHANNELS injects too artistic ASPECT_LICENSE into CHILDREN ASPECT_DOCTRINE .
10143	2166	CHRISTIAN am christian and ASPECT_PROPHESY is clear , btw there will be ASPECT_NEW_JERUSALEM_one ASPECT_DAY as well as ASPECT_NEW_TEMPLE_ETC. .
10144	2166	Just as ASPECT_SURE as ASPECT_NEW_ISRAEL came into existence as per bible ASPECT_PROPHESY .
10145	2166	One ASPECT_NEED not watch anti christian ASPECT_HISTORY_CHANNEL , to read bible to determine facts and what is to be .
10146	2166	Well you could of picked much worse .
10147	2166	ASPECT_RANDS_OBJECTIVISM seems bit like libertarianism , maybe MOTHER was mother of liberalism so MOTHER may be ok .
10149	2167	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- I 'd become Republican if Republicans nominated ASPECT_HUGO_CHAVEZ .
10150	2168	Actually , fundamentally , it is .
10151	2168	's IT is .
10152	2168	IT just happens to be incredibly convoluted and impossible to discern which ASPECT_RIPPLES will affect what .
10153	2168	But idea is to formulate projections and , subsequently , manipulate as best as is possible .
10155	2168	I 've done no ... It appears you 've forgotten there was no ASPECT_QUESTION ; rather , just ill-conceived ASPECT_STATEMENT .
10156	2168	And I was n't being humorous ; I was being sardonic .
10157	2168	There is distinct ASPECT_DIFFERENCE .
10158	2169	-LRB- quote = Plymouth ; 3291039 -RRB- Actually , fundamentally , QUOTE is .
10159	2169	's QUOTE is .
10160	2169	QUOTE just happens to be incredibly convoluted and impossible to discern which ASPECT_RIPPLES will affect what .
10161	2169	But idea is to formulate projections and , subsequently , manipulate as best as is possible .
10162	2169	Sorry maybe was MD ?
10163	2169	you ASPECT_OUTSIDERS look to me ... Ok , is going to be ME post today .
10164	2169	ME am tired and obvious by ASPECT_ME_TYPO_ETS .
10166	2169	ASPECT_HA_HA .
10168	2169	ME mean etc .
10169	2169	Again your ASPECT_REPLY -LRB- after paragraph and ASPECT_ME_TYPO -RRB- has no ASPECT_SUBSTANCE , REPLY about ASPECT_PERSONAL_BS will be filed as .
10170	2169	ME was using ASPECT_DUAL_SLIT_EXPERIMENT as analogy .
10171	2169	analogy demonstrated that we can know to degree of probability which slit particle will take .
10172	2169	WE know type of probabilities well enough to make calculations and ASPECT_PROBABILISTIC_OUTCOME of calculations are accurate enough to design circuits .
10173	2169	just as ME pointed out .
10174	2169	Nevertheless , even though WE know with exceedingly ASPECT_HIGH_DEGREE which slit particle will take there is still chance that particle will do unexpected and take slit that PARTICLE ` should n't ' according to rules of probability .
10175	2169	circuit may fail if happens .
10176	2169	's bad for circuits but good for people because that ASPECT_TINY_FRACTIONAL_LEE_WAY is room WE require for free ASPECT_WILL to exist .
10177	2169	is because if God knew with accuracy of 100 exactly future and what ASPECT_CHOICES_WE would make ASPECT_WE_free ASPECT_WILL would not , and could not exist .
10179	2170	Id become republican if republicans nominated me for president .
10180	2170	Anyway ~ On ASPECT_UNRELATED_TOPIC we gotta ' love ASPECT_WE_POLL ! -RRB-
10181	2170	Two to one against Nobama , indicates there is intelligent ASPECT_LIFE in forum !
10183	2171	ASPECT_NOMINATION_ONE and counting ...
10184	2172	Started out Terrible ... maybe ASPECT_CHANGE meant -LRB- ASPECT_3RD_,4 th years of ASPECT_PRESIDENCY_-RRB- ?
10185	2172	Hope\/Change = Dope in Charge -LRB- hopefully not -RRB- !
10186	2174	Care too elaborate ?
10188	2175	i simply disagree with majority of his ASPECT_POSITIONS .
10189	2175	i like guy personally , but i do n't see way for GUY to get I vote in 2012 given ASPECT_GUY_POLICIES .
10190	2176	MYSELF could not have said it better myself ... Jollee
10191	2177	Well Duh !
10192	2177	DUH got elected because DUH seemed likable .
10193	2177	DUH did not get elected on DUH ASPECT_EXPERIENCE_or ASPECT_COMPETENCE .
10194	2177	And now realize that , while likable , DUH is neither Chief ASPECT_EXECUTIVE , nor competent .
10195	2177	But DUH still seems likable and still can give ASPECT_HELLUVA_CAMPAIGN_SPEECH .
10196	2177	Trouble is , we do n't need speeches , WE need ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_EXEC can get hard ASPECT_JOBS done .
10197	2177	obamalama ai n't guy !
10198	2178	He 's incompetant !
10199	2179	Ha ha thanks Jollee !
10200	2179	Hey will you be my ASPECT_VICE_PRESIDENT ?
10202	2180	You better believe it !
10203	2180	We will clean place up !
10205	2181	Are you KIDDING ME !!!
10206	2181	ASPECT_REASON_OBAMA chose to extend ASPECT_TAX_CUTS at time is because OBAMA did n't want to be seen as President who presided over biggest ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE in history , and especially during ASPECT_DEEP_RECESSION .
10207	2181	-LRB- What ASPECT_RECOVERY ? -RRB-
10208	2181	Additionally , OBAMA did n't want to wait until ASPECT_NEW_CONGRESS got in place , because ASPECT_OBAMA_KNEW_OBAMA would n't be able to jam CONGRESS through with ASPECT_NEW_TENS of BILLIONS in spending .
10209	2181	Unfortunately , line of ME shows me how ASPECT_LITTLE you actually understand about Conservatism .
10210	2181	Conservatives do n't believe in ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_`` Giving ASPECT_CASH to public , CONSERVATIVES believe in allowing ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR to keep as of ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_EARNINGS as possible .
10211	2181	Can you imagine how much better off Ford -LRB- and GM for matter -RRB- would be if CONSERVATIVES did n't have to pay highest ASPECT_CAPITAL_gain ASPECT_TAXES in world , as CONSERVATIVES do here in good ASPECT_OL US of ?
10212	2181	How cash would CONSERVATIVES have to re-invest in production as CONSERVATIVES European and ASPECT_ASIAN_COMPETITORS are allowed to do ?
10213	2181	Is BETTER wonder that over ASPECT_40K_MANUFACTURING_PLANTS employing average of 500 ASPECT_PEOPLE have closed over past 2 ASPECT_DECADES in U.S. ?
10214	2181	No , ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT should n't be giving anything to , Job should be relegated to ASPECT_LOCAL_or ASPECT_STATE_GOVERNMENTS where there can be tighter ASPECT_LID on accountability , and where NO do n't have ability to `` Magically ASPECT_PRINT_MONEY , thereby reducing value of EVERYONE money .
10215	2181	ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT job should be just 3 ASPECT_THINGS : Guaranteeing ASPECT_PERSONAL_Liberty and ASPECT_FREEDOM -LRB- FBI , CIA , Military and ASPECT_COURT_SYSTEM -RRB- Protecting ASPECT_BORDER_and ASPECT_HANDLING_TRADE -LRB- Customs and ASPECT_BORDER_PATROL -RRB- Provide fair and equitable ASPECT_OPEN_and Free ASPECT_MARKET for States to do business with ASPECT_OTHERTHAT_LIBERTY !!!
10216	2181	EVERYTHING , ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , Welfare , Education , ASPECT_SOCIAL_SERVICES , NO can all be handled by States with greater ASPECT_EFFICIENCY and better ASPECT_RESPONSIVENESS than ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT can .
10217	2183	There are two ASPECT_WAYS to be qualified to be President .
10218	2183	One - have history , legal , and ASPECT_POLITICAL_and savvy ASPECT_CREDENTIALS Presidents have quite ASPECT_BIT of .
10219	2183	ASPECT_OLE_' , ` ASPECT_OLE .
10220	2183	Two - be possessed of almost perfect ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE and be as honest as man can possibly be .
10221	2183	person must be surrounded by sharp ASPECT_ADVISORS .
10222	2183	We have always depended on One to elect ASPECT_WE_PRESIDENTS .
10223	2183	I think TIME time for President with qualifications in Two .
10224	2183	There are couple of males and couple of females might possess .
10225	2183	One in particular .
10226	2184	Sadly we did elect `` Two as ASPECT_WE_PRESENT_PRESIDENT .
10228	2186	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Of course I will .
10229	2186	He 's done fabulous ASPECT_JOB .
10230	2186	And we just ca n't run risk of turning country back over to ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_BRAIN-DEAD_IDEOLOGUES who took perfectly fine ASPECT_ECONOMY and turned ECONOMY into giant ASPECT_BALL of snot in less than 8 ASPECT_YEARS .
10231	2189	No ASPECT_MATTER who is president , no ASPECT_MATTER_HIGH_QUALIFICATIONS , will require ASPECT_SPECIALIZED_ADVISERS ; running ASPECT_US_GOVERNMENT is simply too complex for one ASPECT_PERSON to have complete ASPECT_KNOWLEDGE .
10232	2189	Regarding ` ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE ' ... as long as we have ASPECT_DOMINANT_two ASPECT_PARTY_SYSTEM , and as long as voters are deeply polarized towards one of two ASPECT_PARTIES , ONE is unlikely there will be ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE_PROBLEM solving .
10233	2189	Seems to US , in order to achieve ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE_and ASPECT_WIN-WIN_, ASPECT_ETC. , WE must move away from ASPECT_TWO-PARTY_RULE ...
10234	2190	ASPECT_GM_STOCK is selling at ASPECT_PRICE_STOCK is because GM raised price of additional ASPECT_SHARES being released .
10235	2190	IF ASPECT_NEW_OFFERING works perfectly and Govt sells as shares as GOVT can under ASPECT_NEW_OFFERING , then ASPECT_US_GOVT_STAKE in GM will be reduced from 61 to 33 .
10237	2190	And have no ASPECT_BUSINESS owning 33 of GM just as had no ASPECT_BUSINESS owning 61 .
10238	2190	Vote for Jeb over obamalma could not find time in his ASPECT_SCHEDULE to call parents of fallen ASPECT_SOLDIER after ASPECT_LOCAL_POLITICIAN screwed up ASPECT_CONDOLENCE_LETTER , but could find time to call ASPECT_PHILADELPHIA_EAGLES and congratulate PARENTS for hiring ASPECT_DOG_murderer ASPECT_VICK ?
10239	2190	I will not know until voting ASPECT_TIME who will get I vote .
10240	2190	But obamalama heads list of will NOT be considered .
10241	2191	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- If held RPG to my ASPECT_HEAD .
10242	2192	would depend .
10243	2192	If ASPECT_CHOICE_JEB_BUSH or ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA or else ?
10244	2192	Would you vote for ASPECT_REP._PELOSI in 2012 ?
10245	2192	After , 2010 had absolutely to do with ASPECT_PELOSI_HIGHNESS .
10246	2192	wonder if they 've gotten keys for airplanes from PELOSI yet ?
10248	2194	Better ASPECT_QUESTION , what makes you think Obama is socialist ?
10249	2194	ASPECT_OBAMA_OVERT_SPENDING_ISNT_ORIGINAL .
10250	2194	In terms of fp , OBAMA has n't change much and has done far less damage than ASPECT_OBAMA_PREDECESSOR .
10251	2194	In terms of ASPECT_SOCIAL_POLICIES , OBAMA is progressive , but again not unique .
10252	2194	Socialism requires ASPECT_FUNDAMENTAL_and core ASPECT_IDEAS , namely communal ASPECT_OWNERSHIP of ` ASPECT_MEANS of production ' , which Obama has not slightly indicated moving to .
10253	2194	And of course , along side , eradication of ` ASPECT_PRIVATE_PROPERTY ' as ASPECT_INSTITUTIONALIZED_legal ASPECT_PROCEDURE .
10254	2194	Obama has not even contemplated .
10255	2194	Ah but then you say , ok but OBAMA intends to have world ASPECT_GOVERNANCE - so what ?
10256	2194	ASPECT_OBAMA_DEFINITION of world ASPECT_GOVERNANCE is far different to yours .
10257	2194	OBAMA is of legal ASPECT_STRUCTURE - which for America is rather hard to grasp , but not for Europeans who have learned hard ASPECT_WAY .
10258	2194	In terms of ASPECT_DIRECT_MANAGEMENT_NO_ONE is contemplating , but you are suggesting , in fact loudly purporting that is ASPECT_OBAMA_AIM .
10259	2194	Sorry to say but belief is ignorant to say least .
10260	2194	If will be taking ASPECT_DIRECT_CONTROL of anything , BELIEF will be America do so in countries as AMERICA ruling ASPECT_REGIME seeks to further ASPECT_REGIME_INTERESTS , which REGIME has been doing for over 200 ASPECT_YEARS .
10261	2195	I may think Obama is socialist , but I do n't claim OBAMA is socialist , or ASPECT_RATHER I should say that I do n't mean to make I ASPECT_INNER_TRUTHS and dearly ASPECT_HELD_CONVICTIONS public , purposely .
10264	2195	What bit of twisted ASPECT_GRAMMAR was !
10265	2195	Allow I another ?
10266	2195	; I do mean to , and usually do say that unless wayward ASPECT_FREUDIAN_SLIP encroaches upon I published ASPECT_INTERNET_FONT , I verbiage and presentations will proclaim that Obama merely cleaves heavily to things socialist , and often adopts things which is far more dangerous than even ASPECT_MILITARY_SOLUTION in cases .
10267	2195	issue is n't not how FREUDIAN spent but rather way FREUDIAN spends money .
10268	2195	As I said I am claiming that FREUDIAN is trending towards socialism .
10269	2195	In reality I beleive FREUDIAN was and is setting up necessary ASPECT_CULTURE as preparing ASPECT_WALL_STREET and ` ASPECT_INFRASTRUCTURE ' to allow easy ASPECT_TRANSITION to socialist ASPECT_SYSTEM I would wager you are wrong about !
10270	2195	I am sure ASPECT_FREUDIAN has contemplated dream of world ASPECT_WIDE_SOCIALISM with USA being leading charge down path to ASPECT_NATIONAL_POVERTY or worse !
10271	2195	World ASPECT_GOVERNANCE is world ASPECT_GOVERNANCE .
10272	2195	If FREUDIAN gets ASPECT_FREUDIAN_WAY is inch to mile .
10273	2195	Europeans are currently are paying price for learning that you hold in ASPECT_HIGH_REGARD !
10274	2195	CURRENTLY manifesting as bankrupt ASPECT_ECONOMIES , bankrupt ASPECT_CITIZENS , ASPECT_HUNGRY_PEOPLE , and failures which are resulting in ASPECT_CIVIL_DISOBEDIENCE , protests in streets , and ASPECT_SOCIAL_UNREST !
10275	2195	No ASPECT_CITIZENS Europeans can keep that , including international world ASPECT_COURT .
10276	2195	BTW , we are ASPECT_SOVEREIGN_NATION with Constitution grantees ASPECT_WE_RIGHTS_and ASPECT_SECURITY , additionally constitution does not allow countries to meddle in ASPECT_WE_AFFAIRS .
10277	2195	Obama is naive that seeks to appease instead of having spine .
10278	2195	OBAMA would of spooned with Hitler if was ASPECT_1938 because is what ASPECT_OBAMA_NAIVETY_SOWS , stupidity !
10279	2195	Sadly for ASPECT_WE_CITIZENS , especially OBAMA has duped , OBAMA is dumber than rock despite ASPECT_OBAMA_DEGREE and ASPECT_IVY_LEAGUE_EDUCATION and has and will result in ASPECT_UNTOLD_human ASPECT_MISERY if OBAMA is n't stopped IMO .
10280	2195	Right now damage is not great , however NOW will soon snowball .
10281	2195	WE have time to correct ASPECT_OBAMAS_MISTAKES and TIME appears with ASPECT_GOP_CONGRESS attempting to repeal so called ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL -LRB- another socialist ASPECT_INSTRUMENT -RRB- that WE may save day yet .
10282	2195	So , MD , I hope and pray that WE will get Obama out of office before anything else bad ASPECT_HAPPENS .
10283	2195	God help WE if poo really hits fan !
10284	2195	No ASPECT_GOD is not ASPECT_DIRECT_MANAGER_IMO , GOD is puppet of people with power .
10285	2195	GOD -LRB- by wielding power of ASPECT_USA_-RRB- may be in top three ASPECT_FOURTHS in world ASPECT_POWER , but GOD is simply ASPECT_POWER_BROKER doing bidding either knowingly or with ignorance of people really has power to control economies of nations .
10286	2195	In fact at least ASPECT_ONE of people has said in print that GOD enjoys destroying ASPECT_NATIONAL_ECONOMIES -LRB- or playing game leads up to destroying ASPECT_NATIONS_currency etc ASPECT_-RRB- .
10287	2195	Well , with due ASPECT_RESPECT ignorance you speak of is deposited in piles and ASPECT_HEAPS in your ASPECT_CAMP .
10288	2195	Your ASPECT_COUNTRY exists only because of power of ASPECT_PRE-OBAMA_USA .
10289	2195	Yes COUNTRY way we roll MD. .
10290	2195	Sorry , I do n't want to be citizen of world , nor do I want USA to be ASPECT_NATIONAL_CITIZEN of world .
10291	2195	I want world to leave I and ASPECT_WE_NATION alone and would hope that president has wisdom to help WE achieve isolationism which will allow WE to last thousand ASPECT_YEARS .
10292	2195	If WE instead kiss ASPECT_UNS_BUTT and reelect Obama or clone of Obama USA will cease to exist in less than 50 ASPECT_YEARS IMO .
10293	2195	Look personally I will survive -LRB- in likelihood ASPECT_-RRB- .
10294	2195	However , I would rather survive in world where USA exists in name and in SPIRIT .
10295	2195	reason for is because I love I ASPECT_FELLOW_MAN as I .
10296	2195	I desperately love children who will pay price of living and ASPECT_LIKELY_SUFFERING in world without USA and freedom loving ASPECT_NATIONS .
10297	2195	I for one do n't want to find out , nor do I want I ASPECT_FELLOW_MAN to discover what little ASPECT_SHOP of horrors will -LRB- or may -RRB- be like either .
10299	2197	Yes you have honest ASPECT_POST there .
10300	2197	I am no ASPECT_DIFFERENT and I hate to admit POST !
10301	2197	When I lived in AK in ASPECT_LATE_80 I was making 36 ASPECT_DOLLARS ASPECT_HOUR_TAX free with 200 week for housing as ASPECT_JOURNEYMAN_IRON-WORKER and going to school at University of AK for free at night -LRB- ASPECT_VA_BILL , earning credits for I ASPECT_C._THEOLOGY_MA ASPECT_-RRB- .
10302	2197	I had subcontracted ASPECT_STRUCTURAL_and reinforcing ASPECT_STEEL in ASPECT_PEDESTRIAN_WALKWAY on steel ASPECT_BRIDGE towered near 200ft over bay , but they paid I by hour because I had so miserably underestimated bid .
10303	2197	Great ASPECT_FOLKS ASPECT_SWALLING_CONSTRUCTION -LRB- ASPECT_ANCHORAGE_-RRB- !
10304	2197	So ten ASPECT_HOUR_DAYS I made 360 ASPECT_DOLLARS plus around 50 ASPECT_DOLLARS to eat on and help defer cost of room , or about 1600 ASPECT_TAX_free ASPECT_DOLLARS per four ASPECT_DAY_work ASPECT_WEEK .
10305	2197	Anything over 40 paid ASPECT_DOUBLE_WAGES rather than time and half which was common in states !
10306	2197	I was married .
10307	2197	I wife was E-6 and WIFE earned about half what I did plus WIFE got ASPECT_HOUSING_ETC. and we bought groceries in PX .
10308	2197	Hell no ASPECT_WIFE did n't complain !
10309	2197	I liked money but I was miserable really but is about ASPECT_MONEY eh ?
10310	2197	However I call ASPECT_APPALACHIAN_MOUNTAINS I home and area is poverty ASPECT_CENTRAL of USA .
10311	2197	Today I do n't do ASPECT_IRON_WORK but if I did ASPECT_PREVAILING_WAGE -LRB- what I would pay ASPECT_JOURNEYMAN_IRON-WORKERS on building with ASPECT_FEDERAL_FUNDS -RRB- here is about 20 ASPECT_DOLLARS hour .
10312	2197	In 80 80 was about 10-12 ASPECT_BUCKS hour .
10313	2197	Anyway what I am saying is that we are too comfortable .
10314	2197	trouble is that what happens here usually happens in rest of states in years and one ASPECT_CANT_BUY job here .
10315	2197	I owned small ASPECT_TESTING_LAB and had to sell LAB because not enough ASPECT_PEOPLE was testing soil and I lost ASPECT_STATE_CONTRACT for testing ASPECT_BODILY_FLUIDS for ASPECT_DUI_CASES etc. .
10316	2197	So about three ASPECT_YEARS ago I sold lab and used modest ASPECT_PROFITS to throw I in church and two Christian humanitarian ASPECT_NON_PROFITS I founded .
10317	2197	I broke even year then bottom dropped out when economy tanked .
10318	2197	Even with Obama in office ASPECT_FEDERAL_GRANTS dried up quicker than ASPECT_PERSONAL_DONATIONS , so I was forced to close doors months ago to wait on better ASPECT_TIMES after exhausting I bank account .
10319	2197	Today I make ends meet on small ASPECT_INSURANCE_and ASPECT_INTEREST off investments .
10320	2197	Thank God ASPECT_HOUSE_and ASPECT_LAND is paid for , and I am debt free !
10321	2197	But oh so ASPECT_TALE is true and I hope and pray not coming to OH ` ASPECT_RA
10322	2199	Hey poll actually reflects reality in case !
10323	2199	ASPECT_~_RA ~
10324	2200	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Of course .
10325	2201	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Is n't America great ?
10326	2202	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- He IS dangerous to in America .
10327	2202	I like AMERICA that way .
10328	2204	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ... -RRB- -RRB- ... -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ASPECT_YES , because one disgruntled ASPECT_POSTER on ASPECT_INTERNET_FORUM is wholly representative of country in ONE ASPECT_ENTIRETY .
10329	2204	Do n't you know , I mow down elderly with ASPECT_SHOPPING_CARTS in ASPECT_GROCERY_STORE_PARKING_LOTS -- just for kicks !
10330	2204	I do n't even have ASPECT_POLITICAL_MOTIVATIONS .
10331	2204	What do you think about ?
10332	2206	If obamalama was running unopposed by , ONE 'd write in rather than vote for `` great incompetent ASPECT_ONE .
10333	2208	I dont know , but it sure should not be Obama , pitting one ASPECT_GROUP of people against another ONE ASPECT_UNHEARD of for leader !
10334	2209	What do you mean ?
10335	2210	What quote meant was that he is dangerous to nation of USA .
10337	2211	I hope he does not ever get whole in otitis ASPECT_MEDIA ... liike I Mom did ... WHOLE was treacherous !
10338	2212	He isnt danger to nation at all , rather to whole ASPECT_WORLD , but is no ASPECT_DIFFERENT to ASPECT_PAST_PRESIDENT since WW2 .
10339	2213	Yes , because of patriotic ASPECT_LOVE of country !
10341	2214	LOL Either you are retarded , cant read , or did n't read what I wrote .
10342	2214	Which is ASPECT_EITHER_JOLLEE , because what you just said is totally irrelevant to what I said .
10343	2215	you ARE ASPECT_NOT_JUSTIFIED ... .
10344	2215	take LOOK AT YOURSELF !
10345	2216	What is not justified ?
10346	2216	Oh and I look pretty -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- good when I 'm in mirror
10347	2217	keep ASPECT_REPEATING_YOURSELF , YOU ASPECT_SOUND_LIKE IDIOT !
10349	2218	LOL Is that you have left ?
10351	2218	So you have no ASPECT_ARGUMENT left ?
10352	2218	ASPECT_LOL_TYPICAL_FAILURE .
10353	2219	Were you ever worth it ?
10354	2219	No. ... Jollee
10355	2220	Oh I 'm very worth it - I 'm quite expensive actually
10356	2221	Keep making yourself feel like your ... ASPECT_JOLLEE_HA_HA
10357	2222	Are you jealous Jollee ?
10359	2223	Ah old ASPECT_EAR_TUBE_Granuloma ASPECT_EH ?
10360	2223	Bless ASPECT_AH_HEART .
10361	2223	I dont wish harm to come to even Obama , I do wish they would just go away !
10363	2224	Obama is fine , you need to calm down about ASPECT_OBAMA .
10364	2225	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- I 'm part of nation and I ai n't dangerous to me .
10365	2225	Maybe you should speak for yourself instead of trying to speak for 310,000,000 ASPECT_PEOPLE , eh ?
10366	2226	Another ASPECT_HIGH_MAINTENANCE , Me , ME , Me'er , Just what world needs great ASPECT_DEAL fewer of !
10367	2228	Interesting commentary and heavily weighed in `` ASPECT_SOUTHERN_PHILOSOPHY , SOUTHERN suggest .
10368	2228	SOUTHERN mostly grew up in `` ASPECT_SOUTH but ASPECT_SOUTHERN_higher ASPECT_EDUCATION is midwest where SOUTHERN was taught `` how to think critically , not `` what to think critically , as ASPECT_SOUTHERN_youthful ASPECT_YEARS outlined .
10369	2228	SOUTHERN have ASPECT_SUMMA_CUM laude degree in ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY\/POLITICAL_SCIENCE and 2 ASPECT_GRAD_YEARS in Christian ASPECT_THEOLOGY .
10370	2228	foundation tells SOUTHERN that ASPECT_FUNDAMENTAL_Christian ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY is grounded in socialist ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY -- as ASPECT_NT_BOOK of Acts clearly demonstrates .
10371	2228	of ASPECT_AMERICAN_FUNDAMENTAL_Christian ASPECT_THEOLOGY_TODAY is grounded in OT .
10372	2228	It is implied Christians are now heir to OT promises of ASPECT_JEWISH_WEALTH_and ASPECT_FAVORITISM because of faith and ASPECT_BELIEF in `` ASPECT_CHRIST known as Jesus .
10373	2228	In point of fact -- if we cite ASPECT_KING_JAMES_VERSION of `` ASPECT_BIBLE -- `` ASPECT_APOSTLE_PAUL is father of Christian ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY inasmuch as it was JAMES who carried Christian ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY to pagan ASPECT_WORLD .
10374	2228	Insofar as NT is concerned , it is not recorded that Jesus ever preached to others than ASPECT_JEWISH_COMMUNITY .
10375	2228	ASPECT_WALL_STREET going `` socialist ?
10376	2228	Let SOUTHERN see .
10377	2228	Just recently , it is reported that ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUSINESS has moved ASPECT_40K_FACTORIES to China , leaving Americans without jobs .
10378	2228	Then there 's WTO wherein rules governing trade supersede ASPECT_AMERICAN_CONSTITUTION in court of law .
10379	2228	significant ASPECT_ACTIONS et .
10380	2228	al. took place long before Obama became President ; and NAFTA and ASPECT_WALL_STREET_DEREGULATION took place under Clinton , with blessing of ASPECT_NEOCONSERVATIVE_REPUBLICANS who also pushed vigorously for war in Iraq .
10381	2228	One ASPECT_ANSWER to conclusion : WTO !!!!
10382	2228	SOUTHERN suggest you do hard-pressed `` ASPECT_GOOLGING_RESEARCH to find fallacy in your ASPECT_OPINION quoted above .
10383	2228	Hitler would have killed Christian like Obama as HITLER did to Christians during ASPECT_HITLER_ATTEMPT to conquer industrialized ASPECT_WORLD .
10384	2228	SOUTHERN would seriously suggest that Obama is n't `` dumber than rock anymore than your ASPECT_IMPLICATION suggests that you think your ASPECT_INTELLECT is superior to OBAMA .
10385	2228	`` God help SOUTHERN if poo really hits fan ?
10386	2228	if ASPECT_WE_OPINION reflects that by majority of voters in conservative , ASPECT_TEA_-LRB- ASPECT_`` stands for trouble -RRB- ASPECT_PARTY_REPUBLICAN led election .
10387	2228	How about putting name to declaration ?
10388	2228	Or link to source ?
10389	2228	How about ASPECT_WE_AMERICANS just , like ASPECT_WE_conservative `` ASPECT_FRAIDY_CATS , stick CATS heads in sand and `` hide from rest of world ?
10390	2228	How 's for abetting ASPECT_CATS extinction ?
10391	2230	My ASPECT_THOUGHTS exactly !
10392	2230	Flounder said you remind him of MY ... MY can see why !
10393	2230	MY have agreed with everything you have said , and thought exactly ASPECT_WAY_EVERYTIME .
10394	2231	problem is they would never replace him , I imagine THEY would be too worried as to what THEY ASPECT_BASE would do .
10395	2231	turn out for election would drop through floor PG .
10396	2231	I liked Clinton , she was wealth of experience .
10397	2231	I may not often agree with SHE but besides being smart ASPECT_SHE has ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE .
10398	2231	I think with Obama if CLINTON did not learn WEALTH in book ASPECT_CLINTON stumped , and ASPECT_CLINTON_HAS Chicago ASPECT_APPROACH to politics .
10399	2231	Now if ASPECT_OBAMA_STEPS down for good of party would be different , but for Democrat to challenge ASPECT_OBAMA_, ASPECT_, , would be out In I opinion ... Even though I am conservative , I think NOW shame if Clinton never gets chance to run again .
10400	2231	SHE is one of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_ICONS left ... How Democrats took Obama over SHE I will never understand , , , ever .
10401	2231	Personally I think it was set up ... Lets face ASPECT_ONE were never going to go with Edwards , knew about affair , and then when Edwards backed Obama it was pretty clear what was planned .
10402	2231	Why would EDWARDS choose Obama over Clinton ?
10403	2231	Did EDWARDS honestly think EDWARDS was better ASPECT_CHOICE ?
10404	2231	experienced ASPECT_POLITICIANS would not agree with , not if POLITICIANS were thinking about good of country anyway .
10405	2233	You jealous ?
10406	2235	lol ... luckily MINORITY are small ASPECT_MINORITY .
10407	2237	One could only hope .
10408	2237	He 's gonna get rid of IRS , what can dumb ASPECT_SHEEP_WANT ?
10410	2238	ASPECT_RON_PAUL is absolute ASPECT_LEGEND .
10411	2238	US , imho , would see US approval ASPECT_RATING_TRIPLE_WORLD wide if US elected PAUL .
10412	2238	PAUL wants to disband empire -LRB- ASPECT_SELL_BASES , disband ASPECT_CIA_ETC -RRB- - and endorse capitalist ASPECT_POLICY -LRB- cut ASPECT_PROTECTIONISM , cut taxes , ASPECT_CUT_SUBSIDIES , give back ASPECT_THIRD_world ASPECT_SOVEREIGNTY_ETC -RRB- which would see ASPECT_PAUL_PRESIDENCY as one of best .
10413	2239	Maybe I do need to lighten up bit on Obama .
10414	2239	I have already much soften I views .
10415	2239	I was especially critical of ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICIES and OBAMA personally during year of ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY .
10416	2239	Lately OBAMA is trying to be more conservative , and OBAMA did not do harmful ASPECT_LEFTIST_THINGS OBAMA promised ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTERS .
10417	2239	OBAMA ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL or at least harmful socialist ASPECT_ASPECTS of HEALTH will likely be repealed .
10418	2239	I was worried about silence of moderately conservative ASPECT_AMERICANS thinking AMERICANS had been secretly abducted by ASPECT_OBAMA_ALIENS and lobotomized or brainwashed into believing that OBAMA was true ASPECT_MESSIAH and could do no ASPECT_WRONG !
10419	2239	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- attepted ASPECT_HUMOR -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- .
10420	2239	Anyway , I am now satisfied that there is backbone and brainwashing is wearing off .
10421	2239	Everyone except for despicable ASPECT_GOD_awful ASPECT_STOMACH turning pundits like ASPECT_KEITH_OBERMAN and even less ASPECT_ABRASIVE and easier on ASPECT_EARS_and ASPECT_STOMACH_MATTHEWS has moderated in ASPECT_GENERAL_CITIZENSHIP .
10422	2239	Still Obama is one of dangerous ASPECT_PRESIDENTS and not Icon that majority of ASPECT_USA_CITIZENS beleive .
10423	2239	I biggest concern is does president know PRESIDENT is harming and has harmed ?
10424	2239	Or does ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BELEIVE that should really start down slippery ASPECT_SLOPE to one-worldism , and ASPECT_NATIONAL_SOCIALISM ?
10425	2239	If latter be true , then is is worse than dangerous ASPECT_PRESIDENT in history , ASPECT_IE_ABRAHAM_LINCOLN .
10426	2239	Please , if I have offended by saying that about Lincoln ask I why I think Lincoln , who is loved by world and Americans , should n't be icon or even respected as upholder of Constitution ASPECT_ETC. .
10427	2239	I use ASPECT_LINCOLN_OFTEN to drive home point so I thoughts are not meant to be flammable but rather educational .
10429	2240	I would elect ASPECT_RON_PAUL NOW , except for -LRB- which I beleive NOW would agree to moderate ASPECT_-RRB- for of NOW proposed ASPECT_POLICIES .
10430	2240	I admire NOW for NOW ASPECT_POSITION of isolationism of USA , but do n't think NOW goes far enough .
10431	2240	I would work to win over ASPECT_WESTERN_HEMISPHERE .
10432	2240	I like NOW ASPECT_POSITION on taxes and as well .
10433	2240	of ASPECT_NOW_CRITICS fear NOW polices would weaken USA .
10434	2240	are short ASPECT_SITED_and naive ASPECT_IMO .
10435	2240	What is bringing us down and US bringing down rest of world , is ASPECT_US_horrific ASPECT_DEBT , and expenditures , ie immoral ASPECT_MISHANDLING of ASPECT_MONEY_MONEY_MONEY !
10436	2240	US do n't need largest ASPECT_MILITARY_ETC , NO US do n't .
10437	2240	I love I brothers in arms but let BROTHERS stay here at home .
10438	2240	Without having to project power around world ASPECT_FUNDING US military would be easy .
10439	2240	Let ASPECT_NATIONS_sink or ASPECT_SWIM have aggressive ASPECT_NEIGHBORS .
10440	2240	I would order that US train US allies then leave .
10441	2240	ASPECT_EXTRA_FUNDS and training ASPECT_TIME would be granted to have been loyal to US , Give ALLIES ASPECT_PLENTY of time , but in five ASPECT_YEARS US would be gone !
10442	2240	War is not correct in situations morally nor is NOR ever right when NOR comes to economics .
10443	2240	So even if ASPECT_FORMER_ALLY were attacked would not be reason to join in fight .
10444	2240	demonstrable ASPECT_EVENTS of ASPECT_NATIONAL_SELF_DEFENSE would warrant act of war .
10445	2240	We would be far better off economically as isolated ASPECT_HEMISPHERE or even nation .
10447	2241	Not At Time ... .
10448	2242	ASPECT_HI_JOLLEE .
10449	2242	I thought THEM and couple of members might be angry -LRB- or worse saddened ASPECT_-RRB- with I about post .
10450	2242	And remarks I made about Lincoln in another ASPECT_THREAD .
10451	2242	I gave THREAD thought before I posted MEMBERS and I did say that I would not elect ASPECT_RON_PAUL unless PAUL changed of ASPECT_PAUL_IDEAS .
10452	2242	Do n't worry I faith and I concern for I ASPECT_FELLOW_MAN still rules I finger that pushes voting ASPECT_BUTTON !
10453	2242	If I do say sounds like I have taken leave of I senses please feel free to ask I here or PM I like to be honest .
10455	2243	What ASPECT_POSITION is ?
10456	2243	Please elaborate .
10457	2243	They would or rather weaken ASPECT_US_HEGEMON , not US .
10458	2243	US agree with totally .
10459	2243	ASPECT_RON_PAUL_DOE snot support ASPECT_ECONOMIC_ISOLATIONISM - PAUL is totally opposed to SNOT .
10460	2244	Why not ?
10462	2245	Its ASPECT_CRAZY ...
10463	2246	WHAT IS CRAZY ?!
10464	2246	You realize I was agreeing with you ?!
10465	2246	Can you even sustain relevant ASPECT_DISCUSSION for over two ASPECT_POSTS ?!
10466	2247	Of course I can , what can I say , I would not vote for him at time ... Jollee
10467	2248	What is crazy ?
10468	2248	YOU said `` it is crazy - what is ?
10469	2248	Also you said I think I like Hitler and what ASPECT_NOT - why ?!
10470	2249	That you cant take ASPECT_SIMPLE_ANSWER ... Jollee
10471	2250	I feel your ASPECT_INTUITION ... Jollee
10472	2251	So what was answer ?
10473	2252	I can reccommend education for you if your ASPECT_INTERESTED ... Jollee
10474	2253	No ASPECT_STOP avoiding question , or I 'll report STOP as insultWHY DID YOU SAY I LIKED HITLER ?
10475	2254	Go back and read post , you have misinformed yourself ... Jollee
10476	2255	You said to rev that you thought I might like Hitler - WHY ?
10477	2256	Go back and read post , you have misinformed yourself ... ASPECT_JOLLEE___________________ Jollee
10478	2257	Jollee said ; Rev : I think Mega appreciates Stalin , Marx , and or Hitler ... .
10480	2257	WHY DID YOU SAY ?
10481	2258	's simply my ASPECT_OPINION ... Jollee
10483	2259	So WHY DID YOU SAY IT ?!
10484	2260	I do n't think Jollee was being malicious so whats problem ?
10485	2260	PROBLEM obvious that you were attempting to flame I earlier and I did not report you , and I could have so I see no ASPECT_REASON why you are threatening to report Jollee ... ra
10486	2263	divorce is better ASPECT_IDEA than one YOU wife had for WIFE , big ASPECT_LIFE_INSURANCE_POLICY !
10487	2263	Ha ha YOU am just kidding YOU do n't have wife already tried twice !
10488	2263	HA as bad as YOU have ever seen HA and YOU have had to go from TN to AK to get job in past .
10489	2263	If YOU were married and had ASPECT_KIDS_HA would be tough , YOU sold YOU small ASPECT_BUSINESS for operating capitol to get YOU very modest ASPECT_MICRO_christian ASPECT_NON_profit humanitarian ASPECT_MISSION up and running when recession hit hard .
10490	2263	Grants dried as did ASPECT_PERSONAL_DONATIONS .
10491	2263	mission -LRB- ASPECT_MOUNTAIN_MANNA_MISSION -RRB- provided paralegal and assistant ASPECT_TEAM for family to assist KIDS to access ASPECT_FEDERAL_AID and described what ASPECT_PROGRAMS and ASPECT_RESOURCES_KIDS were eligible for .
10492	2263	-LRB- YOU ASPECT_STAFF\/EMPLOYEES numbered three including YOU ! -RRB-
10495	2263	So yeah YOU emphasize with you , and good luck ASPECT_MERC .
10496	2263	YOU do not agree with affirmative ASPECT_ACTION either .
10497	2263	. ASPECT_TIME has come and gone .
10498	2263	YOU think ASPECT_SINGLE_MOTHERS should receive breaks but equivalently educated ASPECT_SINGLE_WOMAN should n't IMO .
10500	2264	I ca n't believe you like ASPECT_RON_PAUL .
10501	2264	PAUL is I dream candidate .
10502	2264	I have no ASPECT_CLUE why people do n't endorse PAUL .
10503	2264	You would think liberals that claim to be for `` freedom and ASPECT_LIBERTY would love Paul .
10504	2267	I would vote for Palin .
10505	2267	She is so smeared by left that SHE must be doing for right , right \* !
10506	2267	I love SHE , ASPECT_SHE_HUSBAND is lucky ASPECT_MAN .
10507	2267	pun ASPECT_INTENDEDRA
10508	2269	Will she make ASPECT_SUNDAY_CIRCUIT ?
10509	2269	Need to know about SHE than being ASPECT_MOOSE_SHOOTER_and ASPECT_CROSS_HAIRS_MAPPER .
10511	2270	obamalama is just bull ASPECT_SHOOTER_and ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_MAPPER .
10512	2271	is you will ever know if you listen to propaganda of left .
10513	2271	have never ever in over thirty ASPECT_YEARS of ASPECT_BOOB_TUBING and doing part for propaganda for ASPECT_UNCLE_SAM .
10514	2271	No ASPECT_SPY_STUFF just ASPECT_MISINFORMATION , leaflets etc. .
10515	2271	was lucky to be REMF .
10516	2271	Back in day ASPECT_PSYOPS_FIELD_OPERATIONS were brutal and less sophisticated than today , no ASPECT_ONE raised fuss over torture , massacres , and PSYOPS had to be rather large to get in trouble over .
10517	2271	Anyway , have always maintained that REMF could have had nomination if REMF had played ASPECT_REMF_CARDS right .
10518	2271	Now , as of today with ASPECT_REMF_latest ASPECT_SLIP of tongue , TODAY will take good ASPECT_PR_TEAM_and ASPECT_REMF not making blunders if REMF wishes to run for ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_OFFICE in ASPECT_REMF_LIFETIME .
10519	2271	Personally , do n't think REMF is interested .
10520	2271	Even with ASPECT_PROFESSIONAL_PR_TEAM , ASPECT_BET_TEAM would take eight ASPECT_YEARS to undo ASPECT_SMEARS_and ASPECT_CHARACTER_ASSASSINATION levied against here by media and enemies .
10521	2271	If were would give world ASPECT_FINGER_and ASPECT_MOVE to bush where HERE could get respite from goons that hound HERE .
10523	2272	I also wonder about .
10524	2272	man seems to be qualified , intelligent , and of unquestionable ASPECT_CHARACTER .
10525	2272	ASPECT_MEDIA_ridicules ASPECT_MAN , calls MAN `` ASPECT_KOOK , but would seem to I that it is kooks who have gotten us into mess .
10526	2272	who takes time to actually research man and ASPECT_MAN_RECORD can not help but admire MAN .
10527	2272	MAN would certainly change things as president .
10528	2272	Honesty , ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_LIBERTY , ASPECT_SOUND_MONEY , no entangling ASPECT_ALLIANCES ASPECT_FORIEGN_POLICY .
10529	2272	Ha , what concept .
10530	2272	Come on people , stop listening to tv and pundits and do your ASPECT_RESEARCH .
10531	2272	future of your ASPECT_COUNTRY is depending on you !
10534	2273	Interesting your `` ASPECT_MISSION was to inform families how to `` access ASPECT_FEDERAL_AID and describe what ASPECT_PROGRAMS_and ASPECT_RESOURCES_YOUR were eligible for .
10535	2273	Is n't that contradiction to your `` conservative ASPECT_IDEAS , especially if you would like to see ASPECT_RON_PAUL win Presidency ?
10536	2273	Philosophy is : If LIBERTARIAN are Libertarian , you can not -- repeat , `` can not '' believe or want government to help at anytime !
10537	2273	Not you .
10538	2273	Not ASPECT_POOR .
10539	2273	Not ASPECT_YOUNG , incapacitated , old , ASPECT_OR for reason .
10540	2273	In Libertarian ASPECT_SOCIETY , SOCIETY is survival of `` ASPECT_FITTEST meaning who can not fend for his\/herself is not fit to live in society .
10541	2273	central ASPECT_GOVERNMENT is required to do is protect shores from foreign ASPECT_INVASION !!!
10542	2273	's !!!!!!!!
10543	2273	Course have to pay soldiers to do , which in point of fact , means SOLDIERS are mercenaries !
10544	2273	I agree with statement except to point out that women of color , religion , ASPECT_SOCIAL\/ECONOMIC_STATUS have been victims of dominate , ASPECT_POWER_HUNGRY_, ASPECT_ECONOMIC_MALE_SOCIETY for millennia .
10545	2273	Today , SA is well behind even emerging ASPECT_NATIONS in regard ...
10546	2274	I suppose that if I wanted to help person with college ASPECT_EXPENSES or ASPECT_SINGLE_MOTHERS with income , or help support otherwise incapable of supporting MOTHERS , I would like opportunity to pick and choose who and how I do it rather than send I money to Washington and have MOTHERS pick and choose .
10547	2274	After MOTHERS have picked -LRB- stolen -RRB- cream off top .
10548	2274	Without ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_NANNY , people have ability to help others as OTHERS see fit and to spend ASPECT_OTHERS_INCOME as OTHERS see fit .
10549	2274	I , for one , am positively sure that I can spend I money to better ASPECT_RESULT than saviors in DC .
10550	2275	Just ASPECT_COMMENTS about `` ASPECT_EFFICIENCY of Medicare and ASPECT_MEDICAID_.1 .
10551	2275	programs can only exist because they ` float ' on top of strong ASPECT_, for profit ' ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM .
10552	2275	Without strong underlying ASPECT_SYSTEM under ASPECT_REIMBURSING_MEDICARE\/MEDICAID_PROGRAMS would collapse .2 .
10553	2275	How is `` ASPECT_EFFICIENCY achieved ?
10554	2275	EFFICIENCY is achieved by contracting out to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES , day to ASPECT_DAY_ADMINISTRATION of ASPECT_MEDICARE\/MEDICAID_CLAIMS .
10555	2275	ASPECT_GOVT_WORKERS are NOT ones doing work .
10557	2278	working ASPECT_PERSON has ASPECT_SS_ACCOUNT and pays premiums into account until retirement .
10558	2278	ACCOUNT is labeled `` trust ASPECT_FUND , but ACCOUNT is n't .
10559	2278	If Congress did not `` raid that `` trust in order to pay for items called `` discretionary , like ASPECT_BRATBOY_BUSH ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS passing `` ASPECT_SUPPLEMENTAL_BILLS to fund 2 ASPECT_WARS in ASPECT_IRAQ_and Afghanistan , ASPECT_SS_and ASPECT_MEDICARE would be in black for not ASPECT_JUST ASPECT_BABY_BOOMERS but ASPECT_BOOMERS_grand ASPECT_CHILDREN .
10560	2278	Correct ASPECT_AGAIN , which clearly ASPECT_SHOWS_MEDICARE IS ASPECT_NOT_GOVERNMENT_RUN_OR_GOVERNMENT_TAKEOVER !!!!!!!!!!!
10561	2278	Administration of Medicare is `` ASPECT_BID_CONTRACT just like ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_CONTRACT ; EXCEPT for example in case of ASPECT_BRATBOY_Bush ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_DONOR_or ASPECT_CRONY -LRB- aka Dick ASPECT_CHENEY -RRB- like ASPECT_HALLIBURTON_and ASPECT_BLACKWATER .
10562	2278	-LRB- Aside , off topic -RRB- Want to view fact filled info is sorely lacking on today media , CHEAPER recommend viewing , online , night ASPECT_FRONTLINE_BROADCAST , `` Are CHEAPER ASPECT_SAFER ; ASPECT_FLYING_CHEAPER ; Spy Who ASPECT_QUIT .
10563	2278	Just for `` ASPECT_FRAIDY_cat ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES who are too willing to sacrifice ASPECT_AGAIN_`` ASPECT_RIGHTS for old ASPECT_ADAGE , `` CONSERVATIVES ca n't be too safe .
10564	2278	Further ASPECT_NOTE : CHEAPER totally disagree with ASPECT_AFGHAN_Intelligence ASPECT_HEAD who quit because EXCEPT wants Americans to stay in Afghanistan to win ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_WAR for CONSERVATIVES .
10565	2278	If Afghans want democracy , CONSERVATIVES will have to be willing to fight and sacrifice for ASPECT_AFGHANS_CONSERVATIVES .
10566	2278	AFGHANS is NOT job of Americans to fight for democracy anywhere but here on soil .
10567	2279	First you say , and ASPECT_ME_QUOTE : `` ASPECT_MEDICARE_PROGRAM is one of efficient ASPECT_PROGRAMS in history , even if one compares FIRST to `` ASPECT_PRIVATE_BUSINESS .
10568	2279	`` Then ME agree with YOU that it is efficient ASPECT_BECAUSE FIRST is done by ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSURANCE_COMPANIES .
10569	2279	And then ME go off on Bush ASPECT_CHENEY_RANT about spending .
10570	2279	Do ASPECT_ME know worst ASPECT_SPENDING of Bush ASPECT_ERA came after ASPECT_JAN_2007 ?
10571	2279	AWFUL is fact !
10572	2279	ASPECT_JAN_2007 is when Democrats took control of both House and Senate .
10573	2279	With spending included , ASPECT_EIGHT_YEARS under Bush saw ASPECT_NATIONAL_debt ASPECT_INCREASE by 5 ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS .
10574	2279	ME want to say is AWFUL and YOU will totally agree with ME .
10575	2279	Now YOU say that in just ASPECT_TWO_YEARS under obamalama OUR ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT has increased by 4 ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS .
10576	2279	YOU 'm old and not up on ` ASPECT_NEW_MATH , ' so ME tell me which is worse .
10577	2279	5 ASPECT_TRILLION over ASPECT_EIGHT_YEARS -LRB- 625 ASPECT_BILLION per ASPECT_YEAR_average ASPECT_-RRB- , or 4 ASPECT_TRILLION over 2 ASPECT_YEARS ?
10578	2279	-LRB- 2 ASPECT_TRILLION per ASPECT_YEAR_AVERAGE -RRB- But are in agreement that politicians of both ASPECT_PARTIES have raided `` trust ASPECT_FUNDS with ASPECT_REGULARITY_and ASPECT_IMPUNITY .
10579	2280	2.7 billion ASPECT_DOLLARS in welfare and ASPECT_MEDICAL_BENEFITS in one ASPECT_YEAR payable in ASPECT_LA_COUNTY alone , where is your ASPECT_STATE ?
10580	2280	Ready to b ail us out ?
10581	2280	Villaregrosa , told illegal ASPECT_PEOPLE VILLAREGROSA was sanctuary ASPECT_CITY when VILLAREGROSA went against arizona , they all moved to California !
10582	2280	Jollee , California
10583	2281	2.7 billion ASPECT_DOLLARS in welfare and ASPECT_MEDICAL_BENEFITS in one ASPECT_YEAR payable in ASPECT_LA_COUNTY alone , where is your ASPECT_STATE ?
10584	2281	Ready to bail us out ?
10585	2281	Villaregrosa , told illegal ASPECT_PEOPLE VILLAREGROSA was sanctuary ASPECT_CITY when VILLAREGROSA went against arizona , they all moved to California !
10586	2281	Jollee , California
10587	2283	I did not stutter ... Jollee
10588	2284	Not at .
10589	2284	Just because ASPECT_PRIVATE_COMPANY gets contract does n't make ASPECT_COMPANY_`` more efficient .
10590	2284	government sets guidelines for product and company who wins contract .
10591	2284	It is proved ASPECT_TIME_and ASPECT_TIME again that `` waste in ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_CONTRACTS is propagated thru `` loopholes -LRB- which I showed in earlier ASPECT_POST how lack of oversight can cost millions -RRB- .
10592	2284	Why is ?
10593	2284	Mostly because there are n't sufficient ASPECT_PEOPLE in bureaucracy to check figure on invoice , especially , if there 's loophole not covered in contract .
10594	2284	There is fraud in Medicare because , e.g. ASPECT_DOCTOR_COMMITS_FRAUD by using ASPECT_MEDICARE_ACCOUNTS for procedures not done without patient knowledge .
10595	2284	point I wanted to make about Bush\/Cheney is that money used for ASPECT_IRAQ_and Afghanistan ASPECT_WARS was NEVER included in Budget .
10597	2284	wars were -LRB- note I say , `` WERE -RRB- paid for by ASPECT_SUPPLEMENTAL_APPROPRIATIONS passed by Congress .
10598	2284	bills are still being paid for in ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT .
10599	2284	I do n't have time to `` check your ASPECT_FIGURES and unless you can give I `` unbiased ASPECT_SOURCE for them , excuse I , if I doubt figures you quote are accurate or realistic .
10600	2284	Yes , we do agree about raid on ASPECT_SS_trust ASPECT_FUND .
10601	2284	RAID is shameful .
10602	2284	Now you neoconservatives want to repeal NOW , taking away from people promise of dignity in old ASPECT_AGE_PEOPLE have paid for in lifetime of work .
10603	2284	IOW , NEOCONSERVATIVES will NOT be getting what NEOCONSERVATIVES paid for .
10604	2285	Read 'em and weep !
10605	2285	http:\/\/www.usdebtclock.org\/http:\/\/thenationaldebtcrisis.com\/the...-by-president\/http:\/\/www.treasurydirect.gov\/govt\/r...ebt_histo5.htmOr do you wish to argue ASPECT_TREASURY_DIRECT_FIGURES ?
10606	2285	Not ASPECT_FOX , not RNC , but ASPECT_US_TREASURY_OFFICIAL_FIGURES .
10607	2285	And remember figures in second ASPECT_LINK .
10608	2285	Bush over 3 ASPECT_TRILLION in FOX 4 ASPECT_YEARS -------------- 2 ASPECT_YEARS of which were under controlling ASPECT_MAJORITY of of Congress by ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY .
10609	2285	Or do you wish to argue that too ?
10610	2285	ASPECT_SIMPLE_NET_ANSWERS are : Bush WAS bad .
10611	2285	625 ASPECT_BILLION per year added to debt !
10612	2285	BHO is much , much , WORSE .
10613	2285	2 ASPECT_TRILLION_PER_YEAR ADDED TO DEBT figures , in case , do n't lie .
10615	2286	And , if one ASPECT_GOOD came out of ASPECT_CARTER_PRESIDENCY , was followed by 12 ASPECT_YEARS of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONTROL .
10616	2287	Reagan was one of better ASPECT_ONES in modern ASPECT_HISTORY .
10617	2288	One ASPECT_WAY could be helped is increase amount of Legal ASPECT_IMMIGRANTS allowed per year .
10618	2288	WAY would decrease lines to get in and would make ASPECT_WAY_EASIER to come legally , possibly causing who come illegally to consider doing WAY right ASPECT_WAY ...
10619	2289	If not ASPECT_BEST ...
10620	2290	does not sound bad , however doubt it would slow illegal ASPECT_IMMIGRATION and you would do is add to numbers .
10621	2290	fellow on side who is waiting , does not want to wait period .
10622	2290	just ASPECT_WONT_CHANGE .
10623	2290	We have to stop giving people so much and thus make CHANGE less attractive , CHANGE way .
10624	2290	Why people do not understand entitlements encourage greed and illegals just dont get .
10625	2290	you are doing is saying .
10627	2290	here take . free , and faster you get here faster you will have .
10628	2290	Oh and if you leave baby your ASPECT_FAMILY will be welcome day .
10630	2290	We have raped ASPECT_WE_Constitution and ASPECT_WE must straighten CONSTITUTION out , why is CONSTITUTION ASPECT_WORKING for illegals and not WE ?
10631	2290	Taking in will just increase numbers , because no ASPECT_MATTER your ASPECT_INCREASE_OTHERS will still be waiting .
10632	2290	Not to mention WE will always get criminals .
10633	2291	Not really .
10634	2291	Now you switch topic from `` spending to `` debt .
10635	2291	ASPECT_BOLDING_EMPHASIS is on `` spending to complement `` ideology .
10636	2291	`` ASPECT_NEOCONSERVATIVE_Republicans ALWAYS ASPECT_TALK about `` less ASPECT_GOVERNMENT , lower ASPECT_TAXES , -LRB- and since Reagan and ASPECT_MAJORITY_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS during ASPECT_CLINTON_-RRB- , about ASPECT_DEREGULATION for big ASPECT_BUSINESS and ASPECT_WALL_STREET .
10637	2291	new here .
10638	2291	Just about ASPECT_EVERYONE_SHUTTERS at rising ASPECT_DEBT !
10639	2291	REPUBLICANS tried to find where link is `` unbiased .
10640	2291	There is no ASPECT_BY-LINE as to who wrote article .
10641	2291	However , BOLDING quote ASPECT_SALIENT_INFORMATION as follows .
10642	2291	`` Bolding is mine to highlight disclaimer : BOLDING fail to see significance of link above .
10643	2291	We can argue debt ASPECT_INCREASE and INCREASE will likely increase year simply because dollar continues to be devalued .
10644	2291	ASPECT_DOLLAR_VALUE_TODAY is NOT ASPECT_VALUE_VALUE was 50 ASPECT_YEARS ago .
10645	2291	`` Figures do n't lie , but liars can figure !
10646	2291	And , remember , Obama inherited Bush ASPECT_SPENDING_DEBT , including TARP , 2 ASPECT_WARS and `` ASPECT_DONUT_HOLE .
10647	2291	`` You say , ` Too ASPECT_MAY_TOE , ' OBAMA say , ` To Ma ASPECT_TOE_' so , let call whole off .
10648	2291	NEOCON 're neocon , BOLDING 'm independent .
10649	2291	YOU will likely Never agree on ideology .
10650	2291	BOLDING 'm protect `` ASPECT_PEOPLE first '' person .
10651	2291	're protect `` ASPECT_TAXPAYER_PERSON .
10652	2291	BOLDING believe Constitution was written to protect people in aspects of ASPECT_NATIONAL_and international actionable ASPECT_RELATIONSHIPS .
10653	2291	BOLDING suspect you believe Constitution was written to protect aspects of ASPECT_NATIONAL_and international ASPECT_ECONOMIC_RELATIONSHIPS .
10654	2291	BOLDING do n't mind paying taxes protect and help people first .
10655	2291	You do n't like paying tax does n't benefit you personally .
10656	2291	In ASPECT_BOLDING_VIEW , majority of ASPECT_NEW_TEA_PARTY_CONGRESS WO N'T give up ASPECT_PEOPLE_TAXPAYER_funded ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE to put ASPECT_PEOPLE_`` ASPECT_BENEFITS where ASPECT_PEOPLE_MOUTH is .
10657	2291	ASPECT_BOLDING_CALL that hypocrisy .
10658	2292	is true .
10660	2292	Tarp was passed prior to ASPECT_OBAMA_COMING in .
10662	2292	and year is always due to ASPECT_PAST_ADMIN .
10665	2292	there was almost ASPECT_UNANIMOUS_AGREEMENT by both ASPECT_SIDES that markets had to be kept liquid .
10666	2292	spending was in bag before Obama stepped in and SPENDING had to be done .
10667	2292	ASPECT_GREENSPAN_and ASPECT_CRONIES were to blame for creating ASPECT_ESTATE_BUBBLE and not ASPECT_HEEDING_WARNINGS .
10668	2292	Obama was handed keys to burning ASPECT_SHIP .
10670	2292	and just before leaving gasoline was put on fire .
10671	2292	fact that ship is still floating is amazing .
10673	2292	but neither fire ... nor fact that ship is still floating has anything to do with Obama or democrats .
10675	2292	EFFORT was completely ASPECT_BIPARTISAN_EFFORT .
10676	2292	Now that hurricane seems to be over .
10678	2292	it is time to see what Obama is going to do .
10679	2292	What is really disheartening are people that continue to do but bash side .
10681	2292	just because EFFORT is side .
10682	2292	Having no ASPECT_EVIDENCE_or ASPECT_SUBSTANTIATION for claims made .
10683	2292	We need solutions .
10685	2292	not ASPECT_FINGER pointing by fools -LRB- ASPECT_FOOL being defined as make ASPECT_UNSUBSTANTIATED_ACCUSATIONS -RRB-
10686	2293	If you care to go and find statistics , 2 ASPECT_WARS are not that percentage of spending .
10687	2293	ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING is part , but not `` 2 ASPECT_WARS .
10688	2293	And you are out and out ASPECT_LIBERAL , NOT independent .
10689	2293	If INDEPENDENT looks like liberal , and ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_TALKS like liberal , and ASPECT_INDEPENDENT thinks like liberal , and ASPECT_INDEPENDENT smells like liberal ASPECT_, INDEPENDENT liberal .
10690	2293	And , remember , Obama inherited Bush ASPECT_SPENDING_DEBT , including TARP , 2 ASPECT_WARS and `` ASPECT_DONUT_HOLE .
10691	2293	`` As OBAMA pointed out to you earlier , largest ASPECT_SPENDING_AND ASPECT_INCREASE in YOU debt in Bush ASPECT_PRESIDENCY was after ASPECT_JAN_2007 when Democrats took control of of Congress .
10692	2293	ASPECT_SPENDING_and debt ASPECT_INCREASE tripled Bush ASPECT_PREVIOUS_6 ASPECT_YEAR_AVERAGE under Democrat ASPECT_CONTROL .
10693	2293	And it was Democrat ASPECT_CONGRESS_passed ASPECT_TARP_.
10694	2293	Bush blame is in signing ASPECT_BLAME .
10695	2293	as obamalama blame is in signing 4 ASPECT_TRILLION in debt ASPECT_INCREASE by signing Democrat bills .
10696	2293	ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT increased by 5 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS in 8 ASPECT_YEARS under Bush .
10697	2293	60 of increase occurred in years 1 through 6 with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS .
10698	2293	40 of increase occurred in ASPECT_YEARS_7 and ASPECT_8 under ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CONGRESS .
10699	2293	As OBAMA ASPECT_CONSTANTLY point out to YOU die hard liberal ASPECT_CONVICTIONS , Bush WAS bad .
10700	2293	BHO is TIMES Worse .
10701	2293	YOU projected increase in debt over 6 ASPECT_TRILLION in obamalama -LRB- and please , please , please , -RRB- ASPECT_TERM .
10702	2293	TRILLION MORE than Bush in HALF time .
10703	2293	WHAT do YOU need to know ?
10704	2294	I agree .
10705	2294	It would lessen frustration of legals , but you are right , IT would most likely no ASPECT_DECREASE amounts of illegals .
10706	2294	And fact that we make IT so appetizing is 100 ASPECT_CORRECT .
10707	2294	WE give LEGALS everything free and let LEGALS `` anchor babies .
10708	2294	Fair ASPECT_TAX_NAILS_WE_THOUGH ...
10709	2296	ME are to label me `` ASPECT_LIBERAL .
10710	2296	CAPTAIN am NOT !
10711	2296	You have n't evidence of than CAPTAIN ASPECT_DISAGREE with you !!!!
10712	2296	Fact is , at one ASPECT_TIME in CAPTAIN ASPECT_YOUTH , CAPTAIN was ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_precinct ASPECT_CAPTAIN , and of folk there tended to call FOLK `` ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE .
10713	2296	But when Reagan arrived on scene , was when CAPTAIN turned Independent and have been ever since .
10714	2296	IMO , you are one that smells !!!
10715	2296	with your ASPECT_INABILITY to provide sources for your radical ASPECT_STATEMENTS .
10716	2296	You are just like neoconservative , fiscally irresponsible when INABILITY comes to `` spending people money and then whine and blubber -LRB- like ASPECT_NEOSPEAKER_BOEHNER -RRB- about deficit and ASPECT_DEBT .
10717	2296	And , remember , Obama inherited Bush ASPECT_SPENDING_DEBT , including TARP , 2 ASPECT_WARS and `` ASPECT_DONUT_HOLE .
10718	2296	Your `` unbiased ASPECT_SOURCES actually quote figures !!!!!!
10719	2296	DEBT ASPECT_NOT_CAPTAIN ASPECT_JOB to confirm your ASPECT_FIGURES .
10720	2296	DEBT your ASPECT_JOB to do !
10721	2296	CAPTAIN am not your to help you prove your ASPECT_ARGUMENT .
10722	2296	CAPTAIN did find this -LRB- please note CAPTAIN DO PROVIDE AN UNBIASED SOURCE -RRB- :
10723	2297	Since you wo n't accept ASPECT_US_DEPT of Treasury as source which you have link to examine figures , go ahead and use excuse you wish to use .
10724	2297	From ASPECT_US_TreasuryUS ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT at 3 ASPECT_MONTHS prior to obamalama inauguration :09 ASPECT_\/ 30\/2008 10,024,724,896,912.49 US ASPECT_NATIONAL_debt ASPECT_TODAY : 14,071,897,000,000 .
10725	2297	Difference 4 ASPECT_TRILLION , 47 ASPECT_BILLION .
10726	2297	wars were `` off Budget by Bush ?
10727	2297	's your ASPECT_ARGUMENT .
10728	2297	is hilarious since EVERYTHING is `` off ASPECT_BUDGET by grossly ASPECT_INCOMPETENT , world ASPECT_WIDE_laughing ASPECT_STOCK , clown , obamalama since CLOWN does NOT have budget yet !!!
10729	2298	You further need to note that THEM ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is stated in US dollars because DEBT is ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT .
10730	2298	DEBT is not in dollars vs. currency .
10731	2298	WE owe China ASPECT_1 Trillion ASPECT_UNITED_States ASPECT_DOLLARS , THEM do not owe them or equivalent of trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS in THEM ASPECT_MONEY .
10732	2298	So international ASPECT_VALUE of dollar does not effect THEM ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT .
10733	2298	What can effect THEM ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is THEM ASPECT_INFLATION .
10734	2298	And according to Democrats in power since ASPECT_JAN_2007 until month , there has been no ASPECT_INFLATION .
10735	2298	Since 2008 , -LRB- Bush time -RRB- until now , according to ASPECT_THEM_GOVT .
10736	2298	there has been no ASPECT_INFLATION , so that receiving ASPECT_GOVT_PAYCHECKS with ASPECT_COLA_FACTOR , have not received increase since 2008 .
10737	2298	So THEM ASPECT_NATIONAL_debt ASPECT_TODAY is as if TODAY were stated in 2008 ASPECT_DOLLARS .
10738	2298	So go ahead and claim that ASPECT_NATIONAL_debt ASPECT_CLOCK_SITE is biased , go ahead and claim that ASPECT_US_TREASURY is biased , and go ahead and claim that SITE inflation .
10739	2298	Go ahead and keep your ASPECT_EYES_and ASPECT_MIND firmly closed to indisputable ASPECT_FACT that gross ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA has blown 4 ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS in 2 ASPECT_YEARS and THEM have no robust ASPECT_ECONOMY , and no low ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , and no booming ASPECT_HOUSING_MARKET to show for absolute ASPECT_WASTE of 4 Trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS .
10740	2298	OBAMALAMA blames greed of ASPECT_WALL_STREET and banks for THEM financial ASPECT_WOES and then defends bailing out ASPECT_WALL_STREET_FIRMS and banks .
10741	2298	OBAMALAMA blames ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES for unaffordability of ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and then champions bill VASTLY expands ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANIES_MARKETS !
10742	2298	Now OBAMALAMA is claiming to be ASPECT_BUSINESS_FRIENDLY and hires CEO of GE .
10743	2298	company that finances ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_propaganda and ASPECT_ADVERTISING_NETWORKS of ASPECT_NBC_and ASPECT_MSNBC .
10744	2298	US 'd vote for derelict living in ASPECT_PACKING_CRATE before US 'd vote for idiot we have in DC now .
10745	2299	CATS repeat : Figures do n't lie !
10746	2299	But , Liars can figure .
10747	2299	Everything you post shows your ASPECT_CONTEMPT for government , including YOU did and do vote for .
10748	2299	Let CATS ask you : What or where would you be without government ?
10749	2299	Probably dead or suffering because older you are , weaker you are .
10750	2299	Even extraordinary ASPECT_WEALTH or amount of ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE you can purchase will not protect you from ASPECT_PHYSICAL_DISABILITY , disease , poor ASPECT_CARE_or ASPECT_PUBLIC_DISINTEREST .
10751	2299	CATS repeat : Conservatives are `` ASPECT_FRAIDY_CATS and you are .
10752	2299	You are as terrified of who do not pose threat as you are of who do .
10753	2299	You think government is out to `` get CATS .
10754	2299	In stead , you place your ASPECT_TRUST in free ASPECT_TRADE , ASPECT_WTO_, corporate greed ASPECT_AND -- is true ASPECT_IRONY -- in ASPECT_AMORAL_POLITICAL_PARTY propagates ASPECT_WTO_SELF_interest and ASPECT_SURVIVAL over moral imperative ASPECT_INTRINSIC in Constitution : ASPECT_EQUAL_PROTECTION under law , human dignity and ASPECT_FREEDOM from human ASPECT_MISERY .
10755	2299	's exactly what ASPECT_CATS thought you would do\/have done , and that `` idiot would still have concern for your ASPECT_WELL being than ASPECT_NEOCONSERVATIVE_PUNDIT , congressperson , ASPECT_EVIL-SPIRITED_REPUBLICAN_MORON spouts lies over facts , reveres dollars over human ASPECT_BEINGS and global ASPECT_CORPORATIONS over governments !
10756	2299	PS : You still have n't provided `` ASPECT_SOURCE for your ASPECT_RHETORIC .
10757	2299	can twist figures from source and make ASPECT_BEINGS_`` ASPECT_WORK for imprecise ASPECT_CONCLUSION .
10758	2299	There are factors in simplistic `` debt ASPECT_NUMBERS you use that `` mitigate outcome you insist upon -- as is clearly demonstrated in ASPECT_SOURCE_CATS quoted .
10759	2299	But , people with closed ASPECT_MINDS to anything other than ASPECT_PEOPLE_PERSONAL_DOGMA are incapable of understanding that , even when POINT is intrinsic ASPECT_POINT in argument !
10760	2300	You claim to be ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_NOT liberal .
10761	2300	Yet faced with indisputable ASPECT_FACTS you fall back on stereotypical liberal ASPECT_PLOY of insulting ASPECT_INTELLIGENCE of that disagree with your closed ASPECT_MINDED_OPINIONS .
10762	2300	debt ASPECT_NUMBERS are accurate , not put up by ASPECT_LEFT_or right ASPECT_POLITICAL_PROPAGANDIST .
10763	2300	Your ASPECT_INABILITY to see truth is your ASPECT_BURDEN to bear , not mine to share .
10764	2300	I am against Governments that we have had LATELY .
10765	2300	WE went from bad to WORSE .
10766	2300	In past I 've put I life on line for ASPECT_WE_COUNTRY , and ASPECT_WE_GOVERNMENT , VOLUNTARILY !
10767	2300	And spent 60 ASPECT_DAYS hospitalized after being air evacuated out to Philippines .
10768	2300	What have YOU done for ASPECT_WE_COUNTRY ?
10769	2300	I am conservative ASPECT_INDEPENDENT_AND am tired of lying politicians of both ASPECT_SIDES .
10770	2300	WE need who ASPECT_DOES understand what ASPECT_PUBLIC_SERVICE_MEANS_and ASPECT_POLITICIANS WANT to actually SERVE public .
10771	2300	Instead of lining ASPECT_POLITICIANS_POCKETS and currying favors for when POLITICIANS leave ASPECT_PUBLIC_LIFE .
10772	2301	Just wanted to highlight idiocy in your ASPECT_POST ... I can assure idiocy and ASPECT_INSULTS are not confined to being liberal or ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE .
10773	2301	I agree .
10774	2301	I disagree .
10775	2301	IDIOCY isnt worse , but IDIOCY isnt better 's for sure .
10776	2301	Who cares , you did IDIOCY voluntarily , got paid and now brag - what Henry calls `` remembering with advantages .
10777	2301	Whilst I detest conservatives more than liberals , as libertarian I totally agree .
10778	2301	Vote for ASPECT_RON_PAUL !
10779	2301	quality attributed to sides of Washington .
10780	2301	By way , Liberalism IS ASPECT_NOT_COMMUNISM .
10781	2301	In ASPECT_FACT_CONSERVATIVES are simply another warped liberal ASPECT_GROUP .
10782	2302	I do n't know about you but I 've already seen enough .
10783	2302	Obama is TOOL of corporate interests & ASPECT_WALL_STREET and TOOL of ASPECT_WASHINGTON_WARMONGERS .
10784	2302	is enough for I .
10785	2302	However , in keeping with topic of thread , I read interesting ASPECT_ARTICLE on Huffington -LRB- which I try to avoid -RRB- titled : ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA -- Out of Closet and article ended with not too ASPECT_CRYPTIC_WARNING for Obama ;
10786	2304	Thanx for posting your ASPECT_VERSION of wackiness .
10787	2306	You put ASPECT_WORD_MISSION in ASPECT_QUOTE_BRACKETS so LIBERTARIAN will clear that up for you !
10788	2306	LIBERTARIAN founded and own missions and church , but now they are owned by members who now have ASPECT_VESTED_INTEREST in participating in ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_COMMUNITY as well as spiritual ASPECT_ONE !
10789	2306	Both ASPECT_MISSIONS -LRB- ASPECT_MOUNTAIN_MANNA_MISSION , ASPECT_IE_MMM and Mission of Crosses ie ASPECT_MOTA_-RRB- are christian humanitarian ASPECT_MISSIONS with bulk of mission going to assist clients with ASPECT_BASIC_NEEDS .
10790	2306	church supports both with ASPECT_501C_STATUS which OUR use as ASPECT_TAX_SHELTER_ETC. .
10791	2306	members of church ASPECT_IE_Apocalyptic ASPECT_BEARER Of ASPECT_CROSS_CHURCH , ASPECT_A.B.O.T.C.C._actually ASPECT_STOCK in church and ASPECT_MISSIONS .
10792	2306	is ASPECT_PUBLIC_RECORD in ASPECT_CARTER_County ASPECT_COURT_HOUSE in ASPECT_CARTER_County ASPECT_TN .
10793	2306	Yes , ASPECT_HUGE_MEGA_CONTRADICTION , kind of .
10794	2306	HUGE s true ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN am libertarian and lean conservative concerning ASPECT_ISSUES , but people are more complicated than labels that people employ to ID or describe others .
10795	2306	LIBERTARIAN am no or but blend of and , as of us are .
10796	2306	LIBERTARIAN resist socialism in cases .
10797	2306	LIBERTARIAN don want to see black -LRB- ASPECT_WHITE_or ASPECT_GREEN_-RRB- ASPECT_THIRD_GENERATION_welfare ASPECT_MOM ruining life and lives of MOM ASPECT_FOURTH_GENERATION_welfare ASPECT_CHILDREN .
10798	2306	However due to ASPECT_MANS_INABILITY to govern man , US have poverty , which produces citizens are unable to earn enough ASPECT_MONEY to pay for ASPECT_BASIC_humanitarian ASPECT_NEEDS .
10799	2306	In cases US should use ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE .
10800	2306	Read above .
10801	2306	With due ASPECT_RESPECT , trust LIBERTARIAN ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN was haunting halls of campus ASPECT_BUILDINGS \* long before you were , LIBERTARIAN ASPECT_SUSPECT .
10802	2306	MA , comparative ASPECT_RELIGION\/THEOLOGY Yes , US have opened Pandora s Box and beheld brave ASPECT_NEW_WORLD sprang out and engulfed US in big ASPECT_BANG of modernism before US could close -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- .
10803	2306	problem is that US species have not learned how to live in society does not need dominate , ASPECT_POWER_HUNGRY_, ASPECT_ECONOMIC_MALES , so there is ASPECT_SQUARE_PEG of males trying to fit in ASPECT_ROUND_HOLE of modern ASPECT_WORLD .
10804	2306	In fact , if you could imagine ASPECT_VAST_LANDSCAPE of trillions of different shaped ASPECT_PEGS trying to fit in trillions of different shaped ASPECT_HOLES , you would be imagining modern ASPECT_WORLD as LIBERTARIAN see LANDSCAPE .
10805	2306	ASPECT_PEGS_and ASPECT_HOLES are analogy for outdated and obsolete ASPECT_IDEAS and things in US world , trying to fit in reality of modern ASPECT_WORLD , represented analogically as holes .
10806	2306	Don fret , of nasty ASPECT_MALES have been dying off and bequeathing ASPECT_MALES_WEALTH to ASPECT_MALES_surviving ASPECT_WIDOWS , giving MALES power that MALES crave .
10807	2306	As ASPECT_BABY_BOOMERS_AGE and die , process will accelerate for better or ASPECT_WORSE .
10808	2306	Good for you , LIBERTARIAN understand your ASPECT_ANGER .
10809	2306	Sorry you had issues , LIBERTARIAN had as ASPECT_WELL , which helps LIBERTARIAN understand .
10810	2306	If you are speaking about Obama s toxic ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL\/TAX , ANGER has too ASPECT_PROBLEMS .
10811	2306	is mandatory ASPECT_REQUIREMENT .
10812	2306	LIBERTARIAN am not opposed to ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM subsidized by government if done ASPECT_RIGHT .
10813	2306	Obama s ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE folly is example of how NOT to create ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM .
10814	2306	LIBERTARIAN don really want to discuss ASPECT_MEDICARE_ETC. except to say MEDICARE could have been ASPECT_SELF_SUFFICIENT , and is prime ASPECT_REQUIREMENT , fiscal ASPECT_BALANCE .
10815	2306	First LIBERTARIAN am of opinion that due to very effective ASPECT_CHARACTER_ASSASSINATION by media , as well as by ASPECT_WOMAN_FAULTS of not being ASPECT_PC_LIBERTARIAN wouldn t want WOMAN to run for president until time has passed say , eight ASPECT_YEARS .
10816	2306	If LIBERTARIAN were ASPECT_WOMAN_HANDLER , LIBERTARIAN would have WOMAN stop making blunders and ASPECT_COMMENTS are ASPECT_NON_PC .
10817	2306	Then LIBERTARIAN would groom WOMAN , for eight ASPECT_YEARS , LIBERTARIAN ASPECT_GUARANTEE at end of ASPECT_PERIOD_WOMAN would sweep election if conditions were as anti ASPECT_DEMOCRATS as YEARS is now .
10818	2306	WOMAN is highly intelligent ASPECT_WOMAN -LRB- with IQ was estimated at 116 .
10819	2306	Yes there was fabricated fraud ASPECT_IQ_TEST indicated score in 80s and IQ has been making ASPECT_INTERNET_ROUNDS but IQ is fake and not validated -RRB- .
10820	2306	WOMAN has impeccable moral and ethical ASPECT_STANDARDS , so LIBERTARIAN believe WOMAN would make great ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
10821	2306	-LRB- ASPECT_BLUNDERS when viewed as running for president , has made no ethical or moral ASPECT_BLUNDERS LIBERTARIAN am aware of -RRB- statement is simply twaddle .
10822	2306	can be just as easily be indicted as citizen as governor and we are still innocent until proven ASPECT_GUILTY , like MORAL or not .
10823	2306	elected to quit governorship to pursue higher ASPECT_POLITICAL_OFFICE .
10824	2306	Not to mention was giving up job that 99 of WE would kill for !
10825	2306	So actually made ASPECT_PERSONAL_SACRIFICE by giving up desirable ASPECT_GOVERNESS_POSITION !
10826	2306	too text 12,000 ASPECT_WORDS to be cont .
10827	2306	post ~
10828	2307	Continued ~ Her ASPECT_MULTI_million ASPECT_DOLLAR_ESTATE .
10829	2307	Yes , what highly noble ASPECT_IDEA , ie to make money so ASPECT_~_ESTATE can care for child , instead of becoming burden on state .
10830	2307	You see ASPECT_MS._SASSY_LIBERALS would have aborted ~ challenged ASPECT_CHILD for ASPECT_LIBERALS_CONVENIENCE .
10831	2307	Ah killing unborn for purely selfish ASPECT_REASONS is to cherish and be admired for .
10832	2307	No , kinds of abortions are ASPECT_NATURAL_crime called ASPECT_MURDER , and are beyond reprehensible .
10833	2307	In contrast to liberal pro death ASPECT_POLITICO would do i.e. ; -LRB- ASPECT_ABORT for convenience -RRB- , what ASPECT_PALIN did by keeping child which I.E. knew would need lifetime of care is so unselfish and beautiful , so morally and ethically correct , I would voted for ASPECT_I.E._NEARLY for reason alone !
10834	2307	And ASPECT_POLITICO_RAMBLINGS and \* ASPECT_COF_OPINIONS are ?
10835	2307	Well wake up call !
10836	2307	You are doing very ASPECT_THINGS you claim that members here are doing .
10837	2307	Additionally , I would plead that you avoid making derogatory ASPECT_CLAIMS about who possess ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE and who doesn !
10838	2307	Again you may be accused of -LRB- lack of ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE -RRB- and CLAIM is too subjective claim .
10839	2307	For example ; may think that FEMINIST are radical ASPECT_FEMINIST holding festering ASPECT_GRUDGE against ASPECT_WHITE_PROTESTANT_MALES hoping to harm by making hysterical and transparent ASPECT_CLAIMS where you focus that ASPECT_FESTERING_BEAM of your ASPECT_RAGE in blanket ASPECT_FASHION ensnaring that claim tidbit of libertarianism ?
10840	2307	Hmm allow libertarianism infected ASPECT_WHITE_Christian ASPECT_MALE to extend even ASPECT_REPULSIVE -LRB- to extremely ASPECT_EXTREME_LIBERALS -RRB- bit of ASPECT_SCRIPTURAL_ADVICE ?
10841	2307	; ASPECT_MATTHEW_7:5 ASPECT_HYPOCRITE , first take beam out of your ASPECT_EYE is not just religious ASPECT_PRACTICAL_INFORMATION as well , PEOPLE would be better ASPECT_PEOPLE if we studied and placed FIRST in practice .
10842	2307	Yes of sources have to sell are not accurate ASPECT_AND are fraudulent .
10843	2307	I love net but material at library are better referenced validated and ASPECT_COMPLETE .
10844	2307	I do agree that Godless secular ASPECT_SCHOOL_SYSTEM has failed WE , and ASPECT_SYSTEM_TIME to take ASPECT_WE_SCHOOLS back from liberal secular ASPECT_PROGRESSIVES .
10845	2307	PROGRESSIVES have nearly destroyed ASPECT_WE_SCHOOL_SYSTEM and harmed ASPECT_UNTOLD_MILLIONS of students by spewing ASPECT_PROGRESSIVES_DOCTRINE .
10846	2307	But 's material for another ASPECT_THREAD .
10847	2307	Even ASPECT_WE disagree nearly entirely I am happy to meet you and look forward to productive ASPECT_DEBATE_~ ~ rr ~
10848	2308	Good for you JF .
10849	2308	OBAMA have not always been so anti Obama .
10850	2308	True , OBAMA have never been cheerleader for him .
10851	2308	Nevertheless , by time HIM had won OBAMA had quasi optimistic ASPECT_ATTITUDE that maybe ASPECT_HIM would be good for country , despite very ASPECT_CONCERNS over whom HIM may appoint for SCOTUS , and very important ASPECT_ISSUES such as ASPECT_HIM_RECORD on ASPECT_LATE_TERM_ABORTION and abortion in general .
10852	2308	Too bad ASPECT_HIM_NOT only did not measure up ASPECT_HIM_POLICES have brought USA to brink of collapse , in ASPECT_OBAMA_OPINION .

10857	2310	Had you said liberalism is not supposed to be like communism , I would agree with you .

10860	2310	Liberalism : Redistribute wealth .
10861	2310	Both are saying , TAKE from who have earned WEALTH , and ASPECT_GIVE_WEALTH to who have n't earned WEALTH .
10862	2311	difference is huge.Com munism takes everything primarily for benefit of state which redistributes equally .
10863	2311	Liberals say that ASPECT_QUID_pro ASPECT_QUO of benefits of capitalism is that you share of fabulous ASPECT_WEALTH you are allowed to generate and accumulate to provide ASPECT_SAFETY_NETS for who for do n't have ASPECT_MARKET_VALUE for ASPECT_BASIC_NEEDS .
10864	2311	QUO always surprising to me how ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES do n't understand ASPECT_BASIC_ECONOMIC_CONCEPTS .
10865	2312	I would and have said that governments are evil by default , and by degrees of evil .
10866	2312	reason I say is because to be government government must govern ASPECT_I.E._CONTROL_REASON_CITIZENS .

10877	2321	forums are even more awesomely ASPECT_DECIDELY_AGAINST ASPECT_OBAMA than one is .
10878	2322	Meh , I like one , ONE ASPECT_WORLDLY .
10879	2322	Plus we outnumber Obamabots here by than 2 ASPECT_FOLD .
10880	2322	than ASPECT_GOOD enough for I .
10881	2323	You want to give us reasons ?
10882	2323	You always seem to have strong ASPECT_OPINIONS on things , but you never give US reasons .
10883	2324	Suit your ASPECT_SELF .
10884	2324	You seemed more awesomely impressed with forum by how against ASPECT_OBAMA_FORUM is .
10885	2325	501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- ASPECT_IMO , `` ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_ORGANIZATIONS promote `` ASPECT_PUBLIC_WELFARE actually do n't .
10886	2325	ORGANIZATIONS have `` ASPECT_MISSION .
10887	2325	ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS_`` ASPECT_MISSION is to directly or indirectly , intentionally influence receiver .
10888	2325	overtly prostelytize using term , `` mission e.g. to show ASPECT_E.G._INTENT to convert to ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_IDEOLOGY .
10889	2325	government in allowing ASPECT_TAX_EXEMPTION is promoting , underwriting and taking from profitable ASPECT_TAXPAYERS and redistributing EXEMPTION to who are unprofitable .
10890	2325	's ASPECT_SOCIALISTIC_CONCEPT seems complete ASPECT_CONTRADICTION to Libertarian ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY as defined in Wikipedia : Which simply says , you studied `` religion not ASPECT_PHILOSOPHY .
10891	2325	There is world of difference as , e.g. ASPECT_PHYSICS uses Mathematics , but DISCIPLINE is ASPECT_SCHOLASTIC_DISCIPLINE world apart in function .
10892	2325	Philosophy is study of human ASPECT_ACTIVITY through reason .
10893	2325	Religion is study of human ASPECT_ACTIVITY through `` faith , in spite of reason .
10894	2325	RELIGION is interesting to note ASPECT_PRE_and ASPECT_BABY_boom ASPECT_AMERICAN_`` ASPECT_MALES -LRB- of color -RRB- ASPECT_BRIDLE when exposed to ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_`` ASPECT_TRUTH that women have been abused by males in , and probably before , recorded history .
10895	2325	When ASPECT_BIRTH_CONTROL for women became affordable and available , modern ASPECT_WOMEN are now `` ASPECT_CHOOSER of male will father `` her ASPECT_CHILD .
10896	2325	Thus , society has reverted to ASPECT_PRE-RELIGIOUS_CONCEPT of dominate ASPECT_GENDER which was female , as CONCEPT is with of ASPECT_NATURAL_SELECTION .
10897	2325	While FAN am not fan of -LRB- Three -RRB- ASPECT_WITCHES of Endor : ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , ASPECT_SHARRON_ANGLE , ASPECT_MICHELLE_BACHMAN -LRB- sp -RRB- FAN think ASPECT_WOMEN_LEADERS , on average , are better suited to govern with compassion , good ASPECT_SENSE and good ASPECT_WILL than men ; who are , on average , too quick to retaliate with force than with reason .
10898	2325	JFK was notable ASPECT_EXCEPTION when ENDOR decided , opposing ASPECT_ENDOR_MILITARY_ADVISORS , to ASPECT_NOT_invade ASPECT_CUBA !
10899	2325	Probably because ENDOR experienced hand futility of war .
10900	2325	Not so with GWB , who along with Dick ASPECT_CHENEY -LRB- aka ASPECT_DARTH_VADER -RRB- managed to evade draft for ASPECT_VIET_NAM .
10901	2325	Neither were exposed to horrors of war but eager to send others to ASPECT_OTHERS_DEATH to secure ASPECT_OIL_FIELDS of Iraq .
10902	2325	Neoconservatives are , above , obsessed with ASPECT_SECURING_WEALTH over human ASPECT_MISERY .
10903	2325	FAN recovered quickly from ASPECT_FAN_SENSE of `` injustice , not ASPECT_ANGER per se , and wrote recommendation for ASPECT_FAN_COMPETITOR , whom ASPECT_FAN knew and liked .
10904	2325	Today , THERAPIST is ASPECT_LICENSED_THERAPIST .
10905	2325	ASPECT_FAN_SENSE of injustice goes to ASPECT_SOCIAL_HYPOCRISY that FAN had man to pay ASPECT_FAN_TUITION when THERAPIST did not .
10906	2325	In ideal ASPECT_WORLD .
10907	2325	But , life is not ASPECT_MATHEMATIC_or ethical ASPECT_EQUATION and never will be .
10908	2325	So , why throw ASPECT_BABY_OUT with bath ASPECT_WATER ?
10909	2325	WATER would seem from polls and pundits that no ASPECT_ONE was satisfied with bill that passed .
10910	2325	BUT , if you agree that government CAN handle ASPECT_NATIONAL_HEALTH_CARE -- which BUT has done successfully in Medicare and ASPECT_VETERANS_HEALTH_CARE for decades -- then why not ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION puts net over ASPECT_INSURANCE_INDUSTRY to `` play fair ?
10911	2325	Plus , if ASPECT_INCOME_TAX and SS is mandatory , why is ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE not ASPECT_CONSTITUTIONAL ?
10912	2325	Especially , if TAX is designed for ASPECT_PUBLIC_GOOD ?
10913	2325	TAX collects from who receive `` income , not just for who can afford ASPECT_OUT-OF-CONTROL_PREMIUMS .
10914	2325	You may be sincere here , but your `` ASPECT_INSIGHT into ASPECT_WOMAN_and ASPECT_JOAN_AMBITIONS is flawed and without strong ASPECT_FOUNDATION .
10915	2325	JOAN is n't Joan of Arc or ASPECT_MOTHER_THERESA .
10916	2325	JOAN opportunistic ASPECT_FRAUD .
10917	2325	action JOAN taken is prime ASPECT_EXAMPLE of ASPECT_SELF_centered ASPECT_WEALTH_based ASPECT_AMBITION .
10918	2325	people can be self-educated , but JOAN does n't even read newspapers .
10919	2325	JOAN has skill with `` ASPECT_QUIP but ASPECT_TINA_FEY characterization of Palin as beauty ASPECT_PAGEANT_CANDIDATE is spot on .
10920	2325	If JOAN were blonde , JOAN 'd be called `` dumb ASPECT_BLONDE .
10921	2325	`` Go to ASPECT_PAGE_2 for response to rest of your ASPECT_POST .
10922	2326	I know , it 's great
10923	2327	is conclusion solely based on your Christian ASPECT_IDEOLOGY .
10924	2327	Yes , Palin , at point in time can well afford to care for her disabled ASPECT_CHILD .
10925	2327	But , CHILD is n't `` relying on Lord to provide care as of of Christian ASPECT_FAITH expect woman to do .
10926	2327	ASPECT_ANTI-ABORTION_ADVOCATES will encourage and even aid CHILD to CHILD ASPECT_DECISION to birth baby , but CHILD 's on CHILD after .
10927	2327	Hardly `` ASPECT_CHRISTIAN to do .
10928	2327	Nor are ADVOCATES willing to `` adopt child to raise , educate until it is able to survive on .
10929	2327	No , ASPECT_NO let `` government do .
10931	2327	Is n't ASPECT_CASE of pot calling ASPECT_KETTLE_BLACK ?
10932	2327	May suggest you honor your ASPECT_JUDGMENT applied to SOME .
10933	2327	agree , `` libraries are better than others .
10934	2327	's true of sources on internet as well .
10935	2327	But , who can use computer can save time by using COMPUTER and internet to research and learn .
10936	2327	COMPUTER is tool .
10937	2327	COMPUTER can be weapon .
10938	2327	Like man made tools , ASPECT_COMPUTER_BEST used with ASPECT_CAUTION_, ASPECT_REASON_and ASPECT_INTELLIGENCE .
10939	2328	Care to expand on statement MD ?
10940	2328	I am speaking of sentence .
10941	2328	~ rr ~ Perhaps ~ will answer from his\/her ASPECT_UNDERSTANDING , but I 've heard before where Neoconservatism can be summed up pretty as ASPECT_FOLLOWS : Borrow and spend because deficits do n't matter !
10942	2329	Once again for your ASPECT_ENJOYMENT `` From day of ASPECT_GEORGE_WASHINGTON Presidency through day of ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON Presidency , YOUR racked up of 5 ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS of ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT .
10943	2329	was too ASPECT_SPENDING !
10944	2329	Then ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH took over , and increased ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT from 5 ASPECT_TRILLION left by Clinton , to 10 ASPECT_TRILLION at end of Bush 8 ASPECT_YEARS .
10945	2329	Bush , in 8 ASPECT_YEARS , equaled OVERspending by Presidents before BUSH .
10946	2329	is terrible .
10947	2329	Then obamalama comes in in ASPECT_JAN_2009 with ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT of 10 ASPECT_TRILLION .
10948	2329	Now NOW ASPECT_JAN_2011 , ASPECT_TWO_YEARS_LATER , and ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT stands at 14 ASPECT_TRILLION .
10949	2329	In 2 ASPECT_YEARS 2 has equaled 80 of awful ASPECT_AMOUNT_BUSH spent , and also equaled 80 of Presidents combined from Clinton back to Washington .
10950	2329	Congressional Budget ASPECT_OFFICE -LRB- CBO -RRB- projects ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT will be 18 ASPECT_TRILLION at end of 2015 .
10951	2329	Not ASPECT_FOX , not Republicans , but CBO .
10952	2329	And CBO is projecting because of `` proposed ASPECT_SPENDING_REDUCTIONS .
10953	2329	ASPECT_MATHEMATICAL_PROJECTION at today rate of spending is 22 ASPECT_TRILLION of ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT by end of 2015 .
10954	2329	22,000,000,000,000.002015 And what did obamalama choose to talk about in ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_STATE of ASPECT_UNION_CAMPAIGN_SPEECH ?
10955	2329	` Investments ! '
10956	2329	means Govt spending , when we have only little ASPECT_LESS than 00.60 ASPECT_CENTS for dollar WE are spending .
10957	2329	Meaning , dollar WE spend , WE have to borrow bit over 00.40 ASPECT_CENTS .
10958	2329	How hard could MEANING be to find can do better than incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN ?
10959	2330	ME am happy you spread blame where BLAME belongs , is not partisan ASPECT_ISSUE , BLAME survival ASPECT_ISSUE !
10960	2330	said , is n't debt terrifying ?
10961	2330	ME mean DEBT absoultely ASPECT_HORRIFYING !
10962	2330	or ASPECT_MAYBE of ASPECT_ME_virtual and ASPECT_REGULAR_FRIENDS think ME am ASPECT_BIT_ECCENTRIC as ME build ME ASPECT_NEW_HOME\/OFFICE to double as ` ASPECT_BUG out ' ASPECT_SHELTER of sorts .
10963	2330	building -LRB- Church and ASPECT_MISSION_OFFICES -RRB- and despite is fully off ASPECT_GRID_CAPABLE , ASPECT_SELF_SUFFICIENT in ASPECT_ELECTRICAL_POWER , including ASPECT_HEATING_and ASPECT_COOLING and can support two ASPECT_ADULTS for over ASPECT_YEAR without restocking .
10964	2330	ME am not nut but rather simply endowed with inability to stick ASPECT_ME_HEAD in sand , and perhaps more important ASPECT_ME am blessed with normal ASPECT_DOSE of ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE .
10965	2330	NUT 's obvious me that we can not sustain anywhere near level of spending that WE seem to think is normal !
10966	2330	ME would urge everyone get prepared with survival ASPECT_PLAN_and ASPECT_OPTIONS should worst ASPECT_HAPPEN .
10967	2330	God bless of you .
10968	2330	ASPECT_~_RR ~
10969	2331	You are welcome here !
10970	2331	Great ASPECT_MINDS think alike !
10971	2331	ASPECT_~_RR ~
10972	2332	Yes I agree .
10973	2332	BTW I will reply to your rebuttal ASPECT_ASAP .
10974	2332	I need ASPECT_COUPLD_HOURS to nod ~ ASPECT_RR ~
10975	2333	ASPECT_HI_SASSY , LIBERTARIAN did n't have time to edit for grammar so LIBERTARIAN hope THING Legible !
10976	2333	LIBERTARIAN am so very aware of falsehood and FALSEHOOD simply ASPECT_PARANOIA often and , with due respect ASPECT_FALSEHOOD &#8217; s ASPECT_RANK_FALSEHOOD .
10977	2333	LIBERTARIAN have heard FALSEHOOD so often LIBERTARIAN know where you are going with .
10978	2333	Even if recipients of theistic ASPECT_GIVING receives ASPECT_HUGE_DOSE of religion with goodies , RECIPIENTS still definitely are getting assistance ASPECT_ETC !
10979	2333	Your ASPECT_LOGIC is so fallible in statement that LIBERTARIAN nearly didn &#8217; read rest of your ASPECT_REPLY , except to give cursory ASPECT_GLANCE and dumbed down reply .
10980	2333	However LIBERTARIAN took chance that you were not being totally malicious and decided to give your ASPECT_REPLY benefit of doubt and LIBERTARIAN am happy ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN did , because you made good ASPECT_POINTS .
10981	2333	Well ASPECT_SCHOOL_CHILDREN know that Christian ASPECT_MISSIONARIES are ASPECT_UMM_&#8217;_&#8230; .
10982	2333	Christian ASPECT_MISSIONARIES !
10983	2333	&#8230; &#8217; s not like S are going to get ambushed , or given small ASPECT_POX infected blankets along with what would Jesus do \/ love your ASPECT_FELLOW_MAN_TRACT !
10984	2333	is repetitively harped ASPECT_MESSAGE_&#8230; would be comical ASPECT_SASSY !
10985	2333	If LIBERTARIAN ASPECT_OFFER_ASSISTANCE by LIBERTARIAN ASPECT_MISSIONS yes LIBERTARIAN may exposed to awful ASPECT_THINGS including but not limited seeing bible on LIBERTARIAN ASPECT_DESK or bit of scripture on walls .
10986	2333	You may even be asked to come to church , however you wont be bushwhacked from out of blue !
10987	2333	comes to church knows that they just might be exposed to ASPECT_JESUS_STUFF !
10988	2333	good ASPECT_NEWS is -LRB- in addition to ASPECT_SCRIPTURE_-RRB- that secular ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS will charge cash for ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS_SERVICES_or ASPECT_FOOD_ETC. .
10989	2333	If you have no ASPECT_CASH you will starve or be denied services .
10990	2333	However , clients will not be turned away unless CLIENTS are danger to CLIENTS or staff .
10991	2333	-LRB- when LIBERTARIAN was up and running -RRB- .
10992	2333	Yes ASPECT_INDEEDY !
10993	2333	Giving ASPECT_STUFF away is unprofitable !
10994	2333	And you are failing again in your ASPECT_LOGIC .
10995	2333	taxpayers pay taxes , not just profitable ASPECT_TAXPAYERS , ha ASPECT_HA .
10997	2333	However LIBERTARIAN will say that missions could be seen endeavor in socialism .
10998	2333	&#8217; s given ASPECT_EH ?
10999	2333	In fact Jesus would be communist if JESUS were alive today .
11000	2333	However LIBERTARIAN already replied to your ASPECT_CONCERNS .
11001	2333	LIBERTARIAN said that LIBERTARIAN am not libertarian in respect , LIBERTARIAN went to pains to point that out .
11002	2333	LIBERTARIAN believe that because of perversion of society which was accomplished by embracing paradigm of progressive ASPECT_LIBERALISM and by accepting logical ASPECT_POSITIVISM -LRB- over metaphysics -RRB- we are forced to adopt tenets of socialism .
11003	2333	ASPECT_EARLY_CHURCH was form of socialism .
11004	2333	LIBERTARIAN have never said socialism is bad have LIBERTARIAN ?
11005	2333	There is no black and ASPECT_WHITE in anything in ASPECT_TEMPORAL_UNIVERSE , -LRB- ASPECT_IE_WE_tangible ASPECT_UNIVERSE_-RRB- .
11006	2333	Trust ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN , ASPECT_EVERYTHING_RESIDES in shades of black and ASPECT_WHITE , is provable to accuracy of 100 .
11007	2333	-LRB- is not ASPECT_STRAW_MAN_CLAIM_but ASPECT_CLAIM &#8217; s close due to ASPECT_GODEL_UNIVERSES and beautifully strange ASPECT_WAY ASPECT_QUANTUM_WORLD behaves due to ASPECT_UNCERTAINTY_and ASPECT_NON-LOCALITY_ETC. -RRB- You must know that if you earn MA in theology you have ASPECT_SEMESTER_HOURS in philosophy than in nearly ASPECT_FIELD .
11008	2333	LIBERTARIAN ASPECT_HAVE and LIBERTARIAN do .
11009	2333	You should not make claims in ASPECT_PUBLIC_FORUM_SASSY .
11010	2333	Again not things are black and white .
11011	2333	Personally LIBERTARIAN think you may should allow yourself to accept anything given freely without guilt and or ASPECT_ANGER .
11012	2333	We agree again .
11013	2333	If WE could know 100 of variables in precise ASPECT_MOMENT of calculation ASPECT_WE could know everything about anything , and not even God can or chooses to know that about universe .
11014	2333	And without going off ASPECT_TOPIC_MOMENT that very ASPECT_CONCEPT that God chooses not to know or ASPECT_LIKELY can not know to accuracy of 100 variables constitutes universe gives ASPECT_WE_free ASPECT_WILL .
11015	2333	You bring up good ASPECT_POINTS .
11016	2333	Personally , LIBERTARIAN believe IRS and taxes , including ASPECT_INCOME_TAX are illegal !
11017	2333	Adding another ASPECT_WRONG to bath ASPECT_WATER ie ASPECT_OBAMAS_HEALTH_CARE_BABY_DOLL only reinforces bad ASPECT_BEHAVIOR .
11018	2333	So LIBERTARIAN say that yes , we should throw dead ASPECT_BABY_DOLL out with bath ASPECT_WATER !
11019	2333	ASPECT_LASTLY_LIBERTARIAN should say that having to pay taxes etc isn &#8217; t as being forced to buy PRODUCT .
11020	2333	reasons come to mind not least ASPECT_BEING that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE may not stand up to constitutional ASPECT_MUSTER !
11021	2333	Well you must understand that when LIBERTARIAN read her ASPECT_BIO_LIBERTARIAN saw woman more accomplished that .
11022	2333	HER is much more accomplished than of that criticizes -LRB- LIBERTARIAN should say crucifies ASPECT_HER_-RRB- .
11023	2333	Additionally , LIBERTARIAN highly admire ASPECT_HER_moral ASPECT_VALUES ie ASPECT_HER_Christianity ASPECT_ETC. .
11024	2333	Of ASPECT_COURSE_PEOPLE would write HER off precisely because HER is Christian and is pro ASPECT_LIFE .
11025	2333	pro ASPECT_CHOICE do not really understand or believe pro ASPECT_LIFE_PEOPLE and is shame , but that in and of OF is another ASPECT_THREAD -LRB- abortion , morals ASPECT_ETC -RRB- ra
11026	2334	You certainly have queer ASPECT_IDEAS about ASPECT_CHRISTIANS_SASSY !
11027	2334	Christians consider lord grants station in life .
11028	2334	do n't thinking that God will provide only after death but 's not what ASPECT_SCRIPTURE tells .
11029	2334	YOU think that maybe you ought to brush up on Christian ASPECT_FAITH if you plan to debate subjects deal with theology , particularly Christianity .
11030	2334	Again , you are very wrong about as ASPECT_WELL .
11031	2334	There are Christian support ASPECT_GROUPS than secular ASPECT_GROUPS , additionally church would support her at least GROUPS would in ASPECT_CASES .
11032	2334	YOU church is not true ASPECT_CHURCH , as YOU do not preach except as in ASPECT_GUEST_CAPACITY .
11033	2334	However , church of YOU youth has provided for members that fell upon hard ASPECT_TIMES , as ` ASPECT_BIKER_' ASPECT_CHURCH that YOU regularly attend .
11034	2334	Ummm ' ASPECT_YOU goggled for Christian free ASPECT_SERVICES for mentally handicapped disabled ASPECT_CHILDREN and received so ASPECT_HITS that YOU could not fit CHILDREN on page .
11035	2334	Therefore , YOU tried pasting CHILDREN to ASPECT_WORD_PROCESSOR_DOCUMENT and received error ASPECT_MESSAGE saying listings exceeded capability of WP !
11036	2334	YOU guess rather shoots your ASPECT_CLAIMS down .
11037	2334	Next YOU Goggled atheist ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS offered free ASPECT_SERVICES for children etc etc. .
11038	2334	YOU could fit of them on ... ummm ... on ... ahhh ' ASPECT_MATCHBOOK_COVER !
11039	2334	You are assuming that mother does not take child !
11040	2334	Ha ha in fact you are so off base that YOU am beginning to wonder what your ASPECT_AGENDA is .
11041	2334	sad ASPECT_FACT of matter is that YOU think you really think claims are true .
11042	2334	YOU am astonished that so ASPECT_DISINFORMATION\/PROPAGANDA exists .
11043	2334	Apparently , successful ASPECT_PROPAGANDA has convinced normally intelligent ASPECT_PEOPLE like yourself that lies are truth .
11044	2334	YOU do .
11045	2334	Where have YOU been to come out of blue and wrongly accuse you of anything ?
11046	2334	Well yes you are correct , YOU use computer too much simply take YOU chances .
11047	2334	So , we can agree on items , which is good ASPECT_INDICATOR that WE can discuss issues without ASPECT_ARGUMENT_or ASPECT_DISCUSSION becoming toxic .
11048	2334	biggest ASPECT_CRITICISM YOU have of your ASPECT_REPLIES is that you made quite ASPECT_NON-SOURCED_and ASPECT_UNSUBSTANTIATED_CLAIMS , which were reworded are old atheist ASPECT_STANDBYS or worse , however even worst ASPECT_ONES have n't damaged your ASPECT_CREDIBILITY .
11049	2334	YOU know that you have criticisms for YOU as well !
11051	2335	Right now interest on debt is at historically and ridiculously low ASPECT_LEVELS .
11052	2335	Lucky for .
11053	2335	ASPECT_EU_COUNTRIES have gone beyond terrible debt ASPECT_LEVELS are now paying OVER ASPECT_11 on debt .
11054	2335	While 5 t0 8 would be normal interest ASPECT_RATE for to be paying , is not ASPECT_PRESENT_CASE .
11055	2335	But imagine if were paying 7 on debt .
11056	2335	NOT unusually ASPECT_HIGH_RATE .7 14 ASPECT_TRILLION = 980,000,000,000.00 .
11057	2335	980 billion ASPECT_DOLLARS_INTEREST .
11058	2335	than Medicare\/Medicaid .
11059	2335	than ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY .
11060	2335	than Defense ASPECT_DEPT. .
11061	2335	Even at very low ASPECT_RATE of interest , interest ASPECT_AMOUNT is ASPECT_SINGLE_largest ASPECT_EXPENSE have NOW !
11062	2335	While ASPECT_M\/M_or ASPECT_SS or DD are higher ASPECT_TOTALS , they are covering ASPECT_MULTIPLE_AGENCIES\/DEPTS .
11063	2335	and ASPECT_MULTIPLE_PROGRAMS .
11064	2335	Interest is ASPECT_SINGLE_LINE , and already highest ASPECT_SINGLE_LINE .
11065	2336	Well you will read detailed ASPECT_REPORT , but basically REPORT eliminates avoidable ASPECT_TAXES -LRB- well none should be avoidable , but ... -RRB- one ASPECT_TAX they ca n't avoid is ASPECT_SALES_TAX because THEY have to buy things .
11066	2336	I mean Wal-Mart would be one of best ASPECT_EXAMPLES of where THEY would HAVE to pay taxes .
11067	2336	ASPECT_SALES_TAX would be possibly shockingly high , around ASPECT_30 if I 'm not mistaken -LRB- gotta ASPECT_CHECK that -RRB- and ASPECT_TAX would , in theory make up for lost ASPECT_TAXES .
11068	2336	Ca n't avoid ASPECT_SALES_TAX or else you have no ASPECT_FOOD_, ASPECT_CLOTHES_, ASPECT_TECHNOLOGY_, ASPECT_COSMETICS_, ASPECT_ETC. ...
11069	2337	If one pays taxes , one is deemed `` profitable , because they have income over expenses .
11070	2337	`` Non-profit means exactly , `` no ASPECT_INCOME over expenses .
11071	2337	If you do , you pay tax or get `` ASPECT_TAX_CREDIT that `` forgives overage up to ASPECT_CERTAIN_AMOUNT .
11072	2337	I do n't disagree with your ASPECT_POSIT .
11073	2337	NO ASPECT_IDEA is concrete .
11074	2337	And , 's very ASPECT_FOUNDATION of philosophy .
11075	2337	What seems to be , just may not be .
11076	2337	's also foundation of ASPECT_SCIENTIFIC_THEORY and why theory must be replicated over and over before it is justified to be used as matter of fact .
11077	2337	Except `` ASPECT_RELIGION is basis for study .
11078	2337	Why not ?
11079	2337	Not necessarily `` capable just `` ASPECT_AWARE of how hard ASPECT_JUST is to grow and bear child and then lose life of child to is avoidable .
11080	2337	Children are priority for women .
11081	2337	I do n't think majority of men think way , tho ' I 'm also sure do .
11082	2337	I do not presume to know what ASPECT_GOD thinks , chooses to know or not know .
11083	2337	I do take for I ASPECT_PERSONAL_PHILOSOPHY teachings found in NT .
11084	2337	I believe inhumanity of humanity toward humanity is barbaric , founded in perverted , distorted prime ASPECT_IMPERATIVE `` to survive .
11085	2337	Human ASPECT_BEINGS have intellectual ASPECT_ABILITY to `` see beyond selfish , egocentric ASPECT_INSTINCTS and can reason together to achieve `` ASPECT_WIN-WIN_GOAL for ASPECT_PUBLIC_GOOD .
11086	2340	True that .
11087	2340	ASPECT_CONSUMERS_TAX .
11088	2340	No ASPECT_TAXES on anything else except consumer ASPECT_GOODS .
11089	2340	Have you found links to support 30 ASPECT_FIGURE .
11090	2340	I 'd be interested in reading .
11091	2341	Imagine that programs you pay taxes to support were to become voluntary .
11092	2341	In words , instead of sending money to mongrels through threat of prosecution , you decide what programs you want to support and how money that you want to send to support MONGRELS .
11093	2341	idea being that you are careful spending your ASPECT_MONEY than politicians are .
11094	2341	result would be next to no ASPECT_SPENDING by fed ASPECT_GOV outside of defense and infusion of your ASPECT_CASH locally .
11095	2341	is very simplified ASPECT_VERSION of what ASPECT_RON_PAUL has been saying for thirty ASPECT_YEARS .
11096	2341	To learn very detailed ASPECT_VERSION , go to ASPECT_PAUL_WEBSITE -LRB- there are -RRB- .
11097	2341	Fair ASPECT_TAX , consumer ASPECT_TAX , etc. are just different ASPECT_NAMES for .
11098	2341	pols will not turn loose of money if you do n't make POLS .
11099	2341	Check LOOSE out .
11100	2341	You having control of your ASPECT_INCOME - what novel ASPECT_IDEA .
11102	2341	I would like to try CRAZY and see .
11103	2343	Have n't had too ASPECT_TIME .
11104	2343	Will try by tomorrow .
11105	2344	No ASPECT_WAY !
11106	2344	still after two ASPECT_YEARS and being ASPECT_ACTIVE_DEMOCRAT , I will not vote for DEMOCRAT !
11108	2346	Interesting figures .
11109	2346	Scary ASPECT_FIGURES .
11110	2346	What would happen if WE -LRB- ASPECT_USA_-RRB- said ` no ASPECT_WE will not pay ASPECT_WE_DEBT off ? '
11111	2346	And that ` and attempt to collect payment will result in war !
11113	2347	You were -LRB- are -RRB- democrat ?
11114	2347	ASPECT_HA_HA 's ok Jollee , YOU vote issues -LRB- and not ASPECT_PARTY_LINE_-RRB- as well .
11116	2349	I sincerely hope that Palin does not run .
11117	2349	She does best ASPECT_STAYING on sidelines and annoying libs .
11118	2350	move would require that we immediately cut ASPECT_FEDERAL_and ASPECT_STATE_SPENDING by TRILLIONS of dollars since WE would no longer be able to borrow money at rate .
11119	2350	Might be worth try !!!
11120	2350	Also would result in ASPECT_RECALL_or ASPECT_IMPEACHMENT_MOVEMENTS since bulk of ASPECT_WE_DEBT is owed to US citizens .
11121	2352	How about ASPECT_BILLY_CLUB ???
11122	2353	Not even `` ASPECT_BILLY_BEER .
11123	2354	would go unfunded would be Department of Defense !
11124	2355	Not that are so stupid to think world is filled with nice ASPECT_PEOPLE .
11125	2355	30 ASPECT_MINUTE_STUDY of world ASPECT_HISTORY would tell you that DoD is one of vital ASPECT_DEPARTMENTS we have .
11126	2355	cuts might need to be made , but DoD is essential to ASPECT_WE_SURVIVAL as country and just as people .
11127	2356	http:\/\/www.fairtax.org\/site\/News2?ne...rticle&amp;id=8248Turns out RATE 's less than I thought : RATE would be 23 ASPECT_TAX_RATE , not 30 ASPECT_RATE .
11128	2356	Even better !
11129	2357	I 'm exploring that website now .
11130	2357	Enlightening ASPECT_READING so far .
11131	2358	I have ASPECT_SHIRT_SIMILAR to of your ASPECT_PHOTO_I.D. Mine says about ASPECT_BORDER_CONTROL and is relevant to yours
11132	2360	SHOULD not be is word .
11133	2360	Will he NOT be ?
11134	2360	's hard to discern at point .
11135	2361	True , we must maintain DoD to defend WE .
11136	2361	But what would be difference in costs of defending USA versus ASPECT_AMERICAN_EMPIRE .
11137	2361	costs would be in international corporate ASPECT_PROFITS ie haliburton !
11139	2363	I certainly hope that ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC will not be incredibly ASPECT_STUPID again .
11140	2363	And ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE ?
11141	2363	far in advance of 2008 ASPECT_ELECTIONS , obamalama was NOT ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_POSSIBILITY .
11142	2363	There is still time for candidate , not yet considered possibility , to emerge .
11143	2363	BHO did .
11144	2363	And imagine difference if obamalama has to run against STRONG ASPECT_CANDIDATE , is neither old nor carrying Bush ASPECT_BAGGAGE .
11145	2363	Whomever was ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CANDIDATE in 2008 was walkover .
11146	2363	BHO had to beat woman , 's .
11147	2363	All Democrats shot themselves in foot .
11148	2363	And McCain was ASPECT_SACRIFICIAL_LAMB .
11149	2363	Now obamalama will have to overcome OBAMALAMA failed policies and incredible ASPECT_DEBT ever run up by president ever .
11150	2363	OBAMALAMA is one will be dragging baggage coming ASPECT_ELECTION .
11151	2363	And 2 ASPECT_YEARS from now , ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_BULLCRAP of 2 ASPECT_YEARS will be even more revealed than YEARS is now .
11152	2364	I find it funny how libs bash ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT .
11154	2364	They stand for Constitutional ASPECT_GOVERNMENT , and are against big , wasteful ASPECT_GOVERNMENT .
11155	2364	THEY are Conservative ASPECT_MOVEMENT .
11156	2364	Everyone should be behind THEY .
11157	2365	of us are against deficits and like fact US do n't have hordes of aged , ASPECT_INFIRM and temporarily out of luck living under freeways begging at stoplights .
11158	2366	DEM consider you one of informed ASPECT_PEOPLE on right so DEM will not insult your ASPECT_INTELLIGENCE .
11159	2366	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY has good ASPECT_IDEA about getting ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING under control , -LRB- you know DEM am ASPECT_DEM_-RRB- .
11160	2366	But , like DEM can not join organization has racist ASPECT_OVERTONES .
11161	2366	DEM do not believe ASPECT_TEA_PARTIERS are racist , but accusation continues to be made , and ASPECT_TEA_PARTY has not rejected PARTY with vigor .
11162	2366	ACCUSATION takes is one ASPECT_PICTURE like , and ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_CREDIBILITY is gone for lot of people .
11163	2366	So , for like DEM ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is write-off .
11164	2367	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA was elected by maj. .
11166	2367	major ... majori .
11167	2367	. had votes !
11168	2367	When you wish upon star ... ... Dream on .
11169	2370	things can kill ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY .
11170	2370	And yes , Democrats experienced set back .
11171	2370	Time will show that unloading `` ASPECT_BLUE_DEMS was good because it is easier to target Republicans outside party than TIME is to have ASPECT_INTERNAL_STRUGGLE .
11172	2370	Fact is ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY does not even have contender for President .
11173	2370	Romney , Palin , Gingrich , Huckaby favorites of conservative ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_BASE .
11174	2370	In end Republicans will be smart enough not to nominate of them .
11175	2370	If ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA refused to run we have plethoria of qualified ASPECT_CANDIDATES , Clinton , Biden , Reid , Pelosi , and my favorite ASPECT_NEW_FACE , ASPECT_ANTHONY_WEINER .
11176	2370	Democrats have ASPECT_END_GAME .
11178	2371	ASPECT_IM_not ASPECT_HAPPY with of candidates ... though from what ASPECT_IVE heard of ASPECT_AW_I might consider AW ... BO will run again though ... I hope for ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE who is at least worthy ASPECT_CHALLENGER ... We shall see come ASPECT_ELECTION_2012
11179	2373	Quite frankly , I have seen racist .
11180	2373	`` Do n't tax ASPECT_DUDE_BRO was take on line drunk ASPECT_DUDE said to cop , `` Do n't taze ASPECT_DUDE_BRO .
11181	2373	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY-RACISM_LINK is non-existent , and has yet to be proven .
11182	2373	There are wackos in group , but WACKOS do not represent group .
11183	2374	Are you for Constitutional ASPECT_GOVERNMENT ?
11184	2375	You crack me up .
11185	2375	What flame-baiter !
11186	2376	Liberal ASPECT_SOP , play ASPECT_RACE_CARD .
11187	2376	photo comes from not just liberal ASPECT_SITE but progressive ASPECT_SITE .
11188	2376	site demeans ASPECT_TEA_PARTY in way PHOTO can .
11189	2376	And photo is from 3\/2010 ASPECT_OR_EARLIER .
11190	2376	ASPECT_VARIOUS_TEA_PARTY_GROUPS have denied racism and then liberal ASPECT_MEDIA_DELIGHTS in calling ASPECT_GROUPS_LIARS .
11191	2376	However ASPECT_TEA_PARTY spoke loud enough for independents to hear in ASPECT_NOV._2010 .
11192	2376	Liberals can not hear as LIBERALS are brainwashed into deafness and ASPECT_BLINDNESS .
11193	2376	But ASPECT_VAST_MAJORITY of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC do not suffer from liberal ASPECT_LOONINESS .
11194	2376	And where does ASPECT_PHOTO_ORIGINATE ?
11195	2376	AP , ASPECT_NY_TIMES ?
11196	2376	FOX , CNN ?
11197	2376	No FOX ASPECT_ORIGINATES with progressive ASPECT_SITE_FOX posted on .
11198	2376	, supposedly , racist ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_PHOTOS have been shown to be STAGED
11199	2378	Even that one is based on guy said , `` Do n't taze ASPECT_GUY_BRO , to ASPECT_WHITE_POLICE_OFFICER .
11200	2379	You seem to be ASPECT_BIT_SENSITIVE ... I have not seen racism with ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_PEOPLE , PEOPLE seem like good ASPECT_GROUP of people to I , people who have taken undo criticism ... GROUP actually sickening to see ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION_TALK negative of PEOPLE , GROUP disappointing ... Jollee
11201	2381	He was lying way back when HE was campaigning , ASPECT_WISH_PEOPLE had listened to HE more carefully ... We would be in allot better ASPECT_SHAPE now ...
11202	2383	Where were you ASPECT_GUYS in 2001 , or 2003 , when government was squandering budget ASPECT_SURPLUS and running up deficits with ASPECT_TAX_CUTS ?
11203	2383	But I agree Obama has been not aggressive enough on issue .
11204	2383	With country coming out of recession , it was mistake to cave to Republicans and let Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS run another two ASPECT_YEARS , which will push back meaningful ASPECT_PROGRESS on deficits .
11205	2383	Obama should also let Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS expire completely , and at 5-10 ASPECT_SURCHARGE on incomes over 1m to help redress damage Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS have caused , as well as ASPECT_TRIM_SPENDING .
11206	2384	Great ASPECT_BIT of facts .
11207	2384	Always wanted to know details , but never looked them up ... I would do one of recommend ASPECT_CREDIT_THINGS but I have no ASPECT_CLUE how ... know how ?
11208	2385	Tell you what .
11209	2385	You seem to be having problem understanding what thread is about , and my ASPECT_STATEMENTS .
11210	2385	So MY 'll dumb ASPECT_PROBLEM down for you .
11211	2385	word here is `` PERCEPTION .
11212	2385	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is `` PERCEIVED racist by people who might otherwise be interested in what they have to say .
11213	2385	You want to argue picture or picture .
11214	2385	Well , Google `` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , Racist , you will find no less than 1,980,000 ASPECT_WEB_SITES discuss problem !
11215	2385	would agree that ASPECT_WEB_SITES on subject indicates problem .
11216	2385	Here is link .
11217	2385	ASPECT_HTTP:\/\/WWW.GOOGLE.COM\/#SCLIENT=PSY&AMP;H...83DFE782E20CDC_NOW are you ready to discuss obvious problem or ASPECT_RACISM in ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , or are you going to continue to ignore reality ?
11218	2385	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_LEADER , ASPECT_DALE_ROBERTSON_HTTP:\/\/WWW.MEDIAITE.COM\/ONLINE\/TEA-P...R-N-WORD-SIGN\/HTTP:\/\/WWW.YOUTUBE.COM\/THEGRAMMYS?FEATURE=TICKERIT is really easy to go with ASPECT_BILL_MAHER on issue .
11219	2385	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY has ASPECT_PUBLIC_RELATIONS_NIGHT_MARE , and PARTY will bring them down as ASPECT_RACIST .
11220	2387	And now I 'll dumb ASPECT_NOW down for you .
11221	2387	ASPECT_LIBERALS_PERCIEVE_EVERYONE does not kowtow to liberal ASPECT_LINE as RACIST .
11222	2387	Liberals also believe that ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC is stupid and believes lies ASPECT_LIBERALS tell .
11223	2387	And left constantly insults ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC .
11224	2387	I 'm amazed that liberals do not realize that constant ASPECT_BARRAGE of , `` You do n't understand .
11225	2387	and , `` I did n't explain BARRAGE well enough .
11226	2387	ARE ASPECT_INSULTS to public intelligence .
11227	2387	And ASPECT_PUBLIC_DOES_UNDERSTAND and liberals explained ASPECT_LIBERALS_POSITION to boredom .
11228	2387	We know what you 're saying and WE do n't like DOES and WE disagree .
11229	2387	What ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is is famous `` Silent ASPECT_MAJORITY no longer being silent .
11230	2387	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY got lot of people elected in November and WILL get people elected in 2012 .
11231	2387	Democrats WILL lose control of of Congress in 2012 .
11232	2387	And obamalama phony ASPECT_MOVE to center will not hold up to ASPECT_SCRUTINY for 2 ASPECT_YEARS .
11233	2387	reality is that ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is effective and liberals are trying ASPECT_EVERYTHING_LIBERALS can to smear REALITY .
11234	2387	's reality .
11235	2387	Another ASPECT_REALITY is that 99 of ASPECT_NEWS_MEDIA is liberal ASPECT_LEFTIST_and ASPECT_LIBERALS_PRINT and broadcast but ASPECT_SLURS_and ASPECT_CLAIMS of racism by ASPECT_TEA_PARTY .
11236	2387	of ends up on ASPECT_LINE so REALITY is no ASPECT_SURPRISE that junk is repeated 2 million ASPECT_TIMES .
11237	2387	But couple of ASPECT_UNSUBSTANTIATED_STORIES repeated 2 million ASPECT_TIMES is NOT 2 million ASPECT_EXAMPLES .
11238	2387	ASPECT_MILLION_JUST couple of liberal lies repeated ASPECT_AD_NAUSEUM .
11239	2389	ASPECT_BILL_MAHER is misinformed ASPECT_MORON .
11240	2389	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT is not racist .
11241	2389	There are folks from walks of life in movement .
11242	2389	folks should be , but I guess liberals like living in bloated , bureaucratic ASPECT_PIPE_DREAM .
11243	2389	Racism is always used by liberals when there really is no ASPECT_ARGUMENT .
11244	2391	is ASPECT_ASSININE_STATEMENT .
11245	2391	Show me one ASPECT_POST of ME where ME 've called RACIST for not kowtowing to liberal ASPECT_LINE .
11246	2391	ME 'll dumb POST down for you .
11247	2391	Your ASPECT_ARGUMENTS are based on strawman .
11248	2392	Best ASPECT_QUOTE I have heard in time .
11249	2392	Sooo accurate .
11250	2392	Yet again , I would like to give recommendation but I do n't know how ...
11251	2393	Thanx for recommendation ASPECT_THINGY .
11252	2393	I doan no how to doit ether .
11253	2393	Ah is technochallenged .
11254	2395	Seriously ... Being relatively close to middle myself and going to rallies for both ASPECT_PARTIES -LRB- obviously separate ASPECT_ELECTIONS -RRB- ASPECT_I can see PARTIES view point .
11256	2395	Both ASPECT_SIDES are too far apart and there is no `` ASPECT_MIDDLE_CANDIDATE so we are forced to choose between -LRB- ASPECT_SOUTH_PARK_REFERENCE_-RRB- turd ASPECT_SANDWICH or -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- .
11258	2395	Neither will help you and both will screw you .
11259	2395	Why vote if you 're screwed either ASPECT_WAY ?
11261	2397	YES ... .
11262	2399	Careful there ASPECT_JOSEPH , with your ASPECT_VIEWS on illegals you could be painted with Brush ... But BRUSH 's good ASPECT_CAUSE they are ASPECT_YOUR_VIEWS ... There is no ASPECT_RACISM with ASPECT_THEY_THEN group , and probably less then with ASPECT_MINORITY_GROUPS ...
11263	2402	They ca n't tell who you voted for .
11264	2402	So you can add another ASPECT_VOTE to ASPECT_NO_COLUMN ...
11265	2403	Why would I vote no ?
11266	2404	Why would you vote yes ?
11267	2405	Volumes of reasons .
11268	2405	Here is .
11269	2405	ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE where billions of dollars were thrown at problem , unresolved .
11270	2405	financial ASPECT_CRISIS , process and results as above .
11271	2405	economy also had over trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS thrown at CRISIS .
11272	2405	economy improves very slowly without shred of positive ASPECT_PROOF that trillion plus ASPECT_DOLLARS poured in have anything to do with recovery .
11273	2405	Economies do EVENTUALLY recover on .
11274	2405	We are now in `` eventually ASPECT_STAGE .
11275	2405	Unemployment at or over 9 for longer than president in history of country , ASPECT_WHILE_SPENDING money than president in history of country .
11276	2405	ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT at end of Clinton ASPECT_FULL_fiscal ASPECT_YEAR , 5.674 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11277	2405	ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT at end of Bush ASPECT_EIGHT_YEARS IN OFFICE , 10.024 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11278	2405	TERRIBLE ASPECT_INCREASE of 4.35 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11279	2405	accumulated ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT from ASPECT_GEORGE_WASHINGTON through ASPECT_GEORGE_W._BUSH ASPECT_FULL_fiscal ASPECT_YEAR .
11280	2405	10.024 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11281	2405	accumulated ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT now after just over ASPECT_TWO_YEARS OF obamalama , 14.168 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11282	2405	incredible , insane ASPECT_INCREASE of 4.144 ASPECT_TRILLION in just over ASPECT_TWO_YEARS .
11283	2405	`` ASPECT_MERE_206 billion ASPECT_ADDED to debt and obamalama will surpass Bush terrible 8 ASPECT_YEARS of spending in WELL ASPECT_UNDER_3 ASPECT_YEARS .
11284	2405	's why to say NO to idiot incompetent ASPECT_OBAMALAMA .
11285	2405	OBAMALAMA makes Carter , Nixon , and Bush look good by comparison and they STUNK .
11286	2406	There 's lots of evidence it worked great .
11287	2406	economy stopped tanking at -7 and is growing for year .
11288	2406	economy stopped losing 700,000 ASPECT_JOBS month and ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR has created jobs month for year .
11289	2406	ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET stopped tanking and is up about 90 .
11290	2406	Even ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT , always lagging ASPECT_INDICATOR , is improving .
11291	2406	invested in failure for ASPECT_POLITICAL_PURPOSES could possibly say that there is no ASPECT_EVIDENCE_GOVERNMENT_INTERVENTION worked .
11292	2406	Without FAILURE in likelihood we 'd be in ASPECT_THIRD_YEAR of depression .
11293	2407	To quote : `` Without it in likelihood `` Was Freudian or admission that you do n't know ?
11294	2407	FACT that both YOU and I can see is that after blowing TRILLIONS , economy is still flat .
11295	2407	unemployment is still high .
11296	2407	banks are not lending .
11297	2407	ASPECT_HOUSING_FORECLOSURES are still terrible .
11298	2407	Is UNEMPLOYMENT better for blowing trillions of dollars or worse for doing so .
11299	2407	Would UNEMPLOYMENT be better had we not ASPECT_BLOWN_TRILLIONS that WE do not have or would UNEMPLOYMENT be worse .
11300	2407	Neither ASPECT_YOU nor I can provide factual ASPECT_PROOF_one ASPECT_WAY or another .
11301	2407	YOU only example of reckless ASPECT_SPENDING and ASPECT_MASSIVE_GOVERNMENT_INTERVENTION is FDR back in Depression .
11302	2407	FDR took 15 ASPECT_YEARS and World ASPECT_WAR to pull YOU out of .
11303	2407	Was Depression that bad , or did ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_intrusion ASPECT_CAUSE_INTRUSION to last so long ?
11304	2407	And obamalama recession compares with Reagan , not with Depression .
11305	2407	Neither ASPECT_REAGAN nor BHO recession were fault so I 'm not blaming REAGAN for recession , just gross ASPECT_MISMANAGEMENT of RECESSION .
11306	2407	What we FACTUALLY have as evidence is that WE are 4,144,000,000,000.00 ASPECT_FURTHER in debt than WE were .
11307	2407	And ASPECT_HOUSING_, ASPECT_FINANCE , and unemployment still awful .
11308	2407	Remember , summer was TO BE , `` Summer of Recovery , according to Biden .
11309	2407	ASPECT_WHAT_RECOVERY ?
11310	2409	Just look at who is `` presenting opinions as facts .
11311	2409	Kessy_Athena : Do n't ever apologize to DanNO40 because KESSY_ATHENA has n't manners or ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE to understand discussion\/debate can ever `` trump ASPECT_DISCUSSION\/DEBATE_`` ASPECT_OPINIONS , even when you quote unimpeachable , unbiased ASPECT_SOURCES .
11312	2409	I know .
11313	2409	I 've tried .
11314	2409	KESSY_ATHENA too old , too retired and too set in ASPECT_KESSY_ATHENA_WAYS to ever be open minded again .
11315	2409	Yeah , and for part they were ASPECT_ALLLLLLLL_REPUBLICANS who had 6 ASPECT_YEARS to deal with problems and decided it was more important to start 2 ASPECT_WARS and annihilate treasury because THEY wanted to monopolize oil in ME for ASPECT_THEY_RICH , ASPECT_NEOCON_CRONIES .
11316	2409	ASPECT_HOW_VERY ASPECT_QUICK_CONSERVATIVES ARE TO FORGET !
11317	2409	CONSERVATIVES just LOVE to change history !!!!!!!!!
11318	2409	CONSERVATIVES gave ASPECT_HUMONGOUS_TAX_BREAKS to rich and ASPECT_HUMONGOUS_CORPORATIONS paid\/pay NO ASPECT_TAX AT !
11319	2409	Examples : GE , Bank of America , ASPECT_BP_ET .
11321	2409	ASPECT_OIL_PRODUCERS still get subsidies in spite of polluting Gulf of Mexico where oil still lies 4 ASPECT_INCHES deep on floor of gulf .
11322	2409	None of SPITE on floor has been `` eaten by bacteria as promised ASPECT_AND as far as of us knows , bottom of Gulf is DEAD !
11324	2409	Why are you still conservative ?
11325	2409	ASPECT_BRATBOY_BUSH allowed BUSH ASPECT_WALL_STREET_BUDDIES to do BUDDIES dirty ASPECT_DEALS and then handed CONSERVATIVE ASPECT_OVER to Obama , who now must `` deal with ASPECT_WHITE_COLLAR_MULTIBILLIONAIRES who took ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS to cleaners by trashing ASPECT_CLEANERS_PENSION_FUNDS with bogus `` synthetic ASPECT_SECURITIES .
11326	2409	Just like `` ASPECT_RICHIES who invested with ASPECT_BERNIE_MADOFF , ASPECT_PENSION_FUNDS got greedy and Bush ASPECT_SEC_CRONIES fired ASPECT_BROOKSLIE_BORN for blowing whistle on CRONIES .
11327	2409	Why not ?
11328	2409	MADOFF just stupid ASPECT_WOMAN is n't WOMAN ?
11329	2409	And , everybody knows women have no ASPECT_SENSE for figures except for MADOFF was born with .
11330	2409	Once again , I agree with you .
11331	2409	When you quote figures from CBO -LRB- tho ' estimated -RRB- , I take heed .
11332	2409	However , you conservatives only take heed when CBO gives you you agree with .
11333	2409	But , you 're to blow `` sour when you do n't agree with CONSERVATIVES .
11334	2409	But , then , conservatives are just like ASPECT_MOBY_DICK , you `` blow hard against hard ASPECT_FACTS when wind is n't to your ASPECT_LIKING !!!
11335	2410	Thank you for unrelenting ASPECT_PERSONAL_ATTACK .
11336	2410	sad ASPECT_FACT , not ASPECT_OPINION , is your ASPECT_ATTACK is nearly devoid of FACTS .
11337	2410	But loaded with liberal ASPECT_BRAINWASHED_OPINIONS .
11338	2410	for instance : Republicans under Bush , you ASPECT_CAN_NOT find post with I defending .
11339	2410	However just as obamalama did not cause recession , NEITHER did Bush .
11340	2410	financial and ASPECT_HOUSING_CRISES were caused almost equally by politicians of both ASPECT_PARTIES .
11341	2410	Passing bills that caused ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE and repealing laws would have prevented insane financial ASPECT_MANIPULATIONS went on .
11342	2410	of your so called synthetic ASPECT_SECURITIES can be laid at feet of politicians of both ASPECT_PARTIES long before Bush got to DC .
11343	2410	And there is ample ASPECT_EVIDENCE that Bush warned about BUSH and made attempts to correct BUSH .
11344	2410	But ASPECT_ENTRENCHED_POLITICIANS , & , would not allow .
11345	2410	So your misguided and historically inaccurate ASPECT_ATTEMPT to lay off on johnny come lately Republicans is just repeating lies that liberals have taught you to tell .
11346	2410	problems were festering before you became aware of politics at all , other than perhaps ASPECT_SUBJECT in ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_CURRICULUM .
11347	2410	Republicans are ASPECT_NOT_INNOCENT in causes of today problems and neither are Democrats .
11348	2410	So I do not fault ASPECT_OBAMA for ASPECT_PRESENT_CRISIS , but I fault him for outrageously expensive and inept ASPECT_WAY HIM has `` attempted to fix problem .
11349	2410	Maybe I forget ?
11350	2410	What HIM did was get ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL passed .
11351	2410	Which was SUPPOSED to be for `` ASPECT_SHOVEL_ready ASPECT_PROJECTS , but now know NOW was ASPECT_STATE_BAILOUT_BILL .
11352	2410	ASPECT_POLITICAL_PAYBACK , more , but to tune of ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS .
11353	2410	Once HIM had ` shoveled ' Stimulus on , HIM then IGNORED economy entirely for going on ASPECT_TWO_YEARS , while HIM exhausted ASPECT_HIM_POLITICAL_CAPITAL on passing ASPECT_OBAMALAMACARE .
11354	2410	And with control of both ASPECT_HOUSES of ASPECT_CONGRESS_HIM had to stoop to bribes , lies , and coercion of HIM ASPECT_PARTY to get CONGRESS passed .
11355	2410	Meanwhile if bad ASPECT_ECONOMY_or ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT was mentioned , HIM was ready to write check .
11356	2410	, just throw money at problem until MONEY so buried in money no ASPECT_ONE can see MONEY anymore .
11357	2410	ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT , ASPECT_UP_4.144 ASPECT_TRILLION since Bush budget , how good is that doing for nation ?
11358	2410	Bush increased debt 4.350 ASPECT_TRILLION in 8 ASPECT_YEARS and you and liberals SCREAM horror of bush over .
11359	2410	Yet do n't even mutter about 4.144 ASPECT_TRILLION in just over 24 ASPECT_MONTHS .
11360	2410	Your ASPECT_CREDIBILITY with I is 4.144 ASPECT_TRILLION in arrears .
11361	2410	BP and ASPECT_OIL_SPILL ?
11362	2410	Now is Bush fault too ?
11363	2410	Utter , nonsense .
11364	2410	UTTER happened on incompetent ASPECT_OBAMALAMA watch and IF 4 ASPECT_FEET of oil -LRB- doubtful ASPECT_-RRB- is lying on floor of Gulf , it is obamalama job to see 4 cleaned up , not Bush .
11365	2410	ASPECT_OIL_SUBSIDIES ?
11366	2410	Do you know what they are ?
11367	2410	THEY are ASPECT_OIL_DEPLETION_ALLOWANCES because barrel THEY pump out of ground brings ASPECT_OIL_COMPANY barrel closer to going out of business .
11369	2410	Probably so , but THEY were not invented by Bush .
11370	2410	THEY were around when KID was drunken college ASPECT_KID and before .
11371	2410	Probably in effect when KID ASPECT_DAD was kid .
11372	2410	Before ASPECT_TAX_CHANGES in ASPECT_TAX_LAW in 80 I was invested in oil .
11373	2410	There were excellent ASPECT_LEGAL , ASPECT_TAX_CREDITS available for owning oil .
11374	2410	They took away and I and 10 of thousands of others , liberal and ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE , got out of oil .
11375	2410	Do I defend I opinions ?
11377	2410	Opinions found by experience greater than yours over decades .
11378	2410	-LRB- What you snidely think of as old ASPECT_AGE -RRB- Even as ASPECT_SCHOOL_AGE youngster I received better balanced ASPECT_EDUCATION than you poor ASPECT_KIDS do now with shambles schools have become .
11379	2410	I have risked I life 100 for country , knowingly put I life on line .
11380	2410	And I have willingly risked I ASPECT_LIFE_SAVINGS , cent I had .
11381	2410	You have done neither .
11382	2410	does not make I good ASPECT_PERSON and you not , PERSON could well be better ASPECT_PERSON than I .
11383	2410	But ASPECT_ALL-IN_RISKS are educational .
11384	2410	Educational about aspect of life .
11385	2410	Do I call I ASPECT_OPINIONS_FACTS ?
11386	2410	No , I do not .
11387	2410	I usually say is fact when NO is .
11388	2410	I do n't often point out that I 'm voicing opinion , but if has to be told , they would n't understand disclaimer anyway .
11389	2412	To stop ASPECT_DOWNWARD_SPIRAL country is currently engaged in .
11390	2413	And , what do you call post of yours , Kudos for BONE-HEAD ?
11391	2413	You ca n't defend Bratboy because BRATBOY was inept ASPECT_PRESIDENT country has seen in 50 ASPECT_YEARS .
11392	2413	Reagan was idiot , but even ASPECT_REAGAN raised taxes when REAGAN saw country going to hell in ASPECT_HAND_BASKET .
11393	2413	And , to proclaim that Bush is not responsible for ASPECT_HUMONGOUS_DEBT country has now ASPECT_IS trying to swim in now is simply ASPECT_ECONOMIC_BLASPHEMY .
11394	2413	Not so !!!!
11395	2413	ASPECT_READ_BONE-HEAD_POST again .
11396	2413	But , you wo n't .
11397	2413	On hand , BONE-HEAD ca n't see that Tea-baggers have leg to stand on for ridiculous and unrealistic ASPECT_DEMANDS .
11398	2413	`` Bone-head Boehner , in spite of ASPECT_BUBBA_YEARS in House , ca n't get ASPECT_PROCEDURE_RULES in ASPECT_HOUSE_CORRECT in order to forward ASPECT_BUBBA_AGENDA .
11399	2413	Bottom ASPECT_LINE , BUBBA is bogus ASPECT_EXCUSE for Speaker : BUBBA `` ASPECT_BLUBBERING_BUBBA at drop of hint of how BUBBA `` ASPECT_SUFFERED to get to where ASPECT_BUBBA is today .
11400	2413	You being ASPECT_FORMER_MILITARY_MAN , you must cringe at very ASPECT_SIGHT of ASPECT_MAN_shameful ASPECT_VISAGE of emotional ASPECT_DRAINAGE .
11401	2413	How far ASPECT_POLITICAL_LEADERS have deteriorated since ASPECT_VIET_NAM !
11402	2413	President in recent ASPECT_HISTORY to serve in combat was GHWB at ASPECT_AGE_19 .
11403	2413	Others wore uniform but did not serve in combat .
11404	2413	Perhaps 's why you feel compelled to brag about your ASPECT_SERVICE .
11405	2413	Yeah , PRESIDENT expected to fix in bit over 2 ASPECT_YEARS inept ASPECT_GOVERNANCE took Bratboy and ASPECT_NEOCONS_8 ASPECT_YEARS to mess up with lies and idiotic ASPECT_DECISIONS .
11406	2413	Even Rummy ASPECT_DUMMY , in ASPECT_PRESIDENT_NEW_BOOK , has ` fessed up to disaster ASPECT_OTHERS inflicted on we people !
11407	2413	Just your ASPECT_OPINION and others like you try to make ASPECT_CLAIM_STICK , but even if true , ASPECT_PRESIDENT helped states out of bind .
11408	2413	Ummmm , now who is making facts from opinion ?
11409	2413	Ca n't you get anything `` right ?
11410	2413	CA posted 4 -LRB- 's 4 ASPECT_INCHES -RRB- of oil on floor of gulf .
11411	2413	's report from source : Gulf of ASPECT_MEXICO_BOTTOM still coated in oil , recovery ASPECT_WAY off Is also `` ASPECT_BRAG that you got your ASPECT_MONEY_OUT ?
11412	2413	What has got to do with government continuing to pay corporate ASPECT_WELFARE to ASPECT_OIL_COMPANIES who are making astronomical ASPECT_PROFITS , profits higher that at time in history , while Republicans stridently scream about cutting education , Medicare\/Medicaid , ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , etc. .
11413	2413	What have conservatives got against young and old in country ?
11414	2413	Why do ASPECT_OIL_COMPANIES rate higher on scale of human ASPECT_NEED than human ASPECT_BEINGS ?
11415	2413	Again you presume info about BONE-HEAD that you do n't `` factually have access to .
11416	2413	You know little to about BONE-HEAD , ASPECT_BONE-HEAD_EDUCATION , ASPECT_BONE-HEAD_AGE , etc. .
11417	2413	ASPECT_BONE-HEAD_VENTURE to suggest that apolitical ASPECT_READER on forum who compares ASPECT_BONE-HEAD_POSTS to yours would come away with very different ASPECT_ASSESSMENT of ASPECT_BONE-HEAD_EDUCATION vs. yours , ASPECT_BONE-HEAD_ABILITY to reason vs. yours , ASPECT_BONE-HEAD_FOUNDATION of `` ASPECT_FACTS vs. your ASPECT_OPINIONATED based `` facts .
11418	2413	statement is `` ASPECT_HOOT !
11419	2414	Wow , you just noticed that when Obama became Prez ?
11420	2416	Check back with me when you learn to find truth on your and stop acting like ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_DUMMY .
11421	2416	Right now you do not have clue of what has really happened over 50 or 60 ASPECT_YEARS .
11422	2416	of which are pertinent to today situation .
11423	2416	What you dismiss as `` ASPECT_OLD is knowledge gained .
11424	2416	has n't happened for you yet .
11425	2416	way you keep your ASPECT_MIND locked shut , WAY may never happen for you .
11426	2417	Ehh it still feels like he is campaigning .
11427	2418	Obama has accelerated ASPECT_SPIRAL_EFFECT , and has taken ASPECT_SPENDING_and ASPECT_DEFICITS to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS .
11428	2418	OBAMA thinks that OBAMA can spend OBAMA ASPECT_WAY out of .
11429	2418	OBAMA screwing us , whether you admit WAY or not .
11430	2418	Your ASPECT_HERO is zero .
11431	2419	We did spend ASPECT_WE_WAY out of WAY .
11433	2420	And of ASPECT_COURSE_GEORGE_W._BUSH did none of .
11434	2420	BUSH savior .
11435	2420	angel !
11436	2420	ANGEL put country out of jeapordy with ANGEL ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for rich , ASPECT_WAR killed thousands of innocent ASPECT_PEOPLE , and ASPECT_KNEE_jerk ASPECT_RESPONSE to worst ASPECT_TERRORIST_ATTACK in history .
11437	2420	McCain would have continued heroic ASPECT_ACTS for country , with ASPECT_MCCAIN_GODSENT_angel ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN -LRB- did n't vote for her is SEXIST ! -RRB-
11438	2420	but people were STUPID and NAIVE ASPECT_ENOUGH to vote for ASPECT_KENYAN-BORN_OBAMA , just because HITLER BLACK .
11439	2420	And now socialist -LRB- socialism is UN-AMERICAN !!
11440	2420	poor ASPECT_PEOPLE should just SUFFER ! -RRB-
11441	2420	, Nazi , ASPECT_MUSLIM_sorry ASPECT_EXCUSE for President is putting country into ASPECT_DOWNWARD_SPIRAL !

11448	2420	I lie awake at ASPECT_NIGHT_WORRYING about NIGHT !!!! -RRB-
11449	2420	DO ASPECT_N'T_VOTE for Obama in 2012 .
11450	2420	OBAMA is HITLER !!
11451	2420	HITLER BIN ASPECT_LADEN !!!
11452	2420	DO ASPECT_N'T_VOTE FOR OBAMA ASPECT_UNLESS YOU WANT ASPECT_COUNTRY_DESTROYED !!!!
11453	2421	How does ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH being bad ASPECT_PRESIDENT make incompetent ASPECT_OBAMALAMA good ASPECT_PRESIDENT ?
11454	2421	One has to do with .
11455	2421	way they COULD be connected is that if Bush had been good ASPECT_PRESIDENT , then obama would not have been elected .
11456	2421	Another ASPECT_REPUBLICAN , Republican would have been .
11457	2421	If Bush had been good , Republicans would not have offered up ASPECT_SACRIFICIAL_LAMB , McCain .
11458	2421	THEY would have run else .
11459	2421	But Bush was bad , thus opening door for inexperienced far left radical ASPECT_IDIOT to become president .
11460	2421	So we went from doofus , to radical ASPECT_IDIOT .
11461	2421	is ASPECT_NOT_PROGRESS .
11462	2421	doofus added 4.350 ASPECT_TRILLION to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT in 8 ASPECT_YEARS and incompetent radical ASPECT_IDIOT WILL surpass amount when fiscal ASPECT_YEAR ends 09\/30\/2011 .
11463	2421	`` Bush caused recession !
11464	2421	is just ASPECT_STATEMENT made out of ignorance of facts and history .
11465	2421	BUSH did not cause ASPECT_STATEMENT_but ASPECT_BUSH was one of ASPECT_DECADES_LINE of contributors to ASPECT_EVENTUAL_COLLAPSE of economy .
11466	2421	obama did n't cause recession either .
11467	2421	But BUSH did TOTALLY ignore economy for well over year attempting `` by means necessary to get BUSH ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL passed .
11468	2421	Yet ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL does n't really start kicking in until 2014 .
11469	2421	economy was more important and SHOULD have been BUSH ASPECT_PRIORITY , NOT ASPECT_DREAM_WAY down road .
11470	2421	But in retrospect , ECONOMY good ASPECT_BUSH ignored economy , BUSH would have made even worse with BUSH ASPECT_BORROW and spend way out of debt ASPECT_APPROACH .
11471	2421	Bush ASPECT_SPENDING was terrible , obama is worse .
11472	2421	Bush used Patriot ASPECT_ACT , obama kept patriot ASPECT_ACT for ASPECT_OBAMA_USE .
11473	2421	Bush was vilified for war and ` ASPECT_SURGE . '
11474	2421	obama has kept ASPECT_WAR_GOING and did BUSH `` ASPECT_SURGE .
11475	2421	`` Bush was bad because of ` ASPECT_GITMO . '
11476	2421	obama has n't closed Gimot like ASPECT_GIMOT_PROMISED ASPECT_GIMOT would , in fact , GIMOT is quite happy to use GITMO .
11477	2421	Bush was killer for using attack ASPECT_DRONES .
11478	2421	obama uses TIMES death ASPECT_DRONES than Bush did .
11479	2421	So YES !
11480	2421	Bush was bad .
11481	2421	How does make ASPECT_OBAMA_GOOD ?
11482	2423	And if there were no ASPECT_MESS , obama would n't be president .
11483	2423	I did say was connection .
11484	2423	Regardless bush was bad .
11485	2423	does not make ASPECT_OBAMA_GOOD .
11486	2423	He 's much worse .
11487	2423	You do n't want to believe but ASPECT_HISTORY will list HE as worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT in modern ASPECT_TIMES , maybe ever .
11488	2423	No ASPECT_ONE can say nation is not in ASPECT_DEEP_financial ASPECT_TROUBLE .
11489	2423	No ASPECT_MATTER if you love or hate obama , we are in trouble .
11490	2423	And ONE does n't matter who you want to blame , problem STILL has to be fixed .
11491	2423	Blaming is gross ASPECT_WASTE of time .
11492	2423	So what does incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA do about ASPECT_WE_serious financial ASPECT_PROBLEMS ?
11493	2423	In OBAMALAMA accomplished oratory , OBAMALAMA eliminates ASPECT_WORD_SPEND , and replaces ASPECT_WORD_WITH , `` invest .
11494	2423	Once again insulting ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC with ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_unbridled arrogance and ASPECT_CONCEIT .
11495	2424	Wow , pay attention to sarcastic ASPECT_POST .
11496	2424	Everyone always seems to blame Obama for ASPECT_SINGLE_PROBLEM in country .
11497	2424	problems were there in Bush and even ASPECT_CLINTON_YEARS , yet no ASPECT_ONE blamed them for problems .
11498	2424	Now that we have black ASPECT_PERSON as President , suddenly right-wings are noticing `` hey , wrong with country .
11499	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID NOW !
11500	2424	and 's THEM 've been saying since Obama was sworn in .
11501	2424	`` Deficit ?
11502	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID NOW !
11504	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID NOW !
11505	2424	ASPECT_HIGH_TAXES ?
11506	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID NOW !
11507	2424	flaw in U.S. ?
11508	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID !
11509	2424	`` 's what post was making fun of .
11510	2425	We certainly did not .
11511	2426	To contrary .
11512	2426	economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 ASPECT_JOBS month and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET was tanking and unemployment ASPECT_RATE was skyrocketing before stimulus passed .
11513	2426	Not economy has been growing for year and half , jobs are being created , ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET is up about ASPECT_85 , and unemployment ASPECT_RATE is ASPECT_DECLINING.BI-PARTISAN_ORGANIZATIONS like ASPECT_CBO_ESTIMATE stimulus saved or created up to over 3 million ASPECT_JOBS and decreased unemployment ASPECT_RATE by 1.8 ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_POINTS .
11514	2427	You have just ranted for paragraph about things that I never mentioned .
11515	2427	Quit living in past .
11516	2427	Obama is screwing us , and you are too blindsided to see LIVING .
11517	2428	OK , you keep believing that if it makes you feel better .
11519	2429	Look up `` ASPECT_SARCASM in ASPECT_DICTIONARY_.2 .
11520	2429	Reread my ASPECT_POST_.3 .
11521	2429	Reread your ASPECT_POST_.4 .
11522	2429	Take look at history .
11523	2429	problems you blame ASPECT_OBAMA_FOR were there for ASPECT_HECKUVA_TIME .
11524	2429	You just did n't see HECKUVA until `` ASPECT_KENYAN_socialist ASPECT_MUSLIM_NAZI_PIECE of poo you call president took office .
11525	2429	Because while Bush was president , you wanted to keep living in your ASPECT_FAIRYTALE_WORLD and believe was wrong with country , just because ASPECT_WHITE_REPUBLICAN was in office .
11526	2429	YOURSELF kept lying to yourself and everyone around you .
11527	2430	OK , you keep believing that if FACT makes you feel better .
11528	2430	FACT 's not question of belief as to changes in economy nor as to estimates of ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_CBO .
11529	2430	FACT is well documented fact .
11530	2431	ASPECT_ULTIMATE_liberal ASPECT_STANDARD , `` PLAY ASPECT_RACE_CARD AT ASPECT_OPPORTUNITY .
11531	2431	No wonder ASPECT_LIBERALS are so happy , LIBERALS get to play ASPECT_RACE_CARD 3 or 4 ASPECT_TIMES hour with clown in office .
11532	2432	Did my ASPECT_POST say that obama did not cause recession ?
11533	2432	Did POST say that or did POST not say that ?
11535	2432	Bush ran up ASPECT_HUGE_DEFICITS and added 4.350 ASPECT_TRILLION to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT .
11536	2432	And liberal ASPECT_PRESS crucified BUSH for PRESS .
11537	2432	And so did FOX !
11538	2432	4.350 ASPECT_TRILLION over 8 ASPECT_YEARS is just over ASPECT_HALF_TRILLION per year .
11539	2432	AND IS TERRIBLE .
11540	2432	Yet liberal ASPECT_PRESS thinks that even though obama has run deficits surpassing Bush ASPECT_DEFICITS_and ASPECT_OBAMA is increasing ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT than 2 trillion ASPECT_PER_YEAR , is OK because BUSH black , or for change , or is good because Bush was bad .
11541	2432	MY 'll say ASPECT_PRESS_SLOW for you .
11542	2432	BUSH , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , bad , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ASPECT_OBAMA_, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ASPECT_WORSE .
11543	2433	I 'll say it slow for you .
11544	2433	... .
11545	2433	problems ... .
11547	2433	with ... ... .
11549	2433	... are ... .
11550	2433	not ... .
11551	2433	Obama ... .
11554	2434	Perhaps English is not your ASPECT_NATIVE_LANGUAGE .
11555	2434	I clearly said that obama was not at fault for recession .
11556	2434	However he IS at fault for incredible , unending , ASPECT_LIST of mistakes HE has made .
11557	2434	HE did not cause problem as Bush did not cause problem either .
11558	2434	But Bush made PROBLEM ASPECT_WORSE and incompetent idiot ASPECT_OBAMALAMA has trumped Bush and made bad ASPECT_SITUATION even worse .
11559	2434	Just ASPECT_MONEY alone .
11560	2434	Bush spending , liberal ASPECT_MEDIA screamed about Bush spending .
11561	2434	FOX screamed about BUSH ASPECT_SPENDING .
11562	2434	I screamed about BUSH ASPECT_SPENDING .
11563	2434	Did YOU ?
11564	2434	Now I scream about obama spending .
11565	2434	FOX ASPECT_SCREAMS about obama spending .
11566	2434	liberal ASPECT_MEDIA does n't scream about OBAMA ASPECT_SPENDING .
11567	2434	Do YOU ?
11568	2434	Yet by 09\/30\/2011 , 7 ASPECT_MONTHS from now , obamalama will have increased ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT by dollars than Bush did in 8 ASPECT_YEARS .
11569	2434	But I 'm sure you 'll pee in your ASPECT_DIAPERS and say `` YOU had to spend like insane ASPECT_IDIOT .
11570	2434	Well reckless ASPECT_SPENDING_POLITICIAN says that .
11571	2434	And for obamalama and politician MONTHS pure unadulterated ASPECT_BULLSH !
11572	2434	t. is just ASPECT_ONE , but THING one can ruin nation .
11573	2434	There is ASPECT_LAUNDRY_LIST of -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_-LRB- -RRB- ups clown has done .
11574	2434	How about cop and prof in Mass. .
11575	2434	RACISM on president part .
11576	2434	woman from Dept of Agriculture .
11577	2434	DEPT had WOMAN fired before knowing fact .
11578	2434	ASPECT_REVERSE_RACISM on ASPECT_PRESIDENTS_PART .
11579	2434	Then had MSNBC and ASPECT_NY_TIMES try to blame MSNBC on FOX .
11580	2434	How about ignoring Constitution AND ASPECT_STANDING_bankruptcy ASPECT_LAWS and cheating rightful ASPECT_CREDITORS and giving GM away to UAW .
11581	2434	Or ASPECT_CURRENT_EVENTS , sticking his uninformed and biased ASPECT_NOSE into affairs of WI , after being afraid to say anything to ASPECT_EGYPT_AND ASPECT_IRAN .
11582	2434	Or ASPECT_IRANIAN_WARSHIPS now in Mediterranean .
11583	2434	You can hate Bush but ASPECT_IRAN knew if CREDITORS tried that under Bush , ASPECT_CREDITORS_WARSHIPS would soon be artificial ASPECT_REEFS .
11584	2434	But because obama is weakling , CREDITORS thumbed ASPECT_CREDITORS_NOSE at USA .
11585	2434	And 's not 10th of 10TH ASPECT_SCREW ups .
11586	2434	10TH is ASPECT_EMPTY_SUIT filled with clever ASPECT_RECORDINGS , but 's evidently enough to fool you .
11587	2435	Obama is not anti-Christ .
11588	2435	Bush is not God .
11589	2435	Open your ASPECT_EYES for time , my ASPECT_BABY , and see world .
11590	2436	US can not have debate with foolish ASPECT_NO_CHILD is indoctrinated into liberal ASPECT_LIES .
11591	2436	But FOX did scream about Bush spending .
11592	2436	You were being potty trained and missed SPENDING .
11593	2436	US screamed about Bush spending , then and now .
11594	2436	Evidently you can not read well enough see now ASPECT_PART and you do n't know anything about then ASPECT_PART .
11595	2436	See little ASPECT_GIRL , US retired about time Bush became president , but you feel free to call US liar .
11596	2436	-LCB- ASPECT_MOD_EDIT : ASPECT_PERSONAL_INSULTS are against ASPECT_TOS_-RCB- .
11597	2436	Never have you seen US even hint connection between incompetent ASPECT_FOOL -LRB- no ASPECT_WONDER you like FOOL -RRB- ASPECT_OBAMA and Hitler .
11598	2436	Palin was ASPECT_THROWAWAY_SACRIFICIAL_LAMB to fill out ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_TICKET they knew THEY were going to lose .
11599	2436	THEY just thought THEY were going to lose to Hillary , not ASPECT_CLOWN_PRINCE of .
11600	2436	Palin is and continues to be is distraction .
11601	2436	ASPECT_HILLARY_CELEBRITY is 100 fault of ASPECT_LEFT_WING_PRESS .
11602	2436	Had THEY ignored ASPECT_HILLARY_HILLARY would be footnote in history now .
11603	2436	spending ?
11604	2436	ASPECT_GOOGLE_or ASPECT_BING ASPECT_OFFICIAL_US_TREASURY of ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT .
11605	2436	At end of Bush fiscal ASPECT_YEAR_END was 10.024 ASPECT_TRILLION , increase of 4.350 ASPECT_TRILLION over Clinton .
11607	2436	At end of Clinton fiscal ASPECT_YEAR debt was 5.674 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11608	2436	You could look END up instead of immaturely ASPECT_CALLING liar when YOU are 100 ASPECT_WRONG .
11609	2436	And as of TODAY ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is at 14.175 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11610	2436	In case you are remedial at ASPECT_MATH_and ASPECT_READING , is increase of 4.151 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11611	2436	So 199 ASPECT_BILLION and LIAR passes Bush .
11612	2436	And 849 ASPECT_BILLION to pass 5 trillion ASPECT_MARK , year .
11613	2436	And is 7 ASPECT_MONTHS from now -LRB- US fiscal ASPECT_YEAR ends 09\/30 year -RRB- .
11614	2436	LIAR is lock to pass Bush , question is how far past 5 trillion ASPECT_MARK_LIAR will push ASPECT_NATIONAL_debt ASPECT_YEAR .
11615	2436	You might also check Congressional Budget ASPECT_OFFICE -LRB- CBO -RRB- ASPECT_OFFICIAL_ESTIMATE of projected ASPECT_DEBT from obama spending .
11616	2436	OFFICE shocking , and 's CBO .
11617	2436	ONES are ASPECT_ONES_OFFICIAL_ESTIMATORS for Government .
11618	2436	ONES are ones said obamalamacare would be deficit neutral and even might save about 200 ASPECT_BILLION .
11619	2436	ONES 've since backed away from nonsense .
11620	2436	NONSENSE took crazy , wasteful , reckless ASPECT_SPENDING Bush 8 ASPECT_YEARS to increase debt that .
11621	2436	ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMA is spending at rate much more than twice ASPECT_BUSH .
11622	2436	And if you claim is not true .
11623	2436	-LCB- ASPECT_MOD_EDIT : ASPECT_PERSONAL_INSULTS are against ASPECT_TOS_-RCB- .
11624	2438	Well , I have `` ASPECT_BIT of sense and ASPECT_BLUE_RIBBON_EDUCATION to boot and what you imply borders on stuff espoused by conspiracy ASPECT_THEORISTS like ASPECT_JOHN_BIRCH_SOCIETY .
11625	2438	people hate everybody ; and according to PEOPLE , who disagrees with PEOPLE are `` ASPECT_BRAINWASHED_LIBERALS .
11626	2438	Well , investigate ASPECT_PEOPLE_RHETORIC and one soon discovers that just about ASPECT_WORD_PEOPLE_UTTER is without foundation -- ASPECT_PAST_and ASPECT_PRESENT .
11627	2438	I 've been invited to ASPECT_PEOPLE_MEETINGS and went .
11628	2438	ASPECT_PEOPLE_APPEAL to everyone who has grudge and GRUDGE always `` ASPECT_LIBERALS who are to blame -- you name GRUDGE , PEOPLE 're responsible .
11629	2438	At one ASPECT_TIME , TIME was `` ASPECT_COMMIES and `` fellow-travellers , now NOW `` ASPECT_LIBERALS .
11630	2438	ASPECT_YOUNG_PEOPLE are liberal because PEOPLE react to ASPECT_OVERT_and covert unfairness and injustice ASPECT_PEOPLE see in ASPECT_PEOPLE_COUNTRY , coming from so-called `` ASPECT_ADULTS .
11631	2438	includes often ideas and behavior ASPECT_PEOPLE observe coming from ASPECT_PEOPLE_PARENTS .
11632	2438	PEOPLE are brainwashed by media -LRB- from kindergarden to ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL and beyond -RRB- that USA is greatest ASPECT_COUNTRY in world because citizens are `` free to think , feel , see opportunity and be successful just by following `` rules , and by working hard .
11633	2438	Well , NONE of is true .
11634	2438	TALE ASPECT_FAIRY_TALE , just like Santa ASPECT_CLAUS and ASPECT_EASTER_BUNNY .
11635	2438	By ASPECT_AGE_11 or ASPECT_12 , kids see hypocrisy .
11636	2438	What ASPECT_KIDS do then is try to affect change to reflect `` ASPECT_DREAM to help make dream come true .
11637	2438	-LRB- 's what is going on in ASPECT_ME_RIGHT now ! -RRB-
11638	2438	What hell does statement mean ?
11639	2438	STATEMENT does n't make sense !
11640	2438	No ASPECT_ONE who has seen photos of holocaust could make statement .
11641	2438	ONE so totally `` off ASPECT_LINE .
11642	2438	Your ASPECT_FORUM_NAME is certainly apropos because `` ASPECT_ANARCHIST -LRB- meaning `` outlaw -RRB- could stomach kind of political .
11643	2438	statement describes ASPECT_BRATBOY_BUSH to `` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , than to Obama .
11644	2438	How could Obama with just ASPECT_BIT over 2 ASPECT_YEARS in office have made record like one you opine ?
11645	2438	As for your `` ASPECT_BOY ASPECT_TERRY_LAKIN , BOY suggest ASPECT_LAKIN_WEB_SITE is more strong ASPECT_PLEA for contributions than for `` truth .
11646	2438	source you post here is , without question , HARD HARD RIGHT ASPECT_WING_NUTS !
11647	2438	No ASPECT_ONE with even ASPECT_OUNCE of `` ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE would accept `` Junk ASPECT_RHETORIC as anything more than `` Junk ASPECT_FOOD fried up for mentally challenged ASPECT_IDEOLOGUES .
11648	2438	You have nerve complaining about Obama when you offer up cholesterol jammed greasy ASPECT_SNAKE_OIL to !
11649	2439	If is `` ASPECT_ASS here , it is one who ca n't handle truth !
11650	2439	And , you , DanNO have struggle with ASPECT_SIMPLE_TRUTH that others point out to you .
11652	2439	She 's referred to SHE as `` Mama ASPECT_GRIZZLY and ASPECT_PIT_bull wearing ASPECT_LIPSTICK , but `` ASPECT_SACRIFICIAL_LAMB is not in ASPECT_SHE_VOCABULARY .
11655	2439	Naughty , ASPECT_NAUGHTY .
11656	2439	Must ` ASPECT_NT_CALL_PEOPLE_NAMES because NAUGHTY is n't polite on forum .
11657	2439	Tho ' ASPECT_ECONOMIST know of one allows things and even `` dirty ASPECT_WORDS than you can think to spout .
11658	2439	Look , DanNO40 , ECONOMIST can agree with you about spending .
11659	2439	ECONOMIST have been called `` ASPECT_CHEAP for ASPECT_ECONOMIST_ADHERENCE to fiscal ASPECT_RESPONSIBILITY .
11660	2439	ECONOMIST say ECONOMIST am `` frugal and let ADHERENCE go at .
11661	2439	ECONOMIST consider ECONOMIST very responsible `` saver and `` ASPECT_INVESTOR -LRB- For example , ECONOMIST bought Apple when ADHERENCE was 14 share .
11662	2439	ASPECT_ECONOMIST_pat ASPECT_ECONOMIST on back day for bit of insight . -RRB-
11663	2439	ECONOMIST am NOT economist .
11664	2439	ASPECT_ECONOMISTS_ECONOMIST have had experience with are `` ASPECT_AIR_HEADS , meaning ECONOMISTS are ASPECT_THEORY_and not ASPECT_REALISTS .
11665	2439	So much for likes of Bernanke , Greenspan , ASPECT_VOLKER_ET .
11667	2439	-LRB- Tho ' ASPECT_ECONOMIST was gratified that Greenspan finally ` fessed up about LIBERTARIAN idol ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN , ASPECT_AYN_RAND , had got THO wrong ASPECT_-RRB- .
11668	2439	But , ECONOMIST also think that success in business does not guarantee that person is qualified to govern country .
11669	2439	Too very different ASPECT_JOBS .
11670	2439	CEO job is to make good ASPECT_PROFIT .
11671	2439	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_or ASPECT_LEADER of country must provide for `` people best ASPECT_INTEREST , way of ASPECT_LIFE_and ASPECT_PROTECTION of life .
11672	2439	Very different ASPECT_OBLIGATIONS .
11673	2439	IOW , CEO obligation is to make money for shareholders .
11674	2439	President obligation is to promote people welfare from birth to death .
11675	2439	ECONOMIST think Obama has tried to do .
11676	2439	Further , ECONOMIST do n't expect OBAMA to be `` perfect particularly in light of ASPECT_OBAMA_PREDECESSOR inept ASPECT_PERFORMANCE .
11677	2439	ECONOMIST 've said before ECONOMIST am Independent -- and ECONOMIST am .
11678	2439	ECONOMIST happen to know and respect one very able and competent ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_SENATOR , ASPECT_RICHARD_LUGAR .
11679	2439	ECONOMIST also know and respect another very able and competent ASPECT_TIME ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_SENATOR , ASPECT_CARL_LEVIN .
11680	2439	Both , are brilliant and above , politically reasonable and ASPECT_RESPONSIBLE .
11681	2439	ASPECT_ECONOMIST_PERSONAL_RECOLLECTION of two well behaved ASPECT_POLITICIANS is that POLITICIANS are rubbing POLITICIANS collective ASPECT_HEADS in dismay at what is going on in ASPECT_WASHINGTON_TODAY .
11682	2439	ECONOMIST feel bad for what POLITICIANS must cope with in today ASPECT_POLITICAL_CLIMATE .
11683	2439	As ASPECT_DAVID_LETTERMAN would say , `` LETTERMAN would n't wish that on ASPECT_MONKEY_SITTIN ' on rock .
11684	2440	Your ASPECT_WORDS about economists are reasonably intelligent ASPECT_POSTS you have made .
11685	2440	There are couple of know clowns on another ASPECT_THREAD tried to say that I did n't know anything about business because I would n't hire economists .
11686	2440	Even after I pointed out to ASPECT_ECONOMISTS that economists make up less than ASPECT_3\/10THOUDANDTHS of ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_WORKFORCE .
11687	2440	I disagree that president job is to promote people ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE from birth to death .
11688	2440	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_JOB is to take care of nation so that people can promote ASPECT_PEOPLE_WELFARE .
11689	2440	You may think is , I believe otherwise .
11690	2440	Providing atmosphere where both and small , ASPECT_UNION_and ASPECT_NON-UNION_COMPANIES could hire again would allow PEOPLE to provide for PEOPLE .
11691	2440	Instead PRESIDENT has pursued ASPECT_LEFTIST_AGENDA , providing welfare rather than promoting anything but ASPECT_PRESIDENT_AGENDA .
11692	2440	And spending , that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_SHOWS no ASPECT_SIGN of even truly ASPECT_ACKNOWLEDGING , is knife in heart of nation .
11693	2440	And ASPECT_PRESIDENT_PREDECESSORS_INEPTNESS , is given .
11694	2440	Now how does that make obamalama anything more or less than PRESIDENT is ?
11695	2440	Bush was inept , obamalama is more so .
11696	2440	I 'd greatly prefer was not case .
11697	2440	I 'd prefer that we had capable Chief ASPECT_EXECUTIVE , but having been CEO and having interviewed and hired executives .
11698	2440	I would not hire BHO for anything above ASPECT_MIDDLE_LEVEL_SALES .
11699	2440	And I 'd have ASPECT_BHO_IMMEDIATE_SUPERVISOR_WATCH_BHO very closely since I never allowed salesman to sell on anything but quality and ASPECT_SERVICE .
11700	2440	And I 'd be very wary of BHO overselling with loads of BS .
11701	2440	And what ASPECT_LETTERMAN says is unimportant .
11702	2440	I do n't know why LETTERMAN sold out ASPECT_LETTERMAN_TALENT to liberal ASPECT_LEFT , but LETTERMAN did .
11703	2440	ASPECT_AYN_RAND was Russian .
11704	2440	likely had experiences that neither her ASPECT_FANS nor ASPECT_HER_DISTRACTORS ever will have .
11705	2440	HER was excellent ASPECT_AUTHOR .
11706	2440	I 've enjoyed many if not of her ASPECT_BOOKS .
11707	2440	FANS are fiction .
11708	2440	No different than movies , make believe .
11709	2441	of your ASPECT_CREDIT just went out window .
11710	2441	of it .
11711	2441	Do you even understand ASPECT_THINGS_REGAN did for country ?
11712	2441	Of course you do n't .
11713	2441	In fact , you probably were n't even alive during ASPECT_REGAN_PRESIDENCY .
11714	2441	Please refrain from polluting beautiful ASPECT_BLOG_NETWORK with completely inane ASPECT_CLAIMS such as .
11716	2443	Do n't try to blame MEMBER for your ASPECT_POSTS !
11717	2443	There is your inexperience and ASPECT_NAIVETY showing through .
11718	2443	Can you say ASPECT_CARTER_or ASPECT_NIXON ?
11719	2443	And there is ASPECT_READING_CHALLENGE rearing INEXPERIENCE ugly ASPECT_HEAD .
11720	2443	ASPECT_MEMBER_CLEARLY said Bush increased debt by 4.350 ASPECT_TRILLION in 8 ASPECT_YEARS , and to do so was terrible .
11721	2443	But you want to make excuses for obamalama increasing debt by 4.151 ASPECT_TRILLION in just over ASPECT_1\/4TH of time .
11722	2443	Where is logic or ASPECT_INTELLIGENCE in ?
11723	2443	obamalama will surpass Bush awful ASPECT_SPENDING in just ASPECT_WEEKS , and OBAMALAMA will have increased debt by than 5 ASPECT_TRILLION by end of fiscal ASPECT_YEAR_9\/30\/2011 .
11725	2443	MEMBER mention ASPECT_MEMBER_SERVICE only as example of one of ASPECT_LEARNING_EXPERIENCES you have not had and can not imagine .
11726	2443	of which help develop very accurate ASPECT_BULLSH !
11727	2443	detector , which incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA sets off on ASPECT_ONGOING_BASIS .
11728	2443	ASPECT_SHOW_MEMBER where MEMBER said BHO is bad for not fixing economy in time BHO had .
11729	2443	ASPECT_MEMBER_COMPLAINT is that ASPECT_BHO_SINGULAR_APPROACH , pour money over APPROACH , has not worked and that BHO spent than half ASPECT_BHO_PRESIDENCY ramrodding bad ASPECT_BILL even ASPECT_BHO_PARTY had to be bribed and threatened to pass .
11730	2443	There was and is crushing ASPECT_PRIORITY in ASPECT_COUNTRY_and ASPECT_PRIORITY is ASPECT_NOT_HEALTH_CARE .
11731	2443	But BHO had to ignore economy while BHO had control of both ASPECT_HOUSES of Congress .
11732	2443	Understandable , but complete ASPECT_FAILURE of judgment .
11733	2443	Even ASPECT_OBAMALAMA hisownself has admitted that `` shovel ready ASPECT_PROJECTS were myth .
11734	2443	's not good enough for you ?
11735	2443	When POTUS admits POTUS , MEMBER 'm still voicing opinion ?
11736	2443	's amazing .
11737	2443	Plus , HISOWNSELF had NO ASPECT_BUSINESS bailing out state without consent of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE .
11738	2443	But HISOWNSELF did bail out states , Democrat ASPECT_STATES primarily , with `` bait and ASPECT_SWITCH_STIMULUS_BILL .
11739	2443	BAIT WAS supposed to create jobs .
11740	2443	Covering states past due bad ASPECT_DEBTS is not creating jobs .
11741	2443	And MEMBER guess we are even , you do n't ` remember ' that Nixon was bad ASPECT_PRESIDENT .
11742	2443	And MEMBER do n't remember that Kissinger was ever president .
11743	2443	horse and horse .
11744	2443	Your `` ASPECT_SOURCE is `` Gone with Wind .
11745	2443	And you would lose venture .
11746	2443	Your ASPECT_POSTS reveal about you .
11747	2443	IDEOLOGUE are closed ASPECT_MINDED_IDEOLOGUE is n't ever aware that LIBERAL are far ASPECT_LEFT_LIBERAL .
11748	2443	You choose to ignore facts when you find them inconvenient , and little ASPECT_OR you say is from your ASPECT_INTELLECT .
11749	2443	Now if you wish to claim that MEMBER am also closed ASPECT_MINDED_IDEOLOGUE , MEMBER will admit has merit .
11750	2443	But at one ASPECT_TIME_MEMBER was member of union , than ASPECT_ONE , and ASPECT_REGISTERED_DEMOCRAT .
11751	2443	MEMBER gave up long before FOX went on air .
11752	2443	MEMBER gave up on ASPECT_LIBERALS_and ASPECT_DEMOCRATS after observing what LIBERALS do and results of what DO do .
11753	2444	Palin is ass who celebrity is totally fault of ASPECT_LEFT_WING_MEDIA attempting to outdo by mocking her .
11754	2444	Had ASPECT_LEFTIST_MEDIA just ignored HER after election , HER 'd be footnote now .
11755	2444	But what does Palin being genius or dolt have to do with obama ?
11756	2444	If Palin was terrific , would n't make ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_BAD .
11757	2444	PALIN does to PALIN .
11758	2444	And Palin being ass does n't make ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA_GOOD either .
11759	2444	One has to do with .
11760	2444	ONE liberal ASPECT_LOONY-ISM to attach ASPECT_CAUSE_and ASPECT_EFFECT to connection between them
11761	2445	Sorry I neglected to add in I earlier ASPECT_POST .
11762	2445	numbers are NOT I opinion .
11763	2445	However we can safely say that statements like : ASPECT_OIL_COMPANIES who are making astronomical ASPECT_PROFITS , profits higher that at time in history , are strictly your ASPECT_OPINION .
11764	2445	gross incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN 2 big `` ASPECT_INDUSTRIES of Evil .

11769	2445	When in reality , VILLAINS are just easy ASPECT_TARGETS for VECH-5 to lie about to ignorant .
11770	2449	Yes race will be close because he is superb at campaigning to be president .
11771	2449	HE is so good at ASPECT_RACE_HE has never stopped campaigning to be president .
11772	2449	RACE shame that HE is so bad at being president .
11773	2450	You have mistaken me for Bush ASPECT_FAN .
11774	2450	ME voted for FAN , but realized that FAN had problems of FAN .
11775	2450	ME could n't wait for FAN to be out of office by end of ASPECT_FAN_second ASPECT_TERM .
11776	2450	Obama is accelerating decline of country .
11777	2450	slowing ASPECT_OBAMA_DOWN , is Republican controlled House .
11778	2450	Luckily , OBAMA could n't even get that OBAMA wanted passed when Dems controlled everything .
11779	2450	Now who 's in ASPECT_FAIRYTALE_LAND and lying to everyone around them ?
11781	2451	I have seen is ASPECT_EVER-INCREASING_BUREAUCRACY in Washington .
11782	2451	ASPECT_PUBLIC_SECTOR , unfortunately , is where growth is .
11783	2451	economy is stagnating , jobs are not being created like you think , and unemployment ASPECT_RATE is still dismal .
11784	2451	I have serious ASPECT_DOUBTS as to whether or ASPECT_NOT stimulus did anything except to increase deficits .
11785	2452	You seem to be ignoring facts .
11786	2452	After Bush wrecked ASPECT_ECONOMY_REVENUE drastically increased , and Obama has also needed to spend lot to stimulate wrecked ASPECT_ECONOMY , so ASPECT_DIRECT_COMPARISIONS to Bush are intellectually dishonest .
11787	2452	Bush had no ASPECT_EXCUSE for what BUSH did .
11788	2452	ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for rich and 2 ASPECT_UNNECCESSARY_WARS are what blew up deficit .
11789	2453	republicans are slowing him down ?
11791	2453	Which ASPECT_PARTY held unemployment benefits ASPECT_HOSTAGE so bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS could be extended and blew another 800 billion ASPECT_HOLE in deficit ?
11793	2453	REPUBLICANS are ones trying to destroy country , which REPUBLICANS did for 8 ASPECT_YEARS but now REPUBLICANS really want to finish NOW off because ASPECT_OBAMA_FAILURE , is way to fool sheep into voting REPUBLICANS back into power .
11794	2453	Which ASPECT_PARTY ensured financial reform ASPECT_BILL was as weak as -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- and ineffective ?
11795	2453	Again republicans , and result will be another ASPECT_CRASH .
11796	2454	Whine out ASPECT_OBAMALAMA excuses you wish , but as bad as Bush was , incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA is worse .
11797	2454	WORSE .
11798	2454	Comparing Bush and clown is comparing dumb and ASPECT_DUMBERER .
11799	2454	seeds of destruction of economy were planted long before Bush showed up .
11800	2454	Bush was ineffective in stopping seeds from sprouting .
11801	2454	And ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA is even worse at correcting economy .
11802	2454	But is not ASPECT_DID_FAULT .
11803	2454	DID is politician and it is politicians that caused to economy to be set up to collapse over decades .
11804	2454	So while NOT fixing economy is not obamalama fault .
11805	2454	Running up ASPECT_ENORMOUS_DEBT in process IS ASPECT_DID_FAULT .
11806	2454	THERE is no arguing or ASPECT_EXCUSING debt ASPECT_NUMBERS .
11807	2454	Bush increased debt by 4.350 ASPECT_TRILLION over 8 ASPECT_YEARS .
11808	2454	2 ASPECT_YEARS and highest ASPECT_INCREASES were under Democrat ASPECT_CONTROL -LRB- including rookie , JUNIOR ASPECT_SENATOR_OBAMA -RRB- But Bush ASPECT_DID_SIGN increases .
11809	2454	And since end of Bush ASPECT_FULL_fiscal ASPECT_YEAR , debt has increased by another 4.2 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11810	2454	So in SHORT ASPECT_TIME incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN_fool ASPECT_OBAMALAMA , has increased debt by nearly as as ASPECT_BUSH did in 8 ASPECT_YEARS .
11811	2454	And for kicker ASPECT_CLOWN_FOOL has just submitted budget ASPECT_KICKER_LIES and says BUDGET will reduce deficits by 400 .
11812	2454	billion while debt will increase by 7 ASPECT_TRILLION .
11813	2454	We can file fool ASPECT_OBAMALAMA under heading , `` Be Careful What You ASPECT_WISH For !
11814	2455	economy is not stagnating , ECONOMY growing .
11815	2455	About 3 ASPECT_YEAR .
11816	2455	big ASPECT_IMPROVEMENT over ASPECT_-7_DECLINE in ASPECT_EARLY_2009 .
11817	2455	You may have serious ASPECT_DOUBTS , but ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DATA showing turnaround in economy and fact that CBO has calculated ASPECT_STIMULUS_saved or created ASPECT_MILLIONS of jobs is not matter of belief , but matter of record .
11818	2455	You can find data on ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH at : ASPECT_BEA .
11819	2455	govYou can find data on unemployment at : http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/webapps\/legacy\/cpsatab1.htmYou can see ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET_PERFORMANCE here : http:\/\/www.google.com\/finance?client...DEXDJX:grin:JIYou can see ASPECT_CBO_REPORTS on stimulus here : http:\/\/www.cbo.gov\/publications\/coll...cfm?collect=12
11820	2456	So your actually ASPECT_DENYING that in recession , ASPECT_GOVERMENT_REVENUE drops drastically ?
11821	2456	, and in recession it is vital for goverment to spend to stimulate economy ?
11822	2456	You are disagreement with ASPECT_BASIC_ECONOMIC_FUNDAMENTALS im afraid .
11823	2457	Bush inherited budget ASPECT_SURPLUS and squandered ASPECT_SURPLUS , running up 5 trillion ASPECT_DEBT .
11824	2457	Obama inherited great recession ASPECT_AND of debt OBAMA has incurred is because of .
11825	2457	Whether OBAMA can preside over meaningful deficit ASPECT_REDUCTION with House in control of Republicans who refuse to consider increasing ASPECT_REVENUES will remain to be seen .
11826	2457	But I have always been critical of Obama relatively lax attitude toward budget -LRB- though OBAMA was president in decades to actually reduce spending year -RRB- .
11827	2457	It was reason I supported Clinton .
11828	2457	Unfortunately , McCain gave no reasonable ASPECT_ALTERNATIVE .
11829	2458	To which of 50 or so `` ASPECT_BASIC_ECONOMIC_FUNDAMENTALS do you refer ?
11830	2458	Not 50 ASPECT_MATTERS since one is `` theoretical .
11831	2458	`` Prior to ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DOWNTURN , one where YOU spent ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_MONEY , took from 1929 until 1946 and World ASPECT_WAR to correct .
11832	2458	times ASPECT_GOVERNMENT has lowered taxes and got out of way of ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR to allow economy to recover on WAY , and WAY has .
11833	2458	And here is `` ASPECT_BASIC_ECONOMIC_TRUTH for you .
11834	2458	ASPECT_PRESENT_RECESSION is 100 fault of ASPECT_TERM_MEDDLING in business by politicians of both ASPECT_PARTIES .
11835	2458	Politicians , no ASPECT_MATTER what ASPECT_LABEL_POLITICIANS attach to POLITICIANS caused ASPECT_HOUSING_, financial and ASPECT_SECURITIES_TROUBLES with ASPECT_LAWS_POLITICIANS have passed and ASPECT_LAWS_POLITICIANS repealed .
11836	2458	To look to politicians to correct problem that POLITICIANS ignore POLITICIANS created is height , or depth , of folly .
11837	2459	Just out today for you : US ASPECT_MANUFACTURING_ACTIVITY hits 2004 ASPECT_HIGHWASHINGTON_&#8212; US manufacturing grew for ASPECT_19TH_STRAIGHT_MONTH in February as jump in ASPECT_EMPLOYMENT_and ASPECT_PRODUCTION drove activity to nearly ASPECT_SIX-YEAR_HIGH , ASPECT_INDUSTRY_SURVEY showed Tuesday .
11838	2459	Employment also rose 2.8 ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_POINTS , to 64.5 ASPECT_PERCENT , climbing above 60 ASPECT_PERCENT `` for ASPECT_THIRD_TIME in decade , Ore said .
11839	2459	http:\/\/www.google.com\/hostednews\/afp...01ac4be9a7.45119 ASPECT_MONTHS ago MONTHS was ASPECT_JULY_2009 , about 3-4 ASPECT_MONTHS after stimulus passed .
11840	2459	ASPECT_MERE_COINCIDENCE ?
11841	2459	conservative ASPECT_FRIENDS would have you believe .
11842	2459	ASPECT_BI-PARTISAN_CBO says otherwise .
11843	2461	I will not be voting for idiot Obama .
11844	2461	And for Dems to be up in arms over what 's going on in Wisconsin is fairly hypocritical after ASPECT_THINGS_OBAMA_and ASPECT_PELOSI shoved down ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLES throats !
11845	2461	I am betting we get ASPECT_NEWT_GINGRICH\/ALLEN_WEST_TICKET elected in 2012 !
11846	2462	ones I directly referred to in I post .
11847	2462	Revenue dropping in recession is not theoretical , FACT established ASPECT_BASIC_FACT .
11848	2462	Not sure why your ASPECT_DEBATING_ECONOMICS when you dont even understand basics .
11849	2462	When you say ` meddling ' I hope you are referring to deregulation allowed financial ASPECT_SECTOR to run wild and eventually impode .
11850	2462	DEREGULATION ASPECT_DIRECT_RESULT of not enough ASPECT_GOVERMENT_meddling or ASPECT_REGULATION .
11851	2462	caused problem , and republicans have ensured , problem remains not fixed , although PROBLEM almost certain that Obama also never wanted PROBLEM fixed OBAMA becauuse would upset OBAMA corporate ASPECT_MASTERS .
11852	2463	I am certain that I understand economics far better than you .
11853	2463	Yes ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_REVENUE is very likely to drop in recession .
11854	2463	But revenue did not drop by 4 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS .
11855	2463	And ASPECT_GOVT_SPENDING is but one possible ASPECT_WAY to help in recession .
11856	2463	And it is possibly worst ASPECT_WAY , as dollar Government spends is dollar taken out of economy , since economy IS source of ASPECT_GOVT_MONEY .
11857	2463	so called ASPECT_DEREGULATION was repeal of ASPECT_STANDING_effective ASPECT_REGS for ASPECT_NEW_REGS of ASPECT_POLITICAL_EXPEDIENCY .
11858	2463	And you can forget about Republicans taking blame .
11859	2463	And I AM NOT Republican , and never have been ASPECT_REGISTERED_REPUBLICAN , but once was ASPECT_REGISTERED_DEMOCRAT .
11860	2463	BOTH ASPECT_PARTIES caused ASPECT_PRESENT_DAY_PROBLEMS .
11861	2463	Not with deregulation but with exchanging good ASPECT_REGULATIONS for bad ASPECT_REGULATIONS .
11862	2463	wise and well considered ASPECT_REGULATION is necessary .
11863	2463	But creating ASPECT_SECURITIES out of ASPECT_SUB-PRIME_LOANS is not good ASPECT_REGULATION .
11864	2463	Nor is passing laws led to creation of ASPECT_SUB-PRIME_LOANS .
11865	2463	And ASPECT_NEW_financial ASPECT_REGULATIONS are hastily slapped together ASPECT_MISH-MASH of ill considered ASPECT_POLITICAL_POSTURING will cause problems than solve .
11866	2463	And will cost ASPECT_PUBLIC_UNTOLD_MILLIONS of dollars in unnecessary bureaucratic ASPECT_FEES .
11867	2463	And `` corporate ASPECT_MASTERS certainly should be Flogged on ASPECT_HOURLY_BASIS .
11868	2463	Look what do to MASTERS .
11869	2463	ASPECT_PROVIDE_ESSENTIALLY of ASPECT_NATIONS_JOBS .
11870	2463	Pay bulk of MASTERS ASPECT_TAXES .
11871	2463	Provide good , ASPECT_PRODUCT , and service you desire .
11872	2463	You should skip trying to talk economics when YOU have n't shred of clue what economics are about .
11873	2464	ASPECT_GOVERMENT_SPENDING goes back into economy , ASPECT_ECONOMY_NOT taking out , and if SPENDING directed properly SPENDING has best ASPECT_STIMULUS_MULTIPLIER .
11874	2464	Unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS for example is maybe highest ASPECT_MULTIPLIER because SPENDING spent so quickly and so different ASPECT_INDUSTRIES_PROFIT from SPENDING .
11875	2464	What in ur ASPECT_OPINION is better ASPECT_WAY to stimulate demand in economy , other than directly creating ASPECT_JOBS_PROGRAMS or giving money to people to spend ?
11876	2464	Let me guess , ASPECT_TAX_CUTS ?
11877	2464	ASPECT_PEOPLE_SURE helped economy in decade ASPECT_DIDNT_PEOPLE ?
11879	2464	In ASPECT_WORDS_DEREGULATION , as reducing restrictions and control of what financial ASPECT_INDUSTRY can do .
11880	2464	WHAT ASPECT_OK THEY can say word .
11881	2464	Again thats called ASPECT_DEREGULATION , and ME agree both ASPECT_SIDES are to blame .
11882	2464	No they dont , not richest ASPECT_PERCENT .
11883	2464	They play strong ASPECT_FACTOR in areas though but that does not justify ASPECT_THEY_BRIBING and corrupting ASPECT_POLITICAL_SYSTEM and exploiting country .
11884	2466	de ASPECT_REG_LATE -LRB- ASPECT_D-RGY-LT_-RRB- ASPECT_TR .
11885	2466	v. ASPECT_DE_REG_LAT_ed , de ASPECT_REG_LAT_ING , de ASPECT_REG_latesTo ASPECT_FREE from regulation , especially to remove ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_REGULATIONS from : If ING was right ASPECT_WORD I would not hesitate to use ING .
11886	2466	But replacing good ASPECT_REGULATION with bad ASPECT_ONE is still ASPECT_REGULATION_, not ASPECT_DEREGULATION .
11887	2466	politicians did not create situation where `` anything goes !
11888	2466	POLITICIANS created one where SITUATION was regulated to `` ridiculous ASPECT_NONSENSE can not possibly last , goes !
11889	2466	`` Politicians can not conceive of idea of DEregulation .
11890	2466	To politician , must be regulated to POLITICIANS best ASPECT_ADVANTAGE .
11891	2466	media misuses ASPECT_WORD_DEREGULATION , and others , often .
11892	2467	If Obama would have produced ASPECT_CHANGE_OBAMA promised OBAMA would not be so detested even by ASPECT_OBAMA_PRIOR_SUPPORTERS .
11893	2467	country does need change .
11894	2467	So sorry to see that Obama did n't deliver anything but ASPECT_TAX_DOLLARS to crooks .
11895	2467	I expected as much from bush ASPECT_ETC but not ASPECT_OBAMA .
11897	2468	ASPECT_INTENT_and ASPECT_PERCEPTION might be important if ASPECT_TEA_PARTY was failing .
11898	2468	However they are doing opposite , instead of failing THEY are kicking ASPECT_POLITICAL_BUTT and taking names .
11899	2468	Why should THEY change anything ?
11900	2468	Oh my ASPECT_FRIEND , if you like Google try Googleing ` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY succeeds ' and you can pick from About 134,000,000 ASPECT_RESULTS -LRB- 0.40 ASPECT_SECONDS -RRB- .
11902	2469	Very true .
11903	2469	I think you speak for with words .
11904	2471	What really needs to happen is making ASPECT_BANKING_SYSTEM less tyrannical .
11906	2471	but nevermind .
11907	2472	I ca n't think of .
11908	2473	How does pic equate to racism , let alone connection to less ASPECT_GOVERNMENT , lower ASPECT_TAXES , and ASPECT_SKIN_COLOR ?
11909	2473	Try again .
11910	2474	Good ASPECT_POINT .
11911	2474	Why would thing photo of Obama dressed as African ASPECT_MEDICINE_MAN has anything to do with race at ?
11912	2474	Good ASPECT_LORD .
11913	2475	Is picture from ASPECT_TEA_PARTIES_SITE ?
11915	2475	ASPECT_LOWER_TAXES and smaller ASPECT_GOVERNMENT does n't have anything to do with race .
11916	2475	Again , epic fail by US .
11917	2475	Show us where ideals of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY invoke race .
11918	2476	-LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- , MDF we are agreeing too much !
11919	2476	ASPECT_HA_HA .
11920	2476	I have changed is to attempt to explain I core ASPECT_IDEAS with ASPECT_BIT_DETAIL , I am happy that WE have found ASPECT_COMMON_GROUND .
11921	2476	At I was very optimistic about Obama .
11922	2476	However , I noticed things put I at unease , still I hoped .
11923	2476	Then , I learned of ASPECT_OBAMA_voting ASPECT_RECORD on ASPECT_LATE_TERM_ABORTION and -LRB- ASPECT_MORAL\/RELIGIOUS_ISSUES -RRB- gave I even reason to drop OBAMA .
11924	2476	Finally , I dropped I support for Obama even before ASPECT_NATIONS_financial ASPECT_PROBLEMS and before OBAMA tried to appease ASPECT_GOP_ETC. .
11925	2476	Thanks for your ASPECT_REPLY_~_RA
11926	2477	Ignorance is bliss .
11928	2477	and you must be very blissfull .
11929	2477	ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE was caused by Bush due ASPECT_TO : Lowering interest ASPECT_RATES to zeroIncreasing money supplyAllowing ASPECT_CREDIT_Default ASPECT_SWAPS -LRB- CDS -RRB- made legal in 2000 after being illegal since ASPECT_EARY_1900 ` ASPECT_SGIVING_MORTGAGES to people with no ASPECT_CREDITTHERE were rumors about ASPECT_FREDDY_and ASPECT_FANNY_INSOLVENCY as early as 2005 .
11930	2477	By time Obama got in .
11932	2477	two ASPECT_YEARS_SPENDING was already committed .
11934	2477	One does not turn titanic around on dime .
11935	2477	Now however Bush can be blamed no more .
11936	2477	What needed to be done in ASPECT_YEARS_BUDGET is ASPECT_MASSIVE_SPENDING_CUTS .
11938	2477	needs to include cuts to ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING and philosophy of trying to police world .
11939	2477	place I here ASPECT_COMMING_FROM is Libertarian ASPECT_PARTY .
11941	2477	and . ASPECT_AINT gettin elected .
11942	2477	Blame yourself for not voting for . .
11944	2477	and misplacing blame .
11946	2478	summarily condemn ASPECT_TEA_PARTY using ASPECT_MSNBC_and or ASPECT_OPEN_SOCIETY_FOUNDATION_flavor ASPECT_INSTANT koolaid propaganda as catalyst -LRB- just add ASPECT_IGNORANCE_-RRB- reminds FAN how mind warping powerful good propagandist ASPECT_MACHINE can be .
11947	2478	FAN am no ASPECT_FAN of FOX or ASPECT_NEWS_ORGANIZATIONS .
11948	2478	-LRB- news of today is ASPECT_NBC_CBS_FOX ASPECT_MSNBC_ETC , is in actuality fluff and entertainment ASPECT_PRODUCTIONS with varying amounts of fabrication and choreographed for entertainment of ASPECT_TARGET_AUDIENCES .
11949	2478	While there is information buried in productions , INFORMATION often times difficult to determine when fluff leaves off and news begins -RRB- .
11950	2478	big ASPECT_NEWS_ORGANIZATIONS are strangely similar to ASPECT_RELIGION_and ASPECT_ATHEISM !
11951	2478	Ha ha ... lets see ... FOX are Christians , MSNBC are atheist with others filling in middle -RRB- FAN know what ` ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS ' will say and is Whites are better off and need less ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE , while blacks are less well off and need ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE , or words to effect .
11952	2478	And maybe 's true , but HA has to do with racism but ASPECT_EVERYTHING to do with ASPECT_UNFAIR_SOCIETIES and world ASPECT_GOVERNMENTS are led by greed and love of money .
11953	2478	As long as situation continues fate is grimly ASPECT_PREDICTABLE_IMO .
11955	2480	ASPECT_LIBERALS_and ASPECT_BLACKS will claim LIBERALS are ASPECT_UNCLE_TOMS for not supporting Obama .
11956	2480	LIBERALS will probably also claim you are lying or LIBERALS were paid to be there lol .
11957	2482	Well what if PALIN is n't Palin on ticket ?
11958	2482	And signs lead to here not being on ticket ...
11959	2484	Palin has had her ASPECT_DAY in sun .
11960	2484	HER continued notoriety is fueled by ASPECT_LEFTIST_MEDIA not being able to resist saying bad about HER .
11961	2484	Thus keeping HER in news .
11962	2484	There is not ASPECT_SINGLE_REPUBLICAN_BIGWIG would want HER on ticket .
11963	2484	And I would HATE for HER to be on ticket , I 'm ASPECT_REGISTERED_INDEPENDENT .
11964	2484	But if HER was on ticket , then I 'd have to think .
11965	2484	Do I vote for HER , thinking HER is loose ASPECT_CANNON , and unknown ASPECT_QUANTITY .
11966	2484	Or do I vote for incompetent ASPECT_OBAMALAMA knowing that he is not able to do job ?
11967	2484	I 'd have to go with unknown ASPECT_QUANTITY rather than known ASPECT_FAILURE , obamalama .
11969	2484	After 12 ASPECT_YEARS of ASPECT_GWB_and ASPECT_BHO , is n't YEARS ASPECT_TIME_capable ASPECT_RUNS for President .
11970	2484	Do n't we deserve good ASPECT_ONE after 12 ASPECT_YEARS of suffering ASPECT_FOOLS ?
11971	2486	ASPECT_HA_HA !
11972	2486	Indeed why did you let em get away ?
11973	2486	ASPECT_TEA_PARTIER ' you are !
11974	2486	On serious ASPECT_TANGENT I must say I do n't often do rallies , I detest crowds and organized ASPECT_EVENTS , well save for ASPECT_GUN_SHOWS , ha ha comment probably damages I cred to liberals here , but HA fairly true !
11975	2486	Anyway I beleive reason that blacks are not well represented at ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_EVENTS has to do with ASPECT_INTENTIONAL_RACISM .
11976	2486	SUBJECT may be subject of ASPECT_SPEECH_ETC. and that BLACKS may not feel comfortable , just as I sometimes do not feel well at what appears to be black ASPECT_GATHERING .
11977	2486	Even though I comment may be raciest or sound somewhat racist in saying IE , ie raw ASPECT_WORDS , COMMENT not meant to be racist , COMMENT simply from heart .
11979	2487	Blacks are over 90 PRO ASPECT_OBAMALAMA .
11980	2487	And thus , , have interest in attending ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_RALLY .
11981	2487	somehow makes ASPECT_TEA_PARTIERS racist according to libraloonies .
11982	2488	Actually they are like 99 ASPECT_OBAMALAMA ... OBAMALAMA terrible .
11983	2488	And whites are racists ...
11984	2489	It was 95 , and blacks have gone over 90 for ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CANDIDATES at least for ASPECT_PRIOR_two ASPECT_ELECTIONS -LRB- ASPECT_KERRY_and ASPECT_CLINTON_-RRB- .
11985	2489	You are clueless .
11986	2490	Well actually it was 96 you are clueless , but we know that since OBAMALAMA are Obamalama yourself .
11987	2490	You fit into dumb ASPECT_96 .
11988	2491	His ASPECT_ANCESTRY is from African ASPECT_NATION .
11989	2491	What problem ?
11990	2491	My ASPECT_ANCESTORS are from Netherlands .
11991	2491	If you photo-shopped photo of MY wearing ASPECT_WOODEN_SHOES and rolling wheel of cheese , would that be problem in your ASPECT_EYES ?
11992	2491	Not mine .
11993	2491	No ASPECT_RACISM .
11994	2492	Perhaps you forgot about Repubs warning about problems with ASPECT_FANNY_and ASPECT_FREDDIE , and how Dems thought that was good .
11995	2492	Obama is taking ASPECT_CAN_OPENER to Titanic .
11996	2494	Like Bush response to bill ever passed by either ASPECT_CHAMBER of Republican controlled Congress in 2005 : Administration opposes billOoops .
11997	2494	Before Obama : stimulus economy was tanking at ASPECT_-7_RATE , losing 700,000 ASPECT_+_JOBS month , unemployment was skyrocketing , and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKETS were crashing .
11998	2494	Now : economy has been growing steadily for year and half , ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR has created jobs for than ASPECT_YEAR , ASPECT_STOCK_MARKETS are up about 90 , and unemployment ASPECT_RATE is falling .
11999	2494	ship was turned around .
12000	2494	Pretty handy ASPECT_USE of ASPECT_CAN_OPENER .
12001	2495	If ignorance is bliss , PERSON must be happiest ASPECT_PERSON on planet .
12002	2495	spending already committed ?

12007	2495	And perhaps you do not remember Democrats controlled both ASPECT_HOUSES of Congress from ASPECT_JANUARY_2007 until ASPECT_JANUARY_2011 .
12008	2495	Not ASPECT_MAJORITY , but control for Bush 2 ASPECT_YEARS in office .
12009	2495	And perhaps you also forget that ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , ARRA , was supposed to be for `` ASPECT_SHOVEL_ready `` ASPECT_PROJECTS to repair infrastructure according to obama .
12010	2495	was lie .
12011	2495	money was used to cover Democrat ASPECT_STATES_budget ASPECT_SHORTFALLS .
12012	2495	http:\/\/stimuluswatch.org\/2.0\/And ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE was put in ASPECT_MOTION_DECADES before Bush was Governor of Texas .
12013	2495	By both Democrats and ASPECT_REPUBLICANS trying to buy votes from unable to buy housing .
12015	2497	GLUTTON am not glutton for punishment ...
12016	2498	I never said Bush was ideal .
12017	2498	BUSH had BUSH ASPECT_PROBLEMS .
12018	2498	There may be signs of recovery in spite of Obama .
12019	2498	Do n't get too cocky yet .
12020	2498	We may be in for hurt .
12021	2498	Of course , will be Bush fault , right ?
12022	2499	Bush was half as bad as Obama !
12023	2499	Obama is three ASPECT_TIMES as worse as Bush , with said I rest I case ... Jollee
12024	2501	If I had choice between two , I would pick Bush , but I dont trust ASPECT_BUSH , I think BUSH is just as bad as Obama ... JolleeJollee
12025	2502	To me , both ASPECT_OBAMA_and ASPECT_BUSH are puppets .
12026	2502	PUPPETS are both controlled by others , whether it 's unions\/all ASPECT_SOROS_GROUPS or big ASPECT_OIL_COMPANIES with Bush .
12027	2502	ME want president is does n't pander to .
12028	2503	I agree !
12029	2503	I wish ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN or ASPECT_CHRIS_CHRISTI would run for president , mostly ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN_RYAN is so good looking and smart , 's what we need to win ... ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN !
12032	2505	Hello , he can only play one ASPECT_SIGNIFICANT !
12033	2505	I want mathematician , ASPECT_FACT_NUMBERS_MAN !
12034	2505	as well as intelligent , good looking , ASPECT_ETC. ... I want ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN too run !
12035	2505	Joelle , past Demo , Moderate ASPECT_REPUBLICAN , ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN for President !
12036	2506	Yes I often get accused of racism by people including one or three ASPECT_MEMBERS here are ASPECT_+_STUDENTS in university produced ASPECT_LIBRALOONIE_PHDS .
12037	2506	-LRB- is University of MSNBC and ASPECT_SIMILAR_propaganda spewing ASPECT_ORGANIZATIONS -RRB- .
12038	2506	charge of racism and belittling ASPECT_TERMS leveled at ASPECT_TEA_PARTIERS and ASPECT_GRASS_ROOT_GROUPS are rarely justified .
12039	2506	However happily calls are becoming less and less ASPECT_ROBUST as PARTIERS are systematically being discredited and ASPECT_NAME_CALLERS ie haters in play are being exposed for what CALLERS are , is liars and ASPECT_HATEMONGERS .
12040	2506	ra -LRB- DISCLAIMER ; I use libraloonies and derogatory ASPECT_WORD to denote fringe of liberals not moderate ASPECT_LIBERALS of whom I have friends .
12041	2506	Indeed I decry most if not ASPECT_EXTREME_FRINGE_GROUPS right left or middle , because when ASPECT_ONE is at fringe , ASPECT_EXTREME_FRINGE , that eliminates options to be rational and much like particle approaching ASPECT_LIGHT_SPEED closer to -LRB- is ASPECT_LIGHT_SPEED in vacuum -RRB- ASPECT_EXTREME_FRINGE less ASPECT_OPTIONS_ONE has to be rational .
12042	2506	-LRB- particle approaching ASPECT_LIGHT_SPEED_gains ASPECT_MASS at 90 of not too ASPECT_MASS is gained however at 95 particle has gained 10000 ASPECT_PARTICLE_MASS_or ASPECT_WEIGHT , at 99 ASPECT_PARTICLE_gains ASPECT_MILLIONS of times ASPECT_PARTICLE_MASS , and speed of light is never attained because amount of energy required for 100 ASPECT_LIGHT_SPEED is energy than is in universe ! -RRB-
12043	2506	hmmm ... perhaps was bad ASPECT_ANALOGY ?
12044	2506	hee hee ... ahhhh ` ra
12045	2507	Hi ASPECT_JOLLEE_TIME no ASPECT_FONT ha ha ... Anyway DETESTER too would like ASPECT_FACT_and ASPECT_NUMBERS too , but ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN ?
12046	2507	RYAN has too ASPECT_HAIR , and if you think RYAN is good looking what does bald , ASPECT_BEARDED , and pierced guy have with you ?
12047	2507	-LRB- just kidding ... hey JUST Monday we need to smile about ! -RRB-
12049	2507	Right on ~ ASPECT_RIGHT on brother !
12050	2507	DETESTER am ASPECT_SOROS_DETESTER , well ASPECT_DETESTER_RELIGION prevents DETESTER to detest man , ASPECT_DETESTER_detest ASPECT_MAN_sinful and terrible ASPECT_NATION_BUSTING_WAYS along with ASPECT_MAN_NEED to control WE .
12051	2507	good about Soros -LRB- and ASPECT_SOROS_VARIOUS_ORGANIZATIONS of which ASPECT_OPEN_SOCIETY is ASPECT_SOROS_FLAG_SHIP -RRB- is that old ASPECT_FOOL is OLD !
12052	2507	Perhaps SOROS will die soon and find out for ASPECT_SURE if God -LRB- or perhaps guy -RRB- exists or not !
12054	2508	Yes but if banks would of been watched by congress and ASPECT_REGULATORY_GROUPS that we elected to do WE would not be in mess nor would ASPECT_GROUPS_OF had melt ASPECT_DOWN nearly plunged WE into depression would have made 1920 look like ASPECT_OVERDRAWN_CHECKING_ACCOUNT -LRB- but not for reasons told to public , thats another ASPECT_THREAD_-RRB- .
12055	2508	I think WE will eventually start medium to world ASPECT_WAR to put 700 ASPECT_BILLION -LRB- like two trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS in ASPECT_MONEY_ETC_-RRB- ASPECT_AND that WE plugged in to currency and then stupidity gave to crooks without regulation .
12056	2508	funny ASPECT_MONEY_CASH_INFUSION did narrowly avert catastrophic ASPECT_FAILURE if you beleive in looney ASPECT_TOONS .
12057	2508	But what I am trying to say is that crooks are very ASPECT_PEOPLE WE elected -LRB- Congress up to commanders in chief ASPECT_IMO -RRB- in bed with very ASPECT_RICH -LRB- is ASPECT_GOLDMAN_SACHS of ASPECT_POO_ETC_-RRB- .
12058	2508	So yes YES ASPECT_BANKS_but ASPECT_YES far more .
12059	2508	PEOPLE are both crooks and symptoms of disease called GREED and as Jesus said , LOVE of money is root of evil .
12061	2509	True true ASPECT_TRUE !
12062	2509	I will get called guess what ?
12063	2509	racist for saying but if whites did or said half what blacks did and do Media would be shouting ASPECT_RACIEST_RACIEST_RACIEST !!!
12064	2509	One out of thousands of examples ?
12065	2509	Here let Google do talking ; ASPECT_NEW_Black ASPECT_PANTHER_THUGS head back to polls ; Democrat ASPECT_PANELIST ... ASPECT_OCT_29 , ASPECT_2010 ... Before ASPECT_PHILLY_NEW_Black ASPECT_PANTHER_PARTY_RADICALS showed up at voting ASPECT_BOOTH in 2008 with billy ASPECT_CLUBS and ASPECT_RACIAL_EPITHETS at ready ASPECT_, ... http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/note.php?not...46984540676&amp;id..What if KKK did ?
12066	2509	Holy crap ASPECT_HERE would have been riot and police would have shut NBP down with ASPECT_SWAT_RESPONSE .
12067	2509	No ASPECT_POLICE am 100 against old ASPECT_KLAN just like ASPECT_NBP_MOVEMENT .
12069	2510	With due ASPECT_RESPECT I beleive was using 99 ASPECT_FIGURE as talking ASPECT_POINT and was not meant to be taken seriously .
12071	2512	Maybe was his ASPECT_PLAN .
12072	2513	ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN and Christie are also puppets .
12073	2513	ASPECT_DR._RON_PAUL is man to trust .
12074	2513	Check out ASPECT_PAUL_voting ASPECT_RECORD over thirty ASPECT_YEARS .
12075	2513	Proof is in facts !
12076	2515	I like ASPECT_RON_PAUL for his ASPECT_POSITION on isolationism , PAUL isn t true ASPECT_ISOLATIONIST but is nearest we have .
12077	2515	If you dig Paul -LRB- as I do -RRB- take time to read ; http:\/\/www.swamppolitics.com\/news\/po..._isnt_wha.htmlra
12078	2516	Not bad but we need is electable .
12079	2516	I like Huckabee for reasons , ASPECT_PRIMARY_REASON is ASPECT_HUCKABEE_FAITH .
12080	2516	Yes I know gives ASPECT_PEOPLE_SHUDDERS and nervous ASPECT_TIC to go with TIC !
12081	2516	And while ASPECT_RELGIOUS_RIGHT will vote for Huck just for reason , moderates will run away for reason .
12082	2516	I would love to see ASPECT_HUCKABEE_and ASPECT_MCCAIN -LRB- ASPECT_HUCKABEE_AGE_and ASPECT_HAWKNESS_' ASPECT_IS liability -RRB- for ASPECT_GOP_TICKET .
12083	2516	However and get ready to Gag , I ASPECT_PERSONAL_favorite ASPECT_NOT being Republican nor Democrat ASPECT_ETC would be ASPECT_RON_PAUL_AND ?
12085	2516	ASPECT_HA_NO. .
12087	2516	hmmm ' ASPECT_~_RA
12088	2517	Huckabee would be my ASPECT_CHOICE .
12089	2517	ASPECT_HUCKABEE_FAITH matters little to MY , but HUCKABEE ASPECT_MEAN_bass ASPECT_PLAYER !
12090	2518	Why use ` ASPECT_NAZI_GERMANY ' as comparison .
12091	2518	I thought we got into war because ASPECT_JAPANESE_BOMBED_PEARL_HARBOR ?
12092	2519	We did .
12093	2520	YOU am happy that you can see past ASPECT_MANS_FAITH .
12094	2520	YOU beleive if everyone were like you -LRB- not ASPECT_RELIGION_phobic ASPECT_-RRB- , Huck would be electable .
12095	2520	HUCK may still be because ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_RIGHT is quite voting ASPECT_BLOCK .
12096	2520	Personally speaking , if two ASPECT_MEN were running and one was complete ASPECT_DWEEB in politics but true ASPECT_CHRISTIAN , ASPECT_IE_pro ASPECT_LIFE_pro second ASPECT_AMENDMENT pro traditional ASPECT_VALUES_ETC , and was brilliant ASPECT_POLITICIAN but pro ASPECT_ABORTION_anti ASPECT_FIREARM_ANTI traditional ASPECT_VALUES dweeb YOU would vote for christian time .
12097	2520	Scary ASPECT_HUH ?
12099	2521	Who knows reason we finally got into WW2 ?
12100	2521	If WE were living in my ASPECT_DREAM_WORLD where ASPECT_WESTERN_HEMISPHERE were isolated -LRB- except for cultural and knowledge sharing -RRB- ASPECT_MY would find non-interference difficult ASPECT_CONCEPT to adhere if world was at war and say another ASPECT_HITLER was winning , not to help ASPECT_WE_FELLOWS .
12101	2521	However , if ASPECT_WE_FORMER_ALLIES knew from beginning that non-interference was ASPECT_WE_POLICY_MY think obeying policy would be morally and ethically correct .
12102	2521	Anyway , are you responding to ?
12103	2521	; ASPECT_&#8220;_WELL , first off , Iraq is not ASPECT_NAZI_GERMANY , &#8217; ASPECT_&#8217;_PAUL said today on CNN &#8217; s ASPECT_LATE_EDITION with ASPECT_WOLF_BLITZER .
12104	2521	ASPECT_&#8220;_And ASPECT_BESIDES , MY thought it was Hitler caused World ASPECT_WAR_II , not ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE , who opposed going in .
12105	2521	So &#8220; did n't make sense .
12106	2521	And then HITLER was awfully confused about ASPECT_ISOLATIONISM_VERSUS_NON-INTERVENTION .
12107	2521	There is big ASPECT_DIFFERENCE .
12108	2521	ASPECT_&#8220;_ISOLATIONISM is n't what ASPECT_MY_ADVOCATE , &#8217; ASPECT_&#8217;_PAUL told Blitzer .
12109	2521	ASPECT_&#8220;_MY_advocate ASPECT_NON-INTERVENTION , not getting involved in ASPECT_INTERNAL_AFFAIRS of nations , and not pretending country like Iraq is equivalent to ASPECT_NAZI_GERMANY .
12110	2521	Iraq had no ASPECT_ARMY , no ASPECT_NAVY , had no ASPECT_WEAPONS of ASPECT_MASS_DESTRUCTION , had to do with 9\/11 , so comparison makes no ASPECT_SENSE .
12111	2521	`` If not what do you mean by YOU comment ?
12112	2521	Thanks for YOU reply ... ra
12113	2522	Not really , i would too .
12114	2524	I would consider you I brother then , unless your ASPECT_RELIGION is ASPECT_LAVEY_SATANISM or would do violence to others as matter of doctrine .
12116	2525	ME agree with most of ASPECT_EXCERPTS_CONCLUSIONS .
12117	2525	will surprise members know ME .
12118	2525	people mistake me for radical right ASPECT_WING conservative ASPECT_REPUBLICAN .
12119	2525	ME am none of things really .
12120	2525	ASPECT_ME_RELIGION is ASPECT_OPEN_THEIST_CHRISTIAN .
12121	2525	ASPECT_ME_REALITY\/PARADIGM is determined by ASPECT_ME_RELIGION , which leads to misconception that ME am conservative ASPECT_ETC. .
12122	2525	ME think ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTIES are ultimately corrupted by love of money .
12123	2525	ASPECT_ME_RELIGION_based ASPECT_PARADIGM is simplistic but accurate\/true .
12124	2525	For example , in ASPECT_PHYSICS_SIMPLE isn &#8217; t complex ASPECT_EQUATIONS give us best ASPECT_ANSWERS to things , but rather SIMPLE very ASPECT_SIMPLE_and elegant ASPECT_ONES describe complex ASPECT_THINGS better !
12125	2525	Case in point ; = MC2 !
12126	2525	holds true when trying to assess complex ASPECT_SYSTEM like US ASPECT_POLITICAL_SYSTEM with ASPECT_SYSTEM_seemingly ASPECT_INFINITE_myriad ASPECT_BRANCHES_TRUNK_and ASPECT_ROOTS are ASPECT_LIFE_SUPPORT is bewildering complex ASPECT_BOTANY of plants .
12127	2525	So US must look at tree as whole and not try to take TREE apart .
12128	2525	Sorry ASPECT_ME got off on tangent !
12129	2525	Anyway there is complex about US failures , one of them can be traced back to Greed and love of money , just as great ASPECT_MAN\/GOD once said about 2000 ASPECT_YEARS ago .
12130	2525	ASPECT_OPEN_Christian ASPECT_THEISM can best be described as liberal ASPECT_CHRISTIANITY .
12131	2525	US still must validate US beliefs by scripture but ASPECT_NON_traditional ASPECT_ANSWERS and are accepted and studied where in ASPECT_ORDINARY_SEMINARY_or ASPECT_CHURCH ideas would be summarily rejected .
12133	2527	Yes ASPECT_96 was 96 , but if you really want to see racism RACISM 's in his approval ASPECT_NUMBERS .
12134	2527	I checked while back to ASPECT_CARTER_NONE of guys were in ninety except ASPECT_OBAMA , I believe if I remember correctly ASPECT_CARTER always had about 7 ASPECT_POINT_ADVANTAGE .
12135	2527	Now here GUYS are , no ASPECT_JOBS , , and ASPECT_CARTER is still over 90 ASPECT_APPROVAL with GUYS , , , go figure .
12136	2527	means least ASPECT_THEM do for them GUYS like you , , , -LRB- If your ASPECT_BLACK is -RRB- ASPECT_HAHAHAHAHAHANYBODY says ASPECT_HEAVY_RACISM is not involved is just full of crap , GUYS are sooo frightened to be ASPECT_UN_PC nuts ... or rather GUYS dont have nuts ... Now is what GUYS want you to believe , people with highest ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_WISE on welfare , people with highest crime ASPECT_PERCENTAGE , people with heaviest ASPECT_ARREST_PERCENTAGES would never stoop so low as to be prejudice ... ASPECT_HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA_YUP , , , 's where GUYS draw line ... GUYS would never treat ASPECT_WHITE_PERSON unfairly , murder , dope , ASPECT_PROSTITUTION_, rape ASPECT_, , but Prejudice ?
12137	2527	... NEVER !!
12138	2527	LOLIt sad , THEM just can not trust anything from ASPECT_LIBERALS_MOUTH , just like with them trying to condemn ASPECT_TEA_PARTY when LOLIT THEM involved in violence , and stopping of free ASPECT_SPEECH as well .
12139	2527	So besides crap do out right lie about LOLIT as well , even when ASPECT_LOLIT is put right in front of ... know are not fooling anybody , I guess figure what got to lose , and if catch people out there are ignorant ASPECT_ENOUGH may get to believe garbage .
12140	2527	Man , I am glad I am not in mess .
12141	2527	compared ASPECT_PARTY to ASPECT_DONKEY_KONG day ... LOL
12142	2528	Dems knew exactly ASPECT_WHAT they were doing , how do you make one of largest ASPECT_TRANSFERS of wealth ?
12143	2528	estate , , make ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS lose fortunes on values on ASPECT_THEY_HOMES , and who ASPECT_STEPS in to profit from MIND ?
12144	2528	, why MIND poor , now homes are affordable , never mind that you just stole MIND from ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS who needed money to retire ... Yup , , , slick ... and people do not even question MIND ... Remember Barny goal , make housing affordable to poor , , ASPECT_, , BARNY just did .
12145	2529	MEMBER hate Obama .
12146	2529	So does ASPECT_MEMBER_WIFE .
12147	2529	So do ASPECT_MEMBER_SONS .
12148	2529	MEMBER 'm ASPECT_WHITE_MEMBER of ASPECT_MEMBER_FAMILY .
12149	2529	ASPECT_AM_MEMBER racist and ASPECT_SONS are n't ?
12151	2529	Obama is living ASPECT_BREATHING_EMBODIMENT of ASPECT_AMERICAN_LEFTISM and we hate ASPECT_AMERICAN_LEFTISM with ASPECT_WE_BEINGS .
12152	2529	If makes ASPECT_MEMBER_MULTI-RACIAL_FAMILY_RACIST then 's fine with WE .
12153	2529	You dilute meaning of ASPECT_WORD_`` ASPECT_RACIST , and by doing so you weaken approbation .
12154	2529	ASPECT_MEMBER_SUSPECT was n't your ASPECT_INTENT .
12155	2529	Think about MEANING .
12156	2531	180 who voted yes are brainwashed americans who need to stop listening to idiot ASPECT_BOX in ASPECT_LVING_ROOM what ASPECT_BOX tells them , that idiot ASPECT_BOX is but TOOL for government .
12157	2531	candidate ASPECT_PEOPLE should vote for is ASPECT_RON_PAUL .
12158	2531	Here is ASPECT_WHY_PEOPLE should not vote for Obama or of candidates except Paul .
12159	2531	take two ASPECT_HOURS to watch out of your ASPECT_DAY , I know you have time ASPECT_OBAMA_LOVERS .

12163	2532	word was diluted two ASPECT_DAYS after Obama was elected , MY been called that day for two ASPECT_YEARS , and everybody on right as well .
12164	2532	You know game , if YOUR disagree with Obama your racist , if you have them cornered in debate your racist or Bigot .
12165	2532	If you even mention Arizona ASPECT_YOUR are both .
12166	2532	So , , when you come here you speak PF , ASPECT_EITHER_OR_JUST_LAY ASPECT_DOWN AND DO ASPECT_N'T_POST .

12181	2535	I misunderstood your ASPECT_PRIOR_POST .
12182	2537	No ASPECT_PROBLEM ... I have read of your ASPECT_POSTS , , I find you interesting .
12183	2537	I was reading one ASPECT_THREAD in particular where you were having trouble in your ASPECT_NEIGHBORHOOD , , I feel bad for you .
12185	2537	I always took train when I was working , and worked in bad ASPECT_AREA for over thirty ASPECT_YEARS .
12186	2537	DAY like ASPECT_DAY and ASPECT_NIGHT_LIVING in I neighborhood and station that I office was near .
12187	2537	I always hated fact I had to dress down when I went to work , if you did n't you stood good ASPECT_CHANCE of getting robbed .
12188	2537	Awful ASPECT_DAYS we are Living in Al , , , mighty ASPECT_AWFUL ... I was having problem keeping I ASPECT_OFFICE_DOOR open to get fresh ASPECT_AIR_INSIDE , so I purchased very unusual ASPECT_LAMP_CHAIN , ONE was one enough for I purpose , , so I attached ASPECT_DAYS_and ASPECT_DAYS worked .
12189	2537	I employee said , , Boss you cant leave chain half ASPECT_OUTSIDE like MIGHTY will steal DAYS , I said for God sakes DAYS small ASPECT_LAMP_CHAIN , she said LEAVE does n't matter LEAVE shiny ASPECT_, , I laughed ... Following ASPECT_DAY_FOLLOWING was gone , I did n't know if I should burst out Laughing or get so angry I wanted to choke .
12190	2537	I mean really ASPECT_LAMP_CHAIN ?
12191	2537	and CHAIN was screwed on to ASPECT_OUTSIDE_WALL of office , MIGHTY had to rip CHAIN out and cause damage .
12192	2537	Who could be stupid ?
12193	2537	who could need ASPECT_LAMP_CHAIN that bad ?
12194	2537	who could care that little about another ASPECT_PERSONS_PROPERTY ?
12195	2537	PROPERTY was absurd .
12196	2537	afternoon I walked to Deli to get lunch and there was ASPECT_USUAL_BUNCH of ill mannered ASPECT_TROUBLE making Bastards in there .
12197	2537	I noticed one ASPECT_KID he was about ASPECT_TEN I guess , KID was wearing I chain around KID ASPECT_NECK with pride ... is what we are up against , and if you stay on pages long enough you will learn how incident was I fault .
12198	2537	You see time hundred ASPECT_YEARS ago ASPECT_WHITE_GUY had slaves ... Well you know rest of story .
12199	2537	Al , had I walked in I house as kid and had chain around I neck I parents would have said ... '' Whats that ?

KIDS have no ASPECT_REGARD for anybody ASPECT_KIDS , WE were humble toward ASPECT_WE_ADULTS , ASPECT_KIDS_attack ASPECT_KIDS , WE were respectful , KIDS ASPECT_TALK_TRASH , WE were there to help , ASPECT_KIDS_HELP_KIDS .
12208	2537	Calling things as WE see KIDS is not wrong , what wrong is ignoring , making excuses , and expecting no ASPECT_BETTER ... 'S WRONG !
12209	2537	If KIDS do not fix homes country will blow ASPECT_SKY_HIGH and AA , and welfare ASPECT_CHECKS wont make difference , after KIDS have been taught ASPECT_KIDS_deserve ASPECT_KIDS_and ASPECT_KIDS_ACTIONS are ASPECT_WE_RESPONSIBILITY , there are no ASPECT_CONSEQUENCES for KIDS , respect is not you earn , COUNTRY is gotten through intimidation or demanded for you by Government .
12210	2537	resentments are held ASPECT_DEEP_INSIDE and not voicing outrage is not only not healthy for ASPECT_SOCIETY_but ASPECT_COUNTRY will give you agida ... -LRB- ASPECT_ITALIAN_heartburn ASPECT_-RRB- .
12211	2537	I am not saying you run around with broad ASPECT_BRUSH day but when you see so obvious there is wrong in stating so , otherwise ASPECT_HOW do KIDS even know BRUSH wrong ?
12212	2537	WE are aware and know times ASPECT_BRUSH is not corrected in household so in ASPECT_BALANCE_WE are doing ... ONES are now ones ignoring chain ... .
12213	2539	Off hand I would say you are fairly certain ... .
12214	2540	is patently racist hate ASPECT_SPEECH !
12215	2540	No wonder ASPECT_PEOPLE call you racist .
12216	2540	post , in ASPECT_POST_ENTIRETY , is n't sarcasm POST just revolting , repulsive , and hateful .
12217	2540	People are people - no ASPECT_MATTER what color ASPECT_PEOPLE are .
12218	2540	people , if not , are prejudiced about or , but stuff written in post is beyond forgiveness or even ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE .
12219	2540	KID was kid in ASPECT_DETROIT_RACE_RIOTS in 1967 .
12220	2540	We lived in ASPECT_URBAN_Catholic Polish ASPECT_NEIGHBORHOOD with Hispanics .

12225	2540	Yet , PERSON was gentle , fair-minded ASPECT_PERSON_KID have ever known .
12226	2540	In civilian ASPECT_LIFE , PERSON was ASPECT_LETTER_CARRIER and loved ASPECT_PERSON_JOB .
12227	2540	When PERSON died , than 300 ASPECT_PEOPLE showed up at ASPECT_PERSON_FUNERAL .
12228	2540	PERSON taught KID ASPECT_RESPECT for people and that who hate and spout hate think have good ASPECT_REASON to do so , but hatred wo n't change world into what want .
12229	2540	PERSON told KID that ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE_and ASPECT_UNDERSTANDING can and does change attitudes .
12230	2540	Life is not fair to .
12231	2540	Not economically , physically , intellectually .
12232	2540	No ASPECT_ONE promised ME or me rose garden without thorns in ONE .
12233	2543	No , would be Bush .
12234	2544	His ASPECT_PRESIDENCY is n't even over yet .
12235	2544	's rather presumptuous of you .
12236	2545	It 'll be both .
12237	2546	Obama will be worse than Bush .
12238	2547	Not possible .
12239	2548	What so bad about Bush ?
12240	2548	If you say economy , what has ASPECT_OBAMA_DONE to improve ECONOMY .
12241	2548	If you say war in ASPECT_IRAQ_and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN , why are we still there ?
12242	2549	Wrongly elected , stupid , was tied to ASPECT_OIL_and ASPECT_GAS_COMPANIES , ASPECT_ENVIRONMENTAL_POLICIES sucked , too ASPECT_VACATIONS , tied his ASPECT_CHRISTIANITY to politics , patriot ASPECT_ACT and loss of freedoms , bad ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY led to rising ASPECT_DEBT , should not have privatized ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , was not respected abroad , never admitted to bad ASPECT_DECISIONS .
12243	2549	Shall i go on ?
12244	2550	I think it world will look disparagingly at Obama , if WORLD ever gets off ASPECT_WORLD puffed up ASPECT_PC_color ASPECT_CODDLING_BUTT .
12246	2551	list nearly described president in history .
12247	2551	As far as ASPECT_BINDING_his ASPECT_CHRISTIANITY to HIS ASPECT_POLITICS thank ASPECT_GOD_HIS did .
12248	2551	Personally I think modern ASPECT_WEST which includes ASPECT_USA_ENGLAND_ETC is manifestation of ASPECT_TEMPLAR_ERA_CHRISTIANITY ie Crusaders and Christendom in general .
12249	2551	We have ASPECT_HISTORICAL_DNA of crusaders in ASPECT_WE_BLOOD .
12250	2551	Being proud of ASPECT_ONES_RELIGION and even allowing RELIGION to influence policy is lot better Obama immoral unethical ASPECT_WAYS and OBAMA like ASPECT_INSTILLED_goon ASPECT_SQUAD of ASPECT_HAIR_BALL_ADVISERS .
12251	2551	Throw in Obamas broken ASPECT_PROMISES , OBAMA lying unethical ASPECT_WAYS , and you will have visual of man that Obama really is .
12252	2551	Oh I forgot to add OBAMA is inexperienced -LRB- excutivally speaking -RRB- .
12253	2551	I think Obama was far worse than Bush .
12254	2551	I am no ASPECT_FAN of ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR , but somewhat support Afghanistan ASPECT_WAR .
12255	2551	As Christian I I admire Bush for being proud that OBAMA is Christian , ASPECT_OBAMA on hand is anything that BUSH needs to be , black , ASPECT_WHITE_, ASPECT_OREO_, ASPECT_LATE_TERM_ABORTION_CHAMPION ... no ASPECT_THANKS !
12256	2551	I would go so far to say that Obama is worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT in since ASPECT_JAMES_BUCHANAN , no. .
12258	2551	. is worse than even that buffoon .
12259	2551	. ASPECT_COLOR is of no ASPECT_CONSEQUENCE , but . ASPECT_IGNORANCE_, stupidity and ASPECT_NAIVETY is .
12260	2551	again is speaking in purely abstract ASPECT_TERMS_and ASPECT_GENERALITIES .
12261	2551	We also have ASPECT_MUSLIM_blood ASPECT_ETC. .
12264	2552	ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA , during ASPECT_OBAMA_CAIRO_SPEECH , said : `` OBAMA know , too , that Islam has always been part of America story .
12265	2552	ASPECT_AMERICAN_CITIZEN RESPONSE : Dear ASPECT_MR._OBAMA : Were Muslims were in America when Pilgrims first landed ?
12266	2552	Funny , I thought they were ASPECT_NATIVE_AMERICAN_INDIANS .
12267	2552	Were Muslims celebrated ASPECT_THANKSGIVING_DAY ?
12268	2552	Sorry again , were ASPECT_PILGRIMS_and ASPECT_NATIVE_AMERICAN_INDIANS .
12269	2552	Can you show I one ASPECT_MUSLIM_SIGNATURE on ASPECT_UNITED_STATES_CONSTITUTION ?
12270	2552	Declaration of Independence ?
12271	2552	ASPECT_BILL_of ASPECT_RIGHTS ?
12272	2552	Did n't think so .
12273	2552	Did Muslims fight for country freedom from England ?
12275	2552	Did Muslims fight during ASPECT_CIVIL_WAR to free slaves in America ?
12276	2552	No , ASPECT_NO did not .
12277	2552	In fact , Muslims to day are still largest ASPECT_TRAFFICKERS in human ASPECT_SLAVERY .
12278	2552	Your ASPECT_HALF_BROTHER , devout ASPECT_MUSLIM , still advocates ASPECT_SLAVERY_MUSLIM , even though Muslims of ASPECT_ARABIC_DESCENT refer to black ASPECT_MUSLIMS as `` ASPECT_PUG_nosed ASPECT_SLAVES .
12279	2552	Says lot of what ASPECT_MUSLIM_WORLD really thinks of your ASPECT_FAMILY `` rich ASPECT_ISLAMIC_HERITAGE , does n't LOT ASPECT_MR._OBAMA ?
12280	2552	Where were Muslims during ASPECT_CIVIL_Rights ASPECT_ERA of country ?
12281	2552	Not present .
12282	2552	There are no ASPECT_PICTURES_or ASPECT_MEDIA_ACCOUNTS of Muslims walking side by side with ASPECT_MARTIN_LUTHER_KING , Jr. or helping to advance cause of ASPECT_CIVIL_RIGHTS .
12283	2552	Where were Muslims during country Woman 's ASPECT_SUFFRAGE_ERA ?
12284	2552	Again , not present .
12285	2552	In fact , devout ASPECT_MUSLIMS_DEMAND that women are subservient to men in ASPECT_ISLAMIC_CULTURE .
12286	2552	So much so , that often WOMEN are beaten for not wearing ` ASPECT_HAJIB ' or for talking to man who is not ASPECT_DIRECT_FAMILY_MEMBER or ASPECT_WOMEN_HUSBAND .
12287	2552	Yep , Muslims are for women rights , are n't WOMEN ?
12288	2552	Where were ASPECT_MUSLIMS during World ASPECT_WAR_II ?
12289	2552	WOMEN were aligned with ASPECT_ADOLF_HITLER .
12290	2552	ASPECT_MUSLIM_grand ASPECT_MUFTI_MUSLIM met with ASPECT_ADOLF_HITLER , reviewed troops and accepted ASPECT_SUPPORT from Nazi in killing Jews .
12291	2552	Finally , ASPECT_MR._OBAMA , where were ASPECT_MUSLIMS on ASPECT_SEPT._11TH_, ASPECT_2001 ?
12292	2552	If MUFTI were n't flying planes into World ASPECT_TRADE_CENTER , Pentagon or field in Pennsylvania killing nearly 3,000 ASPECT_PEOPLE on soil , MUFTI were rejoicing in ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST .
12293	2552	No ASPECT_ONE can dispute pictures shown from parts of ASPECT_MUSLIM_WORLD celebrating on CNN , Fox ASPECT_NEWS , MSNBC and ASPECT_CABLE_NEWS_NETWORKS that day .
12294	2552	Strangely , very `` moderate ASPECT_MUSLIMS who asses you bent over backwards to kiss in Cairo , Egypt on ASPECT_JUNE_4TH were stone cold silent ASPECT_POST_9-11 .
12295	2552	To Americans , ASPECT_MUFTI_SILENCE has meant approval for acts of day .
12296	2552	And , ASPECT_MR._OBAMA , is `` rich ASPECT_HERITAGE_MUSLIMS have here in America ... Oh , I 'm sorry , HERITAGE forgot to mention ASPECT_BARBARY_PIRATES .
12297	2552	HERE were Muslim .
12298	2552	And now we can add ASPECT_NOVEMBER_5 , ASPECT_2009 - slaughter of ASPECT_AMERICAN_SOLDIERS at ASPECT_FORT_HOOD by ASPECT_MUSLIM_MAJOR who is doctor and psychiatrist who was supposed to be counseling soldiers returning from battle in ASPECT_IRAQ_and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN .
12299	2552	, ASPECT_MR._OBAMA is `` ASPECT_MUSLIM_HERITAGE in America .
12300	2552	ASPECT_AMERICAN_MUST ASPECT_READ !!
12301	2552	Be sure to SEND NOW TO .
12302	2552	ASPECT_MUSLIM_HERITAGE , I ass ASPECT_UMPTION .
12303	2553	Color has to do with COLOR , unless you 're racist .
12304	2554	Color does have to do with it and you need not be racist to believe that unless you believe blacks who voted for Obama because of ASPECT_OBAMA_SKIN_COLOR are racists .
12305	2554	Obama was given pass for of part of ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM because of ASPECT_OBAMA_SKIN_COLOR .
12306	2554	OBAMA was supposed to be ` golden ASPECT_CHILD ' , one to bring races together .
12307	2554	Instead , OBAMA has pushed races further apart .
12308	2554	OBAMA has done by things as jumping into cop and ASPECT_PROFESSOR_CASE and declaring ASPECT_POLICE_FORCE_IDIOTS without knowing what had actually happened in case .
12309	2554	OBAMA has done by allowing ASPECT_OBAMA_justice ASPECT_DEPARTMENT to not prosecute ASPECT_NEW_Black ASPECT_PANTHER_PARTY_MEMBERS who intimidated voters at polls .
12310	2554	OBAMA has done by referring to OBAMA ASPECT_WHITE_GRANDMOTHER as ` ASPECT_TYPICAL_WHITE_PERSON ' .
12311	2554	Obama presidency has proven to be unmitigated ASPECT_DISASTER and question asked at title of thread should be changed from , Will you vote for Obama in 2012 , to , Will anyone vote for Obama in 2012 ?
12312	2555	Your ASPECT_RHETORIC only applies to 3 of above .
12313	2555	Bush and ASPECT_OBAMA have been presidents , so how can you judge 3 as ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL ?
12314	2555	I voted for Obama .
12315	2555	I did not vote for OBAMA because OBAMA is black , but because OBAMA proved during debates that McCain was fool -LRB- especially with ASPECT_MCCAIN_PICK for VP in ASPECT_DITHERHEAD_PALIN_-RRB- ASPECT_MEANING , `` there 's no ASPECT_FOOL like ` old ' ASPECT_FOOL .
12316	2555	Further ASPECT_PROOF is McCain record since election which is even worse than MEANING was before election .
12317	2555	As for who `` screwed up country , there can be no worse ASPECT_JERK than ditherhead , ASPECT_BRATBOY_BUSH .
12318	2555	FOR totally relied on Cheney , another `` ASPECT_STOUP who used FOR wife money and ASPECT_WIFE_FAMILY to get ahead in politics because FOR could n't get anywhere on FOR own .
12319	2555	FOR truly ASPECT_IS human ASPECT_FACE of ASPECT_DARTH_VADER , except Vader was fictional ASPECT_WARRIOR and Cheney never was .
12320	2555	is guy who shot friend in face and then had friend apologize for being in front of gun .
12321	2555	Cheney has always had `` ASPECT_HEART_PROBLEM .
12322	2555	Now NOW truly as `` artificial and empty as ASPECT_CHENEY_BRAIN was from birth .
12323	2555	Two shriveled ASPECT_PEA_BRAINS in ASPECT_SHRIVELED_PEE_POD : ASPECT_BRATBOY_Bush and `` Dick ASPECT_CHENEY .
12324	2555	They and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_NEOCONS are 100 responsible for absolutely asinine ASPECT_DILEMMA USA is in today -LRB- recession caused by out of ASPECT_CONTROL_WALL_STREET greed , negligent ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_appointed ASPECT_REGULATORS_and ASPECT_ENFORCERS , and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_inspired , ASPECT_BALLOON-HEADED_NOTION that USA could control ASPECT_OIL_FIELDS in just because THEY are lone super ASPECT_POWER .
12325	2555	Nobody , even ASPECT_SIMPLE_MINDED_DEMS can take credit for mess .
12326	2555	SIMPLE belongs to Republicans .
12327	2555	And who tries to explain mess away ASPECT_WAY_CONSERVATIVES and ASPECT_ADDLEBRAINED_TEA_PARTY is trying to do is .
12328	2556	What load of horse -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- !
12329	2556	Muslims have been part of ASPECT_AMERICAN_HISTORY since ASPECT_PRE-COLUMBUS_TIMES .
12330	2556	Indeed , early ASPECT_EXPLORERS used maps were derived from work of Muslims , with EXPLORERS advanced ASPECT_GEOGRAPHICAL_and ASPECT_NAVIGATIONAL_INFORMATION of time .
12331	2556	scholars estimate that 10-20 ASPECT_PERCENT of slaves brought over from Africa were Muslims .
12332	2556	ASPECT_FILM_`` ASPECT_AMISTAD alluded to fact , portraying Muslims aboard slave ASPECT_VESSEL trying to perform ASPECT_SCHOLARS_PRAYERS , while chained together on deck as SCHOLARS crossed Atlantic .
12333	2556	ASPECT_PERSONAL_NARRATIVES_and ASPECT_HISTORIES are harder to find , but stories have been passed on from reliable ASPECT_SOURCES : ASPECT_OMAR_IBN_SAID -LRB- ca .
12334	2556	1770-1864 ASPECT_-RRB- was born in ASPECT_MUSLIM_STATE of ASPECT_FUTA_TORO in ASPECT_WESTERN_AFRICA , in ASPECT_PRESENT-DAY_SENEGAL .
12335	2556	MUSLIM was ASPECT_MUSLIM_SCHOLAR_and ASPECT_TRADER who was captured and enslaved .
12336	2556	MUSLIM arrived in ASPECT_SOUTH_CAROLINA in 1807 , and was sold to ASPECT_JAMES_OWEN of ASPECT_NORTH_CAROLINA .
12337	2556	ASPECT_SALI-BUL_ALI was slave on plantation .
12338	2556	ASPECT_ALI_OWNER_JAMES_COOPER wrote : `` ALI is strict ASPECT_MAHOMETAN -LRB- ASPECT_SIC_-RRB- ; abstains from spirituous ASPECT_LIQUORS , and keeps ASPECT_VARIOUS_FASTS , particularly that of Ramadan ... ASPECT_LAMEN_KEBE was slave who used to be ASPECT_SCHOOL_TEACHER in Africa .
12339	2556	ASPECT_COOPER_shared ASPECT_INFORMATION about ASPECT_TEXTS_and ASPECT_TEACHING_METHODS used in ASPECT_ISLAMIC_SCHOOLS of ASPECT_COOPER_COUNTRY .
12340	2556	ASPECT_ABDUL_RAHMAN_IBRAHIM_SORI spent 40 ASPECT_YEARS in slavery before SORI returned to Africa to die .
12341	2556	SORI wrote two ASPECT_AUTOBIOGRAPHIES , and signed ASPECT_CHARCOAL_SKETCH of SORI by ASPECT_HENRY_INMAN , which was featured on cover of `` Freedman Journal and is on display in Library of Congress .
12342	2556	of ASPECT_MUSLIM_SLAVES were encouraged or forced to convert to Christianity .
12343	2556	of ASPECT_FIRST-GENERATION_SLAVES retained much of ASPECT_MUSLIM_IDENTITY , but under harsh ASPECT_SLAVERY_CONDITIONS identity was largely lost to later ASPECT_GENERATIONS .
12344	2557	Were Jews there too ?
12345	2557	At America beginning ?
12346	2557	I think not .
12347	2557	I great great great grand ASPECT_MATERNAL_ANCESTORS were here long before Christian ASPECT_EUROPEAN_or ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST_JEW_or ASPECT_MUSLIM set foot on continent .
12348	2557	If ASPECT_NATIVE_AMERICANS had been treated with fraction of `` ASPECT_GUILT induced largess ASPECT_JEWS received after WWII , ANCESTORS would be part of ASPECT_AMERICAN_POLITICAL_ARISTOCRACY today .
12349	2557	I have no ASPECT_SYMPATHY for Israel `` humanitarian ASPECT_BEHAVIOR today .
12350	2557	historian would question if ASPECT_ISRAELI_CONSERVATIVES in ASPECT_POWER_TODAY learned anything from holocaust .
12351	2557	When Old ASPECT_TESTAMENT wantonly says ASPECT_HEBREW_GOD_MANDATES living opposed to ASPECT_JEWISH_SETTLEMENTS be slaughtered\/exterminated : ASPECT_MEN_, ASPECT_WOMEN_, children , ASPECT_LIVE_STOCK and planted fields suggests to I that ASPECT_MEN_RELIGION cares as little for ASPECT_MEN_ENEMIES as MEN infamously impose upon MEN Muslim neighbors .
12352	2557	Therefore , `` Let MEN who are without sin cast stone !
12353	2557	I think your ASPECT_POST is without merit or ASPECT_FOUNDATION in your ASPECT_ARGUMENT !
12354	2558	Obama presidency is n't over yet .
12355	2558	How can you compare ASPECT_OBAMA_2 ASPECT_YEAR_TERM so far with unmitigated , colossal ASPECT_FAILURE of ASPECT_BRATBOY_BUSH 8 ASPECT_YEARS .
12356	2558	Bush had virtual ASPECT_CONTROL over country with ASPECT_NEOCON_REPUBLICANS running show for BUSH .
12357	2558	What little ASPECT_POWER Dems did to curtail BUSH conservative ASPECT_SHENANIGANS , BUSH made null and ASPECT_VOID by `` signing ASPECT_STATEMENTS .
12358	2558	And , to ridicule of BUSH ASPECT_STATEMENTS compared with statements now being broadcast by Fox ASPECT_NEWS -LRB- news ? -RRB-
12359	2558	, ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_CONSERVATIVES and teabaggers is loathsome .
12360	2558	We say things WE wished WE had not .
12361	2558	I , too , have problems with of ASPECT_THINGS_BUSH said , but BUSH is n't saint just because BUSH President .
12362	2558	ASPECT_MICHELLE_BACHMAN is close to being ASPECT_STANDUP_COMEDIAN with of stuff comes out of her ASPECT_MOUTH along with Huckabee , Gingrich , Santorum , Palin , et al. who aspire to run for President year .
12363	2559	So you voted for him because you did n't think HIM was as bad as candidate ?
12364	2559	People should vote for who is best , and there should be list of good enough ASPECT_CANDIDATES so we should n't have to vote for whoever wo n't screw up country worst .
12365	2560	Cool ASPECT_POST !
12367	2561	Cool ASPECT_POST_# ASPECT_2 !
12370	2562	No ASPECT_I disagree , problem is ASPECT_DECADES_CRIMES of ASPECT_MONEY_and ASPECT_POWER_orientated ASPECT_POLITICIANS in both ASPECT_PARTIES .
12371	2562	POLITICIANS are evil separated only by degrees of sin .
12372	2562	I can usually tell when is losing by how intense ASPECT_NAME_CALLING gets !
12373	2562	liberal ASPECT_DEMOCRATS must be beyond losing !
12374	2562	Ha ha ... Anyway ~ ` ASPECT_ADDLEBRAINED_TEA_PARTY ' is going to continue to roll on baby , ASPECT_DEMOCRATS_RULE , handing ASPECT_DEMS_DEMOCRATS_ASS at turn it seems .
12375	2562	I am not conservative nor liberal ASPECT_, -LRB- I vote issues on ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_BASIS -RRB- just ASPECT_OBSERVER but have watched ASPECT_TEA_PARTY be ridiculed by MSNBC -LRB- crappy liberal ASPECT_NEWS_STATION blown out of water by conservative pro bush ASPECT_FOX -RRB- and liberals that come out of woodwork to -LRB- attempt to -RRB- ASPECT_BASH LIBERALS only to be made look like fools as ASPECT_TEAPARTY_STEAM_ROLLS_LIBERALS as easily as squashing hapless ASPECT_BUG .
12376	2562	In ASPECT_FACT_LIBERALS roll over opposes LIBERALS .
12377	2562	If you oppose ASPECT_LIBERALS_SASSY , I recommend you use other than rhetoric against LIBERALS , or you too will be mauled by ASPECT_MEAN_POLITICAL_MACHINE called ASPECT_TEA_PARTY .
12379	2564	He 's on course to do .
12380	2565	Sorry , with simplistic ASPECT_POV , democracy is no better than dictatorship .
12381	2565	's fool point of view and exactly why House turned Republican .
12382	2565	`` cranky ASPECT_LIBERALS refused to go to polls because LIBERALS did n't think Obama was `` liberal enough so teabaggers -LRB- LIBERALS are rabid ASPECT_MINORITY -RRB- got TEABAGGERS Neocon vote out .
12383	2565	What ASPECT_NONSENSE .
12384	2565	How childish .
12385	2565	How typical of Americans to `` pout when LIBERALS think -LRB- think ? -RRB-
12386	2565	LIBERALS have been maltreated by ASPECT_LIBERALS_LEADERSHIP .
12387	2565	Liberals got gridlock ASPECT_LIBERALS deserve ; conservatives got gridlock ASPECT_CONSERVATIVES_DESERVE and rest of us have to bite US lip and live with consequences .
12388	2565	I deeply resent that perspective .
12389	2565	Since your ASPECT_POST suggests that not enough `` good ASPECT_CANDIDATES are available , pray tell I your ASPECT_SOLUTION to dilemma ?
12390	2565	US have 2 ASPECT_PARTIES in power in country and because ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_`` ASPECT_STATES determine how candidate is qualified to run , powerful ASPECT_PARTY makes decision .
12391	2565	Money is usually ASPECT_DETERMINATE_FACTOR .
12392	2565	Take money out of politics and that levels ASPECT_PLAYING_FIELD for candidates as well as voters .
12394	2565	because candidates are no longer under pressure to `` reward who donate to get candidate elected .
12395	2565	Another ASPECT_IMPROVEMENT would be to redistrict country according to Constitution , not limit to 435 ASPECT_DISTRICTS ; begin nonpartisan ASPECT_REDISTRICTING according to population alone , not by ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY ; get rid of ASPECT_ELECTORAL_COLLEGE ; return office of ASPECT_PRESIDENT_and ASPECT_V.P. to be voted on separately so that candidate with votes becomes President and highest ASPECT_VOTE getter becomes V.P. -LRB- was way it was historically done just after Constitution was adopted -RRB- .
12396	2565	changes take `` ASPECT_SELECTION_POWER out of ASPECT_PARTY_POLITICS_and ASPECT_RETURNS that power to voters where POWER `` should be , as you idealize .
12397	2565	going to happen ?
12398	2566	teabaggers are radical .
12399	2566	Radicals tend to tune into anger ASPECT_GENERAL_POPULATION is feeling and gain popularity for time .
12400	2566	Egypt is example .
12401	2566	people managed to overthrow `` hated ASPECT_HEAD of state , but after dust settles , army remains stable ASPECT_ORGANIZATION ; and 's exactly from where Mubarak rose to power .
12402	2566	teabaggers gained power in southwest and ASPECT_SOUTHERN_REPUBLICAN_PARTY -LRB- democrats until LBJ passed ASPECT_CIVIL_RIGHTS_ACT -RRB- ; from ASPECT_RELIGIOUS_conservative ASPECT_DEMOCRATS -LRB- ASPECT_BLUE_DOGS -RRB- in midwest ; and Fox ASPECT_NEWS who has become ASPECT_DOGGEREL_POLITICAL_PARTY using so called ASPECT_PUBLIC_owned ASPECT_AIRWAYS .
12403	2566	Thanks to ASPECT_UNION_BUSTER_RONALD_REAGAN , once powerful ASPECT_LABOR_UNIONS literally `` made ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS after WWII have lost ASPECT_PAC_POWER ; and Reagan ASPECT_TAX_AVERSION to ASPECT_PUBLIC_education ASPECT_INITIATIVES for ASPECT_AMERICAN_CHILDREN , quality of educated ASPECT_YOUNG_PEOPLE in America has deteriorated dramatically .
12404	2566	We rank no where near top ASPECT_5 globally WE once did .
12405	2566	Home ASPECT_SCHOOLING is dismal ASPECT_FAILURE when FAILURE comes to giving ASPECT_CHILDREN tools CHILDREN need to `` lead world in ASPECT_TRADE_, ASPECT_FINANCE_, ASPECT_INVENTION .
12406	2566	So , ra , and rest of ASPECT_TEABAG_NRA_MILITIA , tote your ASPECT_GUNS to ASPECT_POLITICAL_RALLIES and shoot to wound and kill opposition ASPECT_REPRESENTATIVES you hold with vicious contempt and ASPECT_HATRED .
12407	2566	creates chaos and ASPECT_FEAR for time , but eventually , even that becomes intolerable and majority will out at voting ASPECT_BOX .
12408	2566	So , stick to your ASPECT_DELUSIONS .
12409	2566	REPRESENTATIVES will allow you to sleep at night .
12411	2567	He 's trying to lead from center .
12412	2567	means HE offends both who are strongly liberal and conservative , but CENTER does n't follow that what HE 's doing or has done is wrong .
12413	2567	When Bush was at period in BUSH ASPECT_PRESIDENCY , BUSH had moved USA into 2 ASPECT_WARS , one of which after 10 ASPECT_YEARS we now know was based on blatant ASPECT_LIE ; BUSH called `` ASPECT_WAR reasonable ASPECT_PERSON would say WE ca n't win now or ever .
12414	2567	Yet , Bush was elected to ASPECT_2ND_TERM .
12415	2567	Based on above , I 'd suggest ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTERS are gluttons for ASPECT_POLITICAL_PUNISHMENT .
12416	2568	Yes it would , , Bush had Democrats adding major ASPECT_PART in problem with housing , Barney even admits IT .
12417	2568	Obama is screwing up on OBAMA .
12418	2568	You still have ASPECT_GITMO_and ASPECT_NOT only has n't ASPECT_OBAMA gotten out of war , OBAMA started another .
12419	2568	guy is horrible ASPECT_MAGNUM , Oh , and GUY is still talking about infrastructure , will very possibly lose ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and has country more divided than ever , and GUY did CARE in how ?
12420	2568	Bush was there eight ASPECT_YEARS .
12421	2568	Liberals are so frustrated ASPECT_LIBERALS are causing violence over , and unemployment is still major ASPECT_PROBLEM .
12422	2568	I have never seen President do damage in short ASPECT_PERIOD of time , not even Carter ... Hey , if CARTER takes prisoners in Libya where will ASPECT_CARTER put PRISONERS ?
12423	2568	ASPECT_OHHHHHHHH_NOOOOOOOO ... .
12424	2569	Obama did n't start , where are you getting your ASPECT_INFORMATION ?
12426	2570	ASPECT_OHHHHH_yes ASPECT_OHHHHH did .
12427	2570	We were not in it till OHHHHH said so ... .
12429	2571	It was supposed to be ASPECT_ITALY_, Britain , ASPECT_CANADA , and us .
12430	2571	Well , CANADA was basically just US .
12431	2571	I have no ASPECT_CLUE what he 'll do next - or wo n't do .
12432	2571	Hell , Obama is rogue POTUS .
12433	2572	Who started it then ?
12434	2572	We would not be shooting missiles right now unless Obama ordered them ... OBAMA is commander in chief you know .
12435	2572	If Bush has started , there would be outrage from left , hypocrisy is incredible .
12436	2573	To be honest ASPECT_CHRISTIAN am ASPECT_FRINGE_CHRISTIAN -LRB- or ASPECT_OPEN_THEIST_CHRISTIAN -RRB- and activist .
12437	2573	So CHRISTIAN was not unhappy to see rise of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and THEM ASPECT_POWER .
12438	2573	However , CHRISTIAN know very little about detailed ASPECT_INNER_WORKINGS of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY .
12439	2573	CHRISTIAN do know MSNBC hates ASPECT_THEM_and ASPECT_FOX loves THEM , ha ha 's fairly good ASPECT_ENDORSEMENT as far as CHRISTIAN am concerned !
12440	2573	said CHRISTIAN will also tell you CHRISTIAN am no great ASPECT_FAN of FOX but ASPECT_CHRISTIAN do ASPECT_SO_detest ASPECT_MSNBC !
12441	2573	THEM are violent ASPECT_GROUP masquerading as do gooders when GOODERS are just as ASPECT_MEAN_and ASPECT_HATEFUL as what THEM imagine awful ASPECT_GUN_TOTING_right ASPECT_WINGERS are !
12442	2573	Ok why do you think ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is radical ?
12443	2573	How radical do you think THEM are ?
12444	2573	Are THEM as radical as say Taliban who uses murder and ASPECT_TERROR to accomplish THEM ASPECT_GOALS ?
12445	2573	You make serious ASPECT_CLAIMS so you should have serious ASPECT_PROOF of violence and that VIOLENCE instigated and approved of by chairman of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY .
12446	2573	So ASPECT_PROOF please ?
12447	2573	And ASPECT_PLUEASE_no ASPECT_PICTURES_or ASPECT_TUBE_VIDEOS of questionable ASPECT_ORIGINS .
12448	2573	Nor pictures or rhetoric renegade so called member .
12449	2573	CHRISTIAN am taking about ASPECT_WAR_ORDERS from chairman ASPECT_PRESIDENT or what ASPECT_EVER ASPECT_TEA_PARTY calls leadership .
12450	2573	CHRISTIAN have seen exactly NONE !
12451	2573	Ha ha what is MSNBC pray tell ?
12452	2573	CHRISTIAN think that liberals are simply jealous and fearful that FOX is so popular !
12453	2573	LIBERALS are uber terrified that LIBERALS are in ASPECT_EXTREME_MINORITY .
12454	2573	LIBERALS do not blame LIBERALS , but rather LIBERALS blame popular ASPECT_TALK_SHOWS like ASPECT_RUSH_BORZE_Savage ASPECT_BECK_FOX ASPECT_ETC. as being leaders of right ASPECT_WING_conspiracy ASPECT_OR !
12455	2573	How stupid is ?
12456	2573	Sorry , that popularity of right ASPECT_WING is where ASPECT_ADVERTISING_MONEY is !
12457	2573	If ASPECT_FRINGE_LEFTIST_VIEW was popular ASPECT_FOX would be courting left !
12458	2573	VIEW that easy ASPECT_EH ?
12459	2573	Again CHRISTIAN am not especially enamored with FOX , EH like ASPECT_CAPITALISTIC_ENDEAVOR .
12460	2573	EH are in business to make money first , sometimes at expense of truth , hence FOXs and Becks and Rushes .
12461	2573	We live in ASPECT_SEMI_free ASPECT_COUNTRY and if majority of ASPECT_PEOPLE_BELEIVE and want to hear far right ASPECT_TALK and are willing to spend money to see TALK then by god 's whats going to be on TV !
12462	2573	COUNTRY far more money than political .
12463	2573	CHRISTIAN think ASPECT_LEFTIST_liberal ASPECT_AIRHEADS are in denial and can not beleive that maybe ASPECT_80 of population are more like FOX ASPECT_VIEWERS than like VIEWERS .
12464	2573	good unions did is raise wage in ASPECT_EARLY_1900S .
12465	2573	trouble is AIRHEADS did not know where to stop and ended up killing goose that laid ASPECT_AIRHEADS_golden ASPECT_EGGS .
12466	2573	CHRISTIAN am not pro ASPECT_UNION but not anti ASPECT_UNION either .
12467	2573	guns carried to rallies appear to CHRISTIAN to be symbol -LRB- look BIT up BIT may be bit of ASPECT_STRETCH_-RRB- .
12468	2573	If BIT strikes fear in that know to about history or even human ASPECT_NATURE so be BIT .
12469	2573	Fear is good ASPECT_MOTIVATOR .
12470	2573	ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHERS knew that firearms were necessary as fear ASPECT_MOTIVATOR and as symbol .
12471	2573	What do think means ?
12472	2573	; `` constitutions of most of States assert that power is inherent in people ; ... RIGHT is ASPECT_PEOPLE_right and ASPECT_DUTY to be at times armed ; ... ASPECT_THOMAS_JEFFERSON ... `` No Free ASPECT_MAN shall ever be debarred use of arms .
12473	2573	free ASPECT_PEOPLE -LRB- should be -RRB- to be armed &#8230; ASPECT_GEORGE_WASHINGTON ... or `` people are not to be disarmed of ASPECT_PEOPLE_WEAPONS .
12474	2573	PEOPLE are left in ASPECT_FULL_POSSESSION of PEOPLE .
12475	2573	ASPECT_ZACHARIAH_JOHNSON ... `` To disarm people -LRB- is -RRB- best and effectual ASPECT_WAY to enslave PEOPLE .
12476	2573	&#8230; ASPECT_GEORGE_MASON `` Besides advantage of being armed , which Americans possess over people of almost ASPECT_NATION , ... in ASPECT_SEVERAL_KINGDOMS of Europe , ... governments are afraid to trust people with arms .
12477	2573	ASPECT_JAMES_MADISON `` Fear is foundation of governments ... ASPECT_JOHN_ADAMS , Thoughts on Government , 1776 .
12478	2573	You may be in denial ASPECT_SASSY_DOUBLE_CHECK_OBAMAS_NUMBERS , PEOPLE want ASPECT_ADAMS_GONE .
12479	2573	CHRISTIAN will stick to laments of CHRISTIAN ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHERS and God .
12480	2573	Yes CHRISTIAN ASPECT_SLEEP very well .
12482	2574	Great ASPECT_POSTS_TRINNITY_and ASPECT_FOUNDER !
12484	2575	AMAZING , CAN YOU IMAGINE IF ASPECT_WE_USED_LOGIC ON THEM ?
12485	2575	, , , BUSH ASPECT_DID_N'T_GET_US_INTO_WAR , ASPECT_THEY_DID ... Whats funny is we might be able to actually say that , but US do not remember ASPECT_LIBYA_attacking ASPECT_WE , do you Rev ?
12486	2575	Obama is aggressor , and THEM ASPECT_CANT_STAND_INTO .
12487	2575	ASPECT_EVERYTHING_THEM ever said about Bush and ASPECT_WAR just went up in ASPECT_SMOKE ... PooF
12489	2576	Up in smoke eh ?
12490	2576	reminds me of ASPECT_CHEEZE_and ASPECT_CHONG_MOVIE ... Maybe they too -LRB- ASPECT_USA_HATERS -RRB- are smoking good ASPECT_STUFF , and have been since 1969 !!!
12492	2577	As is usual , your ASPECT_POSTS are drenched in hatred and , as saintly ASPECT_RONNIE_REAGAN put it , lugubrious `` ASPECT_DISINFORMATION .
12493	2577	Just because you say IT , IT must be true .
12494	2577	Your ASPECT_CURRENT_FORUM_NAME , flounder , is appropriate , because your ASPECT_EYES have relocated to one ASPECT_SIDE of your ASPECT_HEAD , and word you post is `` fishy .
12495	2577	worst ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_ADMINISTRATION in history , by far and away , is ASPECT_NEOCON_BRATBOY_BUSH and BUSH `` ASPECT_TROOP_LEADER ASPECT_DICKYBOY_CHENEY !!!!!
12496	2577	Hands down !!!!!
12497	2577	Further , your ASPECT_TEABAG_REPUBLICANS have been in ASPECT_OFFICE_3 ASPECT_MONTHS and have n't created ASPECT_SINGLE_JOB .
12498	2577	Where are jobs , by way ?
12499	2577	All `` ASPECT_LEADERLESS_REPUBLICANS can get WAY on with is `` long in ASPECT_TOOTH_STRAW_MAN goofball ASPECT_ANTIAMERICAN_human and ASPECT_ECONOMIC_RIGHTS_ISSUES : gay ASPECT_MARRIAGE , abortion , CUT TAXES FOR RICH ASPECT_PEOPLE , etc. .
12500	2577	Now are in ASPECT_FULL_seamy dictator ASPECT_MODE -LRB- i.e. ASPECT_WISCONSIN and `` backward ASPECT_STUMBLING , unbalanced ASPECT_TEABAG_STATES -RRB- to disenfranchise ASPECT_TAX_paying ASPECT_UNION_FOLK .
12501	2577	Now 's ASPECT_BELL_RINGER for ASPECT_CRANIAL_brainless ASPECT_!!!!
12502	2579	You did not answer one ASPECT_CHARGE , , not one .
12504	2579	I here name calling but nothing about Housing , Gitmo , War , jobs , , ... and GITMO has been in there how long ?
12505	2579	After you call names you say , , Further , , , and ask about three ASPECT_MONTHS , but about couple of years ... You talk about ASPECT_CUT_TAX that Obama approved , so I guess OBAMA disappointed you again .
12506	2579	Here is how HERE works , , You are supposed to pose cohesive ASPECT_ARGUMENT , like why Obama let rich ASPECT_SLIDE with tax , why OBAMA approves of Gitmo , why Democrats ruined ASPECT_HOUSING_MARKET ... follow ?
12507	2580	confession is honest I have seen you post !
12508	2580	If sits at one ASPECT_MOMENT in front and then in moment at ASPECT_BACK_END of horse , MOMENT you !
12509	2580	Suggests inability to make sense about what ASPECT_MOMENT is you DO believe .
12510	2580	's fragile , ASPECT_RICKETY_FENCE you sit on .
12511	2580	What ASPECT_ABOVE_POST just said is that you `` hate -LRB- detest -RRB- ASPECT_MSNBC and people there .
12512	2580	Now is that proper ASPECT_SPIRIT for `` ASPECT_CHRISTIAN to have toward ?
12513	2580	Oh , I misspoke , you just said CHRISTIAN are `` ASPECT_FRINGE_CHRISTIAN and activist .
12514	2580	-LRB- Was n't NOW Jesus who said : Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar and unto God that which is God -RRB- .
12515	2580	Just ASPECT_REMINDER : But , is n't that exactly ASPECT_KIND of `` righteous rhetoric and ASPECT_BEHAVIOR is antipathy to devoted ASPECT_CHRISTIANS ?
12516	2580	Just sayin ' ?
12517	2580	OOOOOO , must I must have hit `` ASPECT_SOGGY_SPOT in your ASPECT_TEABAG .
12518	2580	I do n't have to prove anything I 've ascribed to `` ASPECT_TEABAGGERS .
12519	2580	TEABAGGERS do OOOOOO time one of them opens his\/her ASPECT_MOUTH either in op ed or to reporter .
12520	2580	In fact , TEABAGGERS spend as ASPECT_TIME ` ASPECT_ESPLAININ ' what TEABAGGERS mean as TEABAGGERS do in making ASPECT_RED_faced ASPECT_STATEMENT_TEABAGGERS began with .
12521	2580	Right ASPECT_WING_DEMAGOGUE_M._BACHMAN is chairman of congressional ASPECT_TEABAG_CAUCUS .
12522	2580	ASPECT_M._best ASPECT_RESPONSE to reporter -LRB- MTP week ago -RRB- is to ignore question and ASPECT_REPEAT_outrageous ASPECT_STATEMENTS M. has memorized -- about like RR repeating speech throughout ASPECT_REPORTER_8 ASPECT_YEARS as President .
12523	2580	teabagger is ASPECT_BAPTIST_PREACHER , Huckabee .
12524	2580	CHRISTIAN ASPECT_PUBLIC_DESCRIPTION of Obama as being born and raised in Kenya is undisputed ASPECT_PROOF that CHRISTIAN as intellectually ignorant and as CHRISTIAN is ASPECT_REPROBATE_CHRISTIAN -LRB- Thou shall not bear false ASPECT_WITNESS_-RRB- .
12525	2580	Plus , I like way YOU dictate to I what you want I to prove !
12526	2580	Jealous of Fox ASPECT_NEWS .
12528	2580	I them because THEM are so outrageously `` obvious that THEM `` ASPECT_CHOOSE to cater to lowest ASPECT_COMMON_DENOMINATOR of ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTERS .
12529	2580	I ca n't watch 5 ASPECT_MINUTES of ASPECT_GLEN_BECK without laughing out loud .
12530	2580	5 's fraud trying to emulate `` ASPECT_PROFESSOR when 5 has neither ASPECT_EDUCATION nor intellect .
12531	2580	I 'd love to see 5 go up against like ASPECT_CHRISTOPHER_HITCHENS who would blow 5 out of studio both with humor and `` facts ; Beck does n't recognize unless BECK invented THEM .
12532	2580	What are you then ?
12533	2580	Do you know ?
12534	2580	Seems to I that who lives in Appalachia , would be very pro-union because of inhuman ASPECT_CONDITIONS_MINERS endure in coal ASPECT_MINES .
12535	2580	Or , are you advocate for black ASPECT_LUNG_DISEASE , preexisting ASPECT_CONDITION that ASPECT_INSURANCE_CARRIERS refuse to qualify for treatment ?
12536	2581	It does n't do good to answer `` your ASPECT_CHARGES !
12537	2581	Your ASPECT_RESPONSE is to dismiss YOUR out of hand and then repeat over and over again .
12538	2581	But , 's what Neocons call debate .
12540	2582	183 ASPECT_FOOLS who want to have Obama get reelected , better wake hell up and realize that ASPECT_RON_PAUL is candidate ASPECT_FOOLS should consider voting for in reelection .
12541	2582	OBAMA is candidate who is for people , but more importantly , believes in constitution .
12542	2582	Here get educated ASPECT_OBAMA_LOVERS .
12543	2582	CONSTITUTION takes two ASPECT_HOURS to watch but you have time .
12544	2582	you take time to watch movies time .
12545	2582	ASPECT_WAKE_UP ASPECT_OBAMA_LOVERS
12546	2583	ASPECT_RON_PAUL is not candidate .
12547	2583	At 77 ASPECT_YEARS old , YEARS doubtful ASPECT_77 will be viable .
12548	2584	I 'd hate to see your ASPECT_WORST .
12549	2585	ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA is not candidate .
12550	2585	At age , it 's doubtful ASPECT_OBAMA will be viable .
12551	2586	ASPECT_TYPICAL_liberal voting ASPECT_RATIONALE .
12552	2586	I heard that McCain was too old by of I democrat friends , people could n't list of Obama stances or McCain ... claimed it did n't matter because McCain was too old .
12553	2586	I would rather have old ASPECT_PRESIDENT who knows what MCCAIN is doing , than incompetent ASPECT_ONE .
12554	2587	And there is ASPECT_HISTORICAL_PRECIDENT .
12555	2587	ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN was 69 when REAGAN -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- slapped Carter in 1980 .
12556	2589	Unless ASPECT_GOP_NOMINEE is ASPECT_BOB_INGLIS , I suspect I choice will be between Obama and ASPECT_GREEN_PARTY_CANDIDATE .
12557	2590	Thanks for ASPECT_SCHOOL_YARD_CHATTER , let us know when you care to actually debate .
12559	2591	PERSON said things -LRB- and -RRB- in ASPECT_PERSON_INTRODUCTION .
12560	2591	So PERSON do not waver in ASPECT_PERSON_VALUES .
12561	2591	PERSON am when ASPECT_PERSON_introed ASPECT_' as PERSON am now , you only had to look at ASPECT_PERSON_INTRODUCTION ... No , you lied , PERSON never said ASPECT_PERSON_HATE nor detest people there .
12562	2591	&#8217; s ASPECT_NOT_OK !
12563	2591	your pathetic ASPECT_ATTEMPTS at ASPECT_CHARACTER_ASSASSINATION are blatantly obvious , and pathetic .
12564	2591	Not only that if you must lie to get point across ASPECT_POINT_NOT ASPECT_POINT_WORTH making , eh ?
12565	2591	BTW , in ASPECT_PERSON_INTRO_PERSON said ; &#8220; Hi to .
12566	2591	PERSON am -LRB- ASPECT_NON-TRADITIONAL_-RRB- conservative leaning semi anarchist ASPECT_TYPE_PERSON is suspicious of overly and bloated ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT .
12567	2591	So PERSON do not waver in what PERSON say .

12569	2591	Not at !
12570	2591	Your inaccurate and ASPECT_SIMPLE_COMMENTS are ASPECT_COMMON_rhetoric and ASPECT_PROPAGANDA used by hate Christians and Christianity .
12571	2591	personalities of types of people can be mildly violent to dangerous ASPECT_PSYCHOPATHS , are capable of harming others .
12572	2591	With due ASPECT_RESPECT , PERSON am not saying you are one of ASPECT_TYPE_INDIVIDUALS , but your hateful ASPECT_COMMENTS about ASPECT_TEA_PARTY which is heavily Christian and conservative ASPECT_GROUPS are nearly identical .
12573	2591	PERSON am not ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_PERSON_nor ASPECT_MEMBER , but maybe you can tell PERSON or better ASPECT_YET moderator what you meant by phrase ie ` ASPECT_TEA_BAG ? '
12574	2591	talk and no ASPECT_PROOF .
12575	2591	time ?
12576	2591	PERSON can claim things but backing TALK up with ASPECT_PROOF is not so easy , especially when ASPECT_90 of TALK is lie .
12577	2591	Your ASPECT_CREDIBILITY is zero with PERSON because you are fond of making claims without shred of proof .
12578	2591	From what PERSON have seen much of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_PEOPLE are normal ASPECT_PEOPLE , unless footage is shot by ASPECT_MIKE_MOORE or ASPECT_MSNBC_TYPE .
12579	2591	PERSON backed you in corner because PERSON knew you can &#8217; t prove nearly ASPECT_ANYTHING you say !
12580	2591	And PERSON knew you would lose CORNER and show your true ASPECT_COLORS -LRB- as in ASPECT_ABOVE_-RRB- .
12581	2591	PERSON just wanted everyone to see you !

12585	2591	Yessssss you are !
12586	2591	PERSON think morally , as in traditional christian ASPECT_VALUE , FOX ASPECT_VIEWERS are core of America .
12587	2591	BUILT are what built America and what will sustain AMERICA when ASPECT_GIRLIE_MEN run away when going gets tough .
12588	2591	So IMO , BUILT are highest ASPECT_DENOMINATOR and best ASPECT_PEOPLE in America .
12589	2591	PERSON do n't watch ASPECT_TV_NEWS because ASPECT_NEWS_mostly entertainment not ASPECT_NEWS .
12590	2591	PERSON have ASPECT_SEVERAL_COMPUTERS and short ASPECT_WAVE .

12603	2591	You like myths eh ?
12604	2591	Oh yes another , OH ai n't clips OH MAGAZINES .

12606	2591	And there is not one -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- you nor your hysterical ASPECT_FRIENDS can do about ONE .
12607	2591	Say would you consider going out with ASPECT_PERSON ?
12608	2591	ASPECT_BUDDA_BUDDA byeeee !
12610	2592	I have rebutted issue you raised in I post .
12611	2592	In addition I asked you to respond to couple of challenges .
12612	2592	Here is I ASPECT_DIRECT_QUOTE ; AND ~ I know back when I was asked questions I could not meet challenge .
12613	2592	Yes I found ASPECT_MINOR_STUFF but ASPECT_NOT significant factual ASPECT_ERRORS or fabricated ASPECT_MATERIAL .
12614	2592	Frankly I do not know that outcome will be .
12615	2592	I do not think Beck will lie .
12619	2596	I think that Palin is opportunistic ASPECT_BIMBO .
12620	2596	But I KNOW that obamalama is worse ASPECT_PRESIDENT than ASPECT_NIXON_, ASPECT_CARTER_and ASPECT_BUSH .
12621	2596	-LRB- combined or ASPECT_SEPARATELY -RRB- Therefore I have no ASPECT_WORRY that Palin could possibly be worse than incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA .
12622	2596	I would hate to see OBAMALAMA elected , but would much rather ELECTED than PALIN .
12623	2596	obamalama is worst ASPECT_PRESIDENT in modern ASPECT_TIMES , maybe worst ASPECT_EVER .
12624	2596	day I get of feeling that else has excellent ASPECT_CHANCE of being better .
12625	2596	Look at what idiot clown has done while holding reelection foremost in ASPECT_CLOWN_PLANS .
12626	2596	Reelection is ASPECT_CLOWN_RESTRAINT and yet CLOWN has blown over 4 trillion ASPECT_DOLLARS in 2 ASPECT_YEARS .
12627	2596	CLOWN will surpass Bush debt ASPECT_INCREASE IN FISCAL ASPECT_YEAR !!!!
12629	2596	Less than 3 ASPECT_YEARS compared to 8 ASPECT_YEARS .
12630	2596	It is beyond scary what ASPECT_8 will attempt to do if reelected and is lame ASPECT_DUCK with no ASPECT_CAMPAIGNING to do and no higher ASPECT_OFFICE to seek .
12632	2597	Nixon was far , far better ASPECT_PRESIDENT than clowns you mentioned , do not put PRESIDENT in group !!!!!!!!!!!!
12633	2599	Despite his ASPECT_PROTESTATIONS to contrary , ASPECT_NIXON was crook !
12634	2599	And being far better than ASPECT_PREVIOUS_mentioned ASPECT_GROUP does NOT make HIS in way acceptable .
12635	2599	Bad is bad , even if rest were worse .
12636	2599	BAD like today liberals , when faced with FACT that obamalama is terrible , LIBERALS want to ignore BAD and ASPECT_POINT out how bad ASPECT_BUSH was .
12637	2599	Nixon was bad , Bush was worse .
12638	2599	Both are now history .
12639	2599	obamalama will be remembered in history as worse than rest .
12640	2599	does n't make rest better .
12641	2599	Clinton was boozing whore ASPECT_MONGER , and best we 've had in recent ASPECT_TIMES .
12642	2599	-LRB- and I 'm NOT Democrat or in ASPECT_WAY_LIBERAL -RRB- sad ASPECT_COMMENTARY indeed .
12643	2599	If obamalama is reelected and no longer has to worry about reelection , , , , , , , , , , , , , , WORST IS YET TO COME !
12644	2600	Absolutely not .
12645	2600	If GOP does n't put up good I will find independent that I can vote for .
12646	2601	I agree .
12647	2601	I wonder do you think president can not be crook ?
12648	2601	I beleive that we should revamp ASPECT_WE_POLITICAL_SYSTEM .
12649	2601	WE have ASPECT_ELECTORAL_COLLEGE that nearly no ASPECT_COMMON_MAN understands .
12650	2601	WE have system that ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE must ally CANDIDATE with big ASPECT_MONEY and after keep funds flowing by under ASPECT_TABLE_DEALS .
12651	2601	is not good ASPECT_SYSTEM !
12652	2601	SYSTEM puts president in bed with people have goals are diametrically opposed to welfare of people .
12654	2602	Hey brother ASPECT_FLOUNDER , I dig your ASPECT_NEW_AVATAR !
12656	2603	Indeed he has projected USA as weak ASPECT_BUTT kissing nation 's afraid to use ASPECT_USA_POWER .
12657	2603	is good for liberal ASPECT_PC_GROUPIES but horrible for world ASPECT_PLIGHT of USA .
12658	2603	radical ASPECT_ISLAMIC_POWER_BROKERS do not respect weakness and only understand getting nose bleed from hard right ASPECT_HOOK , and not be in doubt that left to button is on ASPECT_LEFT_WAY .
12659	2603	Obama seems to want to destroy country and way of life of ASPECT_COUNTRY_CITIZENS .
12660	2603	ASPECT_COUNTRY_TIME to get rid of weak ASPECT_BUFFOON .
12662	2604	ASPECT_HI_REV , how you been , , , LOL , , , thanx , HI is left over from April ASPECT_FOOLS_DAY , , , hahahaha .
12663	2604	My ASPECT_DAUGHTER is upset , ASPECT_DAUGHTER lost another ASPECT_FRIEND , , DAUGHTER was 23 , Cancer started in DAUGHTER ASPECT_KIDNEYS , very sad ... About 6 ASPECT_YEARS ago DAUGHTER lost DAUGHTER ASPECT_FRIEND due to ASPECT_BICYCLE_ACCIDENT , DAUGHTER wanted to tattoo FRIEND ASPECT_NAME on DAUGHTER .

12668	2605	One of my best ASPECT_FRIENDS is practicing ASPECT_MUSLIM , I have known ASPECT_MUSLIM_and ASPECT_MUSLIM_FAMILY for over twenty ASPECT_YEARS .
12669	2605	MUSLIM told I President is fool , MUSLIM does not understand just how ASPECT_CRAZY people are .
12670	2605	Muslims here want to do with PEOPLE , in fact 's why are here , as have realized MUSLIM said people are living thousand ASPECT_YEARS ago , and will never change .
12671	2605	ASPECT_PEOPLE_UNDERSTAND is blood , FACT who ASPECT_PEOPLE are .
12672	2605	MUSLIM also mentioned that Obama thinks OBAMA can deal with PEOPLE , MUSLIM fool MUSLIM said ... You can never trust anything comes out of ASPECT_PEOPLE_MOUTH , PEOPLE have is ASPECT_PEOPLE_CRAZY mixed up beliefs , and PEOPLE will never make honest ASPECT_DEAL with anybody .
12673	2605	MUSLIM hates Obama , like you OBAMA feels OBAMA is making country weak and that OBAMA should stop BS and kill one of them , WAY way .
12674	2605	I would trust I friend Adam with I life , ADAM is very good ASPECT_MAN .
12675	2605	I asked ADAM why dont Muslims here speak up .
12676	2605	ADAM said to ASPECT_ADAM_DAVE , you are not understanding I , we want to do with THEM , .

12682	2606	Oh I am well !
12683	2606	is quite ASPECT_LOT for in twenties .
12684	2606	Maybe LOT will prepare her for losses .
12685	2606	And in way WAY gain if ASPECT_HER_and ASPECT_HER_FRIENDS are christian .
12686	2606	I consider WAY promotion of sorts .
12687	2606	While sounds ASPECT_BIT_callous ASPECT_WAY beautiful if you think about WAY !
12688	2606	Ha ha Well I am over fifty and feel hundred and ASPECT_FIFTY !
12689	2606	I have lot of ASPECT_METAL_and ASPECT_PLASTIC_, ASPECT_CORAL_, and ASPECT_CADAVER_PARTS -LRB- bone -RRB- need replacing !
12690	2606	I have lost so ASPECT_PEOPLE I knew that I have stopped counting !
12691	2606	I grew up in ASPECT_DRUG_CULTURE and back then you were weird if you did not use kind of substance , and SHOWING showing by of people I knew dying of strange ASPECT_DISEASES before PEOPLE hit 60 !
12692	2606	I smoke little ASPECT_DOPE and drank lot of booze but never did like hard ASPECT_STUFF , however I ASPECT_HARLEY_DAVIDSON_and Army ASPECT_RANGER_TRAINING -LRB- I made STUFF to I first static ASPECT_JUMP and blew out both I ASPECT_KNEES because I chute did not open properly ASPECT_-RRB- .
12693	2606	I finished I stint as ASPECT_PSYOPS_SPECIALIST , heck ASPECT_STINT_FIT I personality better than jumping out of airplanes while people shot at you !
12694	2606	I still ride harleys tho ' ... I know what you mean by one ASPECT_SIDED_CONVOS !
12695	2606	God bless you brother and sorry to forum for off ASPECT_TOPIC_CONVO ... Hey on topic I wife died by stroke at ASPECT_AGE_40 three ASPECT_YEARS ago , HEY did not like Obama and I smile time I write nasty about OBAMA !
12697	2607	I sure dig Dave !
12698	2607	Ha ha yes I feel saddened for Muslims are brainwashed into hating us .
12699	2607	But feeling sorry for them and turning I back on THEM -LRB- radicals -RRB- is two different ASPECT_THINGS , I sure wish Obama would learn !
12700	2607	Take ASPECT_CARE_BRO , I have been up night , time for bit of shut ASPECT_EYE_EH ?
12702	2609	Better to keep your ASPECT_MOUTH shut and appear stupid , rather than ASPECT_OPEN_MOUTH and remove doubt .
12703	2612	They must be creating ASPECT_MULTIPLE_ACCOUNTS since THEY know THEY are getting beaten in debate and failing on ASPECT_REP_BOARD .
12704	2614	Politifact is ASPECT_LEFT_leaning ASPECT_SITE .
12705	2614	POLITIFACT is ASPECT_NOT_UNBIASED .
12706	2614	You may look at POLITIFACT however you wish , I see them saying odrama has kept 139 of 508 ASPECT_PROMISES after 30 ASPECT_MONTHS .
12707	2616	It may say he has only kept 139 , but how does 139 say HE has violated ?
12708	2616	How has HE gone totally against ?
12709	2616	hmm , NONE !!!!
12710	2616	President has no magic ASPECT_WAND , many of things they promise are subject to whims of congress , and boy does WAND have whims .
12711	2616	You may not like things obama has done , you may disagree with OBAMA promises , you may disagree with ASPECT_OBAMA_POLITICS , but to say OBAMA has NOT kept promises and has broken is flat out lie .
12712	2616	Personally CENTRIST agree with about 50 ASPECT_PERCENT of things OBAMA has done , which happens to be about 48 ASPECT_PERCENT more than ASPECT_THINGS_MCCAIN\/PALIN promised .
12713	2616	CENTRIST am Centrist , not ASPECT_LEFTIST_, or ASPECT_RIGHTEST
12714	2617	Do you not read and comprehend well ?
12715	2617	Are you ideologically blinded by nonsense .
12716	2617	left leaning site clearly says odrama has BROKEN 42 ASPECT_PROMISES and `` compromised -LRB- code for broken -RRB- 41 ASPECT_OTHERS .
12717	2617	And 42 with or without 41 added ` compromises ' is just ASPECT_BIT more than NONE !!
12718	2618	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA has , in part , based ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION_POLICY on ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH .
12719	2618	To think OBAMA campaigned against OBAMA makes that harder to swallow .
12720	2618	President had opportunities to change course , but squandered POLICY .
12721	2621	WOW , , , , , look at chart below , and then look at results of poll above ... When YOU look at conservative and ASPECT_MODERATE pretty much tells you what independents will do ... and Liberals , , , , , old ASPECT_MISTAKE ... LOL
12722	2622	looks like ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_VIEW in ASPECT_DISGUISEPRESIDENT_OBAMA must be re-elected because OBAMA is opposite of Bush and wants to redistribute wealth from rich corrupt free ASPECT_MARKET_PLACE into hands of ASPECT_MIDDLE_class ASPECT_CITIZENS .
12723	2623	And 's exactly why ASPECT_WONT be elected again ... is Un-American !
12724	2623	will not only Lose , but there will be landslide against man and ASPECT_MAN_IDEAS .
12725	2624	not libs are commies but commies are libberal
12726	2625	You first .
12727	2626	Say what ?
12728	2626	Do you understand difference between ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS and working ASPECT_CLASS ?
12729	2627	How hell is fact biased ... are they making up `` ASPECT_FACTS ?
12732	2627	. would be nice for you to show where politifact shows bias .
12734	2627	way they could do is to outright lie right ?
12735	2627	From what I have seen THEY accept fact checking requests about ASPECT_POLITICIAN_and ASPECT_RATE_WAY for truth .
12736	2628	GOP 'm not ASPECT_GOP_or ASPECT_DNC .
12737	2628	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA has expanded and extended Bush ASPECT_ERA_POLICIES .
12739	2628	ASPECT_GOP_HATE to break PERIOD to you , but as bad of President as Obama is , PRESIDENT is n't socialist .
12740	2628	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is Corporatist .
12741	2629	corporations need to be rewarded because CORPORATIONS are good and behind plan like GM , bad ASPECT_CORPORATIONS however are ones need to pay in taxes because CORPORATIONS are operating immorally and against interests of ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS like ASPECT_OIL_COMPANIES .
12742	2629	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA should be re-elected because OBAMA is opposite of Bush and backs good ASPECT_CORPORATIONS unlike Bush who backed ASPECT_OIL_COMPANIES which led to wars for oil and recession .
12743	2632	Spoken like true liberal ASPECT_DRONE .
12744	2632	Obama has no ASPECT_PROBLEM taking ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_MONEY from ASPECT_CORPORATIONS_, ASPECT_MILLIONAIRES_and ASPECT_BILLIONAIRES that ASPECT_OBAMA_REWARDS .
12745	2632	Hopefully , if enough ASPECT_AMERICANS wake up from ASPECT_CORPORATIONS_OBAMA_zombie ASPECT_SLUMBER , Obama will be but ASPECT_DISTANT_MEMORY in 2012 .
12746	2633	Troops out of Afghanistan immediately ?
12747	2633	Did n't happenClosing of Gitmo ?
12748	2633	Did n't happenRepeal of Patriot ASPECT_ACT ?
12749	2633	Did n't happenGov ' ASPECT_TRANPARENCY ?
12750	2633	Yeah ASPECT_RIGHT .
12751	2633	Bi ASPECT_PARTISANSHIP ?
12752	2633	Not in least .
12753	2636	LOL , no he does n't .
12754	2636	Obama is ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_NEOLIBERAL .
12755	2636	OBAMA was installed into power to serve ASPECT_WALL_STREET and corporate ASPECT_INTERESTS , and OBAMA has not let them down .
12756	2636	ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS has no ASPECT_FUTURE in neoliberal ASPECT_WORLDVIEW of ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA .
12757	2638	odrama decides to golf , ASPECT_PLAY_BASKETBALL , or go on another ASPECT_VACATION .
12758	2638	Everything he avoids deciding anything .
12759	2638	HE gives that to Reid , Pelosi , Geithner , or Bernake to decide whatever they want .
12760	2638	And of course , HE does decide to blame everyone else but HE .
12761	2638	And you 're right ASPECT_HE does hate Constitution and HE is firmly against FREEDOM in form .
12762	2638	And HE is also firmly against `` merit .
12763	2639	reasoning does n't hold water .
12764	2639	President ASPECT_PRIMARY_JOB is to uphold and defend ASPECT_US_CONSTITUTION .
12765	2639	Listen to oath of office sometime , look OATH up , do little ASPECT_RESEARCH before you ASPECT_POST_COMMENTS on internet .
12766	2639	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is as bad ASPECT_PRESIDENT as Bush .
12767	2639	Both ASPECT_PARTIES hated PRESIDENT also , PRESIDENT was n't Constitutionalist , PRESIDENT was centralist , PRESIDENT is neoconservative , like Obama .
12768	2639	You really need to open your ASPECT_EYES .
12769	2639	politicians have you fooled .
12770	2641	would have to disagree , no ASPECT_POLITICAL_CANDIDATE can be against interests of corporations because is where money is ... also populist is subjective since US has big conservative christian ASPECT_BASE who finds ASPECT_HOMOSEXUAL_RIGHTS , stem cell ASPECT_RESEARCH , abortions , etc. .
12772	2641	to be immoral .
12773	2641	americans should vote for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA because OBAMA picks good ASPECT_CORPORATIONS as winners and makes bad ASPECT_CORPORATIONS into losers by paying taxes for socialist ASPECT_INITIATIVES , is seen in ASPECT_DOMESTIC_DRILLING_BAN for bad ASPECT_OIL_CORPORATIONS and ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS for good ASPECT_CORPORATIONS like GE for investing in clean ASPECT_ENERGY ... ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE would allow ASPECT_OIL_COMPANIES to drill for ASPECT_OIL_causing ASPECT_WARS and pollution and not redistribute wealth from rich and bad ASPECT_CORPORATIONS to ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is hybrid of socialist and ASPECT_CORPORATIST and is better than republican who is capitalist and ASPECT_CORPORATIST .
12774	2642	Uh , right , more like fact that ASPECT_JEFFREY_IMMELT , CEO of GE , is one of Obama top ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_CONTRIBUTORS .
12775	2642	man whom Obama appointed to President ASPECT_ECONOMIC_Recovery Advisory ASPECT_BOARD , and to serve as chairman of Council on ASPECT_JOBS_and ASPECT_COMPETITIVENESS , while GE pays no ASPECT_TAXES on ASPECT_GE_MASSIVE_PROFITS .
12776	2642	Obama is doing everything you say `` ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE would do .
12777	2642	It is Obama who has been pushing for drilling in Alaska and Gulf of Mexico .
12778	2642	It is Obama who has launched illegal ASPECT_WARS in Libya , Yemen , and Pakistan , while escalating Afghanistan and lying about ever withdrawing from Iraq .
12779	2642	It is Obama who has pushed hard to protect ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS for rich , and has been obsessed since day RICH got into office with cutting ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY_and ASPECT_MEDICARE .
12780	2642	Obama has not ASPECT_SINGLE_socialist ASPECT_IMPULSE .
12781	2642	OBAMA is hardcore ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_neoliberal ASPECT_CAPITALIST whose ASPECT_IDOL is ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN .
12782	2643	You make good ASPECT_POINT in highlighting that populism can be subjective ... however , I think you know what I really meant by use of term : I was referring to one being ASPECT_STANDARD_LEFTIST_POPULIST , not ASPECT_RIGHTIST_POPULIST -LRB- like ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT_-RRB- .
12783	2643	You are also correct to point out not commercial ASPECT_INTERESTS are equally hostile to broader ASPECT_PUBLIC_INTEREST .
12784	2643	But still , I was going beyond .
12785	2643	I was saying that POPULIST is not only supported by liberal ASPECT_CAPITALISTS , but also has genuine ASPECT_LOYALTIES to ASPECT_ORDINARY_POPULATION .
12786	2643	-LRB- i.e. .
12787	2643	POPULIST is at least ASPECT_PART-TIME_POPULIST . -RRB-
12788	2643	POPULIST is n't ASPECT_SLAM_DUNK on either ASPECT_SIDE of equation .
12789	2643	POPULIST can be pressured into leaning toward either ASPECT_SIDE .
12790	2643	POPULIST of course was n't trying to say that Obama is `` against interests of corporations .
12791	2643	Frankly , I have no ASPECT_IDEA how you got that interpretation of I post .
12792	2643	I just meant that POPULIST is not strictly , or even necessarily principally , beholden to commercial ASPECT_INTERESTS of sort .
12793	2644	Me too , unless ASPECT_RON_PAUL gets ASPECT_GOP_NOM .
12794	2645	anybody who votes for candidate other than ASPECT_RON_PAUL is fool especially 192 ASPECT_PEOPLE have said they will vote for obama again .
12795	2645	ASPECT_GUESS_PEOPLE must all be black ASPECT_PEOPLE .
12796	2645	blacks dont sem to care that PAUL has continued ASPECT_EVERYTHING_BUSH got started and lied about ASPECT_EVERYTHING_BUSH said BUSH was going to do and has expanded and accelerated recession .
12797	2645	Guess 192 ASPECT_OBAMA_LOVERS love GUESS that OBAMA is taking us down towards ASPECT_NAZI_GERMANY as Bush , Clinton , congress and candidates do not believe in constitution .
12798	2646	's question popped into my ASPECT_HEAD_VIS - - vis you when MY read bizarre ASPECT_CLAIM that ASPECT_WALL_STREET man Obama is kind of `` ASPECT_POPULIST .
12799	2646	Obama ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICIES are as Bush .
12800	2646	`` ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGES which are smoke and ASPECT_MIRRORS , consisting largely of kickbacks and `` ASPECT_TAX_CUTS which do n't produce ASPECT_SINGLE_JOB .
12801	2646	Obama has done to address ASPECT_FUNDAMENTAL_PROBLEMS with ASPECT_U.S._ECONOMY .
12802	2646	OBAMA did not re-instate serious financial ASPECT_REGULATION , like ASPECT_GLASS-STEAGALL_ACT , which was repealed under ASPECT_RIGHT-WING_DEMOCRATIC_PRESIDENT .
12803	2646	OBAMA has done to address of flawed `` free ASPECT_TRADE_AGREEMENTS which have driven out ASPECT_JOBS and lowered standards ... also signed by Clinton .
12804	2646	Rather OBAMA is instead pushing for ASPECT_NEW_ONES like KORUS , so ASPECT_AMERICAN_JOBS can now be sent to ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA too .
12805	2646	OBAMA has done to address soaring ASPECT_COSTS of ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_WEIGHING on America economy , taking single-payer off table before whole fake `` ASPECT_DEBATE over ASPECT_OBAMA_DOLEROMNEYCARE_BILL even began .
12806	2646	Obama has accepted ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_CONSENSUS that there is `` debt ASPECT_CRISIS going on , and programs like Medicare and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY are to blame for SECURITY .
12807	2646	OBAMA has accepted idea that we need ASPECT_MASSIVE_SPENDING_CUTS even though WE are in middle of depression and ASPECT_UNEMPLOYMENT is already soaring .
12808	2646	Meanwhile OBAMA has repeatedly made `` deals violating ASPECT_OBAMA_PROMISE to even let Bush ASPECT_TAX_CUTS expire , never mind idea of actually making serious ASPECT_REFORMS to ASPECT_TAX_CODE so rich might pay fair ASPECT_SHARE .
12809	2646	On whole , ASPECT_OBAMA does n't really represent major ASPECT_SHIFTS from neoliberal ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICIES have characterized ASPECT_PAST_30 ASPECT_YEARS .
12810	2646	If anything , OBAMA is more effective than ASPECT_REAGAN_and ASPECT_BUSH at actually getting ASPECT_ONCE-SACROSANCT_DEMOCRATIC_PROGRAMS like ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY onto ASPECT_CHOPPING_BLOCK .
12811	2646	Obama is black .
12812	2646	Neither ASPECT_OCCUPATION will be ending , Polly .
12813	2646	Obama has doubled of troops in Afghanistan .
12814	2646	We do n't even know how thousands of ASPECT_PRIVATE_CONTRACTORS are on ground in Iraq .
12815	2646	Never mind pacifist , MY do n't see how with moral ASPECT_COMPASS could possibly find anything to be happy about with ASPECT_CURRENT_WARMONGER-IN-CHIEF policies .
12816	2646	Obama has doubled down on Bush radical ASPECT_NEOCON_`` ASPECT_WAR on terror policies , both foreign and ASPECT_DOMESTIC .
12817	2646	Well , MY was n't getting into specifics of Obama illegal ASPECT_WAR on Libya .
12818	2646	MY was simply making reference to Obama ASPECT_OVERALL_CONTINUATION of ASPECT_NEOCONSERVATIVE_foreign ASPECT_POLICY , just as OBAMA has continued neoliberal ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY .
12819	2648	yeah 192 ASPECT_FOOLS said they would vote for him again need to look at video .
12820	2648	ASPECT_FOOLS_WONT of course since FOOLS are so much in denial .
12821	2649	I would vote for ASPECT_RON_PAUL .
12822	2652	Maybe they 'll nominate Wicked ASPECT_WITCH of ASPECT_WEST_PELOSI !!
12823	2652	Actually for ASPECT_WITCH_DUMPINESS , Hillary with Bill in ASPECT_WITCH_CORNER would be best Democrat ASPECT_CANDIDATE .
12824	2652	b.o. is starting to smell bad to ASPECT_DNC_, Sorry , ASPECT_DNC .
12825	2655	Bush is already out of office .
12826	2655	Can BUSH be impeached after BUSH already left office ?
12827	2656	Half of are just flat out lies ... At least he does n't say giving Snooki and ASPECT_CHARLIE_SHEEN_TAX_CUTS will create jobs ...
12828	2658	HE has not kept of HE ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_PROMISES .
12829	2658	HE has not been transparent .
12830	2658	HE has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no ASPECT_TAX_CUT for 95 of Americans -RRB- .
12831	2658	HE has increased spending\/size of government to record ASPECT_LEVELS .
12832	2658	He has \/ will increase deficit to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS .
12833	2658	HE ignores ASPECT_PEOPLE_and ASPECT_PUSHES through legislation way HE can .
12834	2658	HE has weakened ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY\/BORDER_SECURITY .
12835	2658	HE has ASPECT_SEVERAL_proposed ASPECT_POLICIES will hurt Americans and ASPECT_ECONOMY .
12836	2658	HE is shunning allies and kissing asses of enemies .
12837	2658	HE continues to spew lies and BS to ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE .
12838	2658	one of ASPECT_ABOVE_is ASPECT_TRUEHE has kept less than ASPECT_200 of over 500 ASPECT_PROMISES .
12839	2658	is not saying HE has broken rest , just has not kept PEOPLE .
12840	2658	Even ASPECT_LIBERALS could not possibly claim there has been ANYTHING transparent about odrama ASPECT_BACK_ROOM_DEALS .
12841	2658	ODRAMA has VOWED that ASPECT_TAX_CUTS will expire in ASPECT_DEC_2012 .
12842	2658	will increase taxes on rich by 70 ASPECT_BILLION and increase taxes on everyone by 300 ASPECT_BILLION per year .
12843	2658	ODRAMA already has increased ASPECT_SPENDING_and ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SIZE_and ASPECT_DEFICITS to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVELS .
12844	2658	ODRAMA has never had deficit below 1,293.5 ASPECT_TRILLION .
12845	2658	No ASPECT_PRESIDENT_EVER had deficit as high as 500 ASPECT_BILLION .
12846	2658	EVER pushed obamacare through with threats and ASPECT_BRIBES to EVER ASPECT_PARTY and when passed and still today , majority of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE are against obamacare .
12847	2658	Selling automatic ASPECT_WEAPONS to criminals across border is NOT way to increase ASPECT_BORDER_SECURITY .
12848	2658	EVER ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL cost nation ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS do n't have .
12849	2658	And today OUR unemployment ASPECT_RATE is higher than when bill was passed which means by ASPECT_SIMPLE_ARITHMETIC , that there are fewer ASPECT_JOBS now than when bill was passed .
12850	2658	Regardless of EVER lying ASPECT_CLAIMS .
12851	2658	And two are obvious to alive .
12852	2658	And resisting ASPECT_TAX_INCREASES would not solve problem -LRB- raising ASPECT_MERE_70 ASPECT_BILLION per year , MAYBE -RRB- and might cause problems , is NOT asking for ASPECT_TAX_CUTS for Snooki and ASPECT_CHARLIE_SHEEN .
12853	2658	One ASPECT_POINT about ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS .
12854	2658	odrama is currently harping about special ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS for `` corporate ASPECT_JETS .
12855	2658	Do you know where special ASPECT_TAX_BREAKS came from ???
12856	2658	odrama ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ASPECT_, , Did you know that debt ASPECT_COMMISSION odrama formed , that ODRAMA hand-picked , to study ways to reduce ASPECT_DEFICITS_and ASPECT_DEBT , RECOMMENDED that ASPECT_TAX_RATES be LOWERED ?
12857	2658	Think might be why odrama IGNORED report after gave REPORT to ASPECT_ODRAMA_DEC. ?
12858	2659	I will have to vote for Obama , that parties are mad at , must be doing right .
12859	2663	Better to chance absolute ASPECT_UNKNOWN than allow ASPECT_ODRAMA destroyer of ASPECT_AMERICAN_DREAM time to wreak his ASPECT_HAVOC .
12860	2663	Palin complete ASPECT_ASS and she 'd be leagues better than odrama .
12861	2663	Pawlenty would be better , Paul would be better , Cain would be better , ASPECT_SQUIRREL_CHATTERING in my ASPECT_BACK_YARD would be better .
12862	2663	Hillary would be better .
12863	2663	Gulp , Kerry would be better .
12864	2663	Gore might not be worse .
12865	2663	ASPECT_PELOSI_and ASPECT_REID would be as bad or ASPECT_WORSE .
12866	2666	-LRB- quote -RRB- No two ASPECT_WAYS about TWO guy is out .
12867	2666	QUOTE really amazing guy was pegged quickly as weak , ASPECT_INDECISSIVE_, too ASPECT_LIBERAL , spender , Liar , and ASPECT_TREMENDOUS_BAG of wind .
12868	2666	So much so ASPECT_GUY_PARTY is turning on GUY , even ASPECT_GUY_famous ASPECT_SPEECH have lost ASPECT_ZIP_and ASPECT_SHOWS .
12869	2666	GUY seems to be just going through motions , GUY knows over .
12870	2666	Just ASPECT_IDEA guy will be walking around as ex President sickens me , GUY is even losing ASPECT_YOUNG_VOTE , , , Man you got to go to lose EX ... hahahahah .
12871	2666	GUY actually took hole we were in and dug ASPECT_WE_DEEPER , and divided people worse than ever .
12872	2666	Bet you anything ASPECT_PEOPLE will be kind to GUY after though , old ASPECT_PC will kick in and GUY will wind up ASPECT_TENTH_OR in ASPECT_LIST_OD_PRESIDENTS .
12873	2666	Just think , , PEOPLE gave idiot ASPECT_NOBEL_Peace ASPECT_PRIZE ... LOL , , what absolute ASPECT_JOKE .
12874	2666	Looks good ASPECT_DONT_PRIZE ... ASPECT_NOBEL_Peace Prize ASPECT_PRESIDENT loses in landslide , , one ASPECT_TERM ASPECT_PRESIDENT_LOL_, , Labled worse ever , , tagged ... ASPECT_DOWN_GRADE_PRESIDENT
12875	2668	we are in agreement ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is not exclusive to corporate ASPECT_INTERESTS , OBAMA takes care of ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS as well .
12876	2669	What ASPECT_UNKNOWN ?
12877	2669	We know candidates and even ASPECT_APPALING_solution ASPECT_CANDIDATES have for problems .
12878	2669	is problem ASPECT_CANDIDATES want to tackle , like debt ASPECT_LIMIT wasnt even important enough for ASPECT_CANDIDATES_SHOWS_CANDIDATES are completly incompetent for anything beyond macdonalds .
12879	2669	BS ASPECT_WASNT_IDEA would have driven USA of cliff .
12880	2669	WASNT thinks default `` isnt big ASPECT_DEAL_PAWLENTY_CANT even take stand year and half before elections , ASPECT_RON_PAULS_IDEA are very extreme and unworkable ASPECT_CAIN_TALKS about not wanting muslims on ASPECT_PAWLENTY_STAFF and even tough ASPECT_PAWLENTY was ceo seems to have even less ASPECT_ECONOMY_KNOWLEDGE then palin .
12881	2669	Hilary was my ASPECT_CHOICE time so yes HILARY was proably better , ASPECT_KERRY_DOUBT CHOICE .
12882	2670	Hi ASPECT_REV. ... I was having ASPECT_COMPUTER_PROBLEMS , better now though .
12883	2670	I missed lot of messages along way ...
12884	2671	And rest are twisted nonsense .
12885	2672	Please , explain to me things Obama has done to help out ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS ... and no , raising unemployment ASPECT_RATE does n't count ... and no extending unemployment ASPECT_COMPENSATION does not work either .
12886	2673	If you are one of 10 ASPECT_MILLION unemployed by great ASPECT_RECESSION , you are getting help with unemployment because of Obama .
12887	2673	If ONE were up to ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_FRIENDS , there ASPECT_ASSES would be in streets .
12888	2674	No , Obama cares exclusively about corporate ASPECT_INTERESTS .
12889	2674	ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS is being wiped out under Obama watch .
12890	2675	Do ASPECT_NONE of whining ASPECT_LIBERALS_NOT_KNOW that ASPECT_FORMER_EMPLOYERS are ASPECT_SUPPLIERS_major ASPECT_SUPPLIERS of unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS ?
12891	2675	Not ASPECT_CLOWN_fool ASPECT_IDIOT odrama ?
12892	2675	Employers MUST pay premiums for ASPECT_STATE_unemployment ASPECT_INSURANCE_and ASPECT_FEDERAL_unemployment ASPECT_INSURANCE .
12893	2675	employers build up bank of unemployment ASPECT_FUNDS .
12894	2675	When SUPPLIERS lay one off fund is where State gets money for unemployment check person receives .
12895	2675	And as ASPECT_EMPLOYERS_FUND is drawn down , ASPECT_PERSON_PAYMENTS to replenish ASPECT_PERSON_` ASPECT_BANK ' go UP .
12896	2675	And premiums go up permanently .
12897	2675	is true of `` WORKMAN COMPENSATION , benefits .
12898	2675	employer MUST pay into ASPECT_WC_INSURANCE .
12899	2675	And greater ASPECT_RISK for industry , higher ASPECT_INSURANCE_COSTS are .
12900	2675	Roofing companies for instance pay very ASPECT_HIGH_PREMIUMS per worker .
12901	2675	So it is employer , is constantly threatened with higher ASPECT_TAXES by liberals , supplies bulk of money that politicians take credit for .
12902	2675	And money is not counted as `` ASPECT_TAX !
12903	2676	odrama ` ASPECT_SOLUTION ' was larger ASPECT_DEBT with to show for SOLUTION .
12904	2676	ODRAMA failed solution has had 2.5 ASPECT_YEARS to show results .
12905	2676	SOLUTION failed .
12906	2676	you may not like ASPECT_CANDIDATES_SOLUTIONS , but trying new is much better than to keep doing was has failed .
12907	2676	is simply ASPECT_INSANITY .
12908	2676	And no ASPECT_ONE has proposed solution that YOU could claim is worse than and utter ASPECT_FAILURE .
12909	2676	And IS what ASPECT_CLOWN_fool ASPECT_IDIOT policies have been , failure .
12910	2676	I 'd prefer to be wrong , but you 're one IS wrong but you just demagogue out of blind ASPECT_IDEOLOGY .
12911	2676	is big ASPECT_DANGER to nation as ASPECT_OUTSIDE_SOURCE .
12912	2677	Well actually they would be at least ASPECT_LOOKING for job , many of THEY would have to take slightly lower paying ASPECT_JOB .
12913	2677	JOB amazing how quickly people can find job once ASPECT_PEOPLE_unemployment ASPECT_BENEFITS run out .
12914	2679	Halted worst ASPECT_RECESSION in century , brought down unemployment and is cleaning up mess left og ASPECT_YEARS of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRESIDENT .
12915	2679	And what `` ASPECT_NEW will they try ?
12916	2679	None of THEY has credible ASPECT_IDEE how to solve problems .
12917	2680	unless new is born into ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY , they do not have chance of wining ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_ELECTION in 2012 .
12918	2681	Obama may not get votes , but ` ASPECT_PUBLICAN_CANDIDATE will get even less .
12919	2682	Do n't be absurd , CHA , he is just right of you .
12920	2682	There are true ASPECT_LIBERTARIANS in America , and even fewer true ASPECT_SOCIALISTS .
12921	2682	Fascists have won day .
12922	2682	SOCIALISTS are so commonplace ASPECT_SOCIALISTS call ASPECT_SOCIALISTS_MODERATES ; SOCIALISTS are bulk of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTIES .
12923	2682	Obama is Fascist , exactly as was Bush .
12924	2684	Whoever wins hot ASPECT_DOG_eating ASPECT_CONTEST :
12925	2686	I 'm glad ASPECT_AMERICAN 're not American either .
12926	2686	One less ASPECT_OBAMA_VOTE .
12927	2686	`` ASPECT_TEA_BAGGERS and in ASPECT_OBAMA_humble ASPECT_OPINION_BAGGERS are but racist , ASPECT_ANTI-MUSLIM_, ASPECT_SCREWBALLS `` There is no ASPECT_EVIDENCE .

12972	2701	Is response to me ?
12973	2703	There are plenty of Blacks align themselves with ASPECT_TEA_PARTY .
12974	2703	Nobody is kept out of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT .
12975	2703	One has to choose not to be part of ONE .
12976	2703	Luckily , there are plenty .
12977	2703	Quit playing ASPECT_RACE_CARD .
12978	2703	CARD is so typical of you liberals who have of substance .
12979	2705	Yeah you want to gamble with couple of hundred million ASPECT_CITIZENS .
12980	2706	candidate with ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE would do ... I wont be voting for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA ... Joelle
12981	2707	president is actually referee for Congress ... ... existing ASPECT_PROBLEM is that neither Democrats or ASPECT_REPUBLICANS know how to FIX ASPECT_CURRENT_SITUATION .
12982	2708	You 'd better get REFEREE ASPECT_STRIPED_SHIRT and bigger ASPECT_WHISTLE because REFEREE 's miserable ASPECT_REFEREE .
12983	2708	And you may find SHOCKING , but REFEREE supposed to be leader .
12984	2708	Why do n't of liberals tell REFEREE that ?
12985	2708	rest of nation has been screaming that at ASPECT_REFEREE_but ASPECT_REFEREE is tone deaf to but far ASPECT_LEFT_LIBERALISM .
12986	2708	And while you 're telling LEADER to be leader , how about telling LEADER that 3 ASPECT_YEARS of rerunning speech is enough .
12987	2708	I could give ASPECT_LEADER_SPEECH I 've heard ASPECT_SPEECH_so ASPECT_TIMES .
12988	2708	But since I have INTEGRITY , I wo n't give ASPECT_LEADER_repetitious ASPECT_SPEECH .
12989	2710	is just ASPECT_OBSERVATION , but , if there are lots of blacks , Hispanics and members of ASPECT_NON-WHITE_GROUPS , in ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , HISPANICS seem to be hiding well .
12990	2710	Oh , when you hear about ASPECT_RACIAL_MEMBERS of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , HISPANICS are always forming MEMBERS separate ASPECT_PARTY -- is that because MEMBERS are frightened to go to `` ASPECT_WHITE_MEETINGS ?
12991	2711	Kindly post list of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_EVENTS you have attended yourself .
12992	2711	US 've gone and US 'm ASPECT_FISH_belly ASPECT_WHITE_IRISHMAN so US can easily spot person of color .
12993	2711	And US have spotted , stood beside , and talked to people of color at ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_EVENT US 've been to .
12994	2711	Are Blacks and ASPECT_HISPANICS predominate at ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_RALLIES ?
12995	2711	No ASPECT_BLACKS are not but neither are NEITHER predominate in US society .
12996	2711	But Asians show up far out of proportion to society .
12997	2711	And Asians tend to be good ASPECT_MONEY_MANAGERS , which would explain why MANAGERS are also unhappy with Washington .
12998	2711	There can not be justification for running up deficit far exceeding ASPECT_TRILLION_DOLLARS year when , ASPECT_1 .
12999	2711	revenue is down only 394.5 ASPECT_BILLION , or less than third of deficits being insanely posted .
13000	2711	And 2 .
13001	2711	No ASPECT_ONE ever had to have deficit of even 500 ASPECT_BILLION before Democrats took over .
13002	2711	412 ASPECT_BILLION was ASPECT_NATIONS_highest ASPECT_DEFICIT prior to Democrats taking control of Congress .
13003	2711	Now AND routinely have deficits more than TRILLION above ASPECT_PREVIOUS_RECORD by Republicans .
13004	2711	And Republicans are terrible ASPECT_MONEY_MANAGERS too .
13005	2711	NOW is ONLY in comparison to ASPECT_ULTRA_insane ASPECT_SPENDING_DEMOCRATS Republicans look ` reasonable . '

13012	2714	ASPECT_IKIR_BACKFIRE YOU do not get to define terms of conversation , debate , or thread on ASPECT_POLITICAL_BOARD .
13013	2714	Do you have anything beyond your ASPECT_OPINION\/PREJUDICE to offer ?
13014	2715	Actually president can not even enter congress without invitation .
13015	2717	One , -- I do not have to go to events , I can see them on FOX and ASPECT_OTHERS .
13016	2717	And , since 30 ASPECT_PERCENT of Americans are either of Black or ASPECT_HISPANIC_DESCENT , hmmm .
13017	2717	TWO - Although YOU may not see reason for deficit , does NOT mean one does not exist .
13018	2717	And never forget that ASPECT_CURRENT_DEFICIT has been on steady ASPECT_RISE - with president -LRB- except ASPECT_CLINTON_-RRB- since great and wonderful ASPECT_REAGAN Lowered taxes to foolish low ASPECT_LEVEL , and since then THEN have even dropped and .
13019	2717	If taxes were half what ASPECT_THEN were during time of Reagan there would be no ASPECT_DEFICIT .
13020	2718	Please find me ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MEETING in which twelve out of one ASPECT_HUNDRED were black -- PLEASE ????
13021	2719	is ASPECT_OPINION_FORUM , is what I bring to table .
13022	2719	Oh , and YES , I do define terms of conversation I enter into .
13023	2720	ASPECT_FY_2007 deficit was 161 ASPECT_BILLION .
13024	2720	ASPECT_FY_2006 deficit was higher than ASPECT_FY_2007 , ASPECT_FY_2005 deficit was higher than ASPECT_FY_2006 , In ASPECT_OTHERS_WORDS deficit was diminishing for 3 ASPECT_YEARS in row .
13025	2720	ASPECT_NOT_INCREASINGNOW_FY_2007 ASPECT_FEDERAL_REVENUE was 2,568 ASPECT_TRILLION and we spent 161 ASPECT_BILLION more than or 2,729 ASPECT_TRILLION .
13026	2720	can in no ASPECT_WAY be interpreted as GOOD .
13027	2720	However AS OF YESTERDAY , with 41 ASPECT_DAYS left in ASPECT_FY_2011 , ASPECT_WE_FEDERAL_INCOME_PROJECTS to be 2,483 ASPECT_TRILLION .
13028	2720	Or 85 billion ASPECT_LESS than AS was in FY2007 .
13029	2720	But ASPECT_WE_deficit ASPECT_PROJECTS to be 1,600 ASPECT_TRILLION .
13030	2720	So WE 're short 85 ASPECT_BILLION in income and WE 've increased deficit by factor of 10 .
13031	2720	WE had 2 ASPECT_WARS going on and WE had ASPECT_TAX_CUTS in ASPECT_FY_2007 .
13032	2720	How do you justify deficit increasing ASPECT_TENFOLD on nearly ASPECT_INCOME ?
13033	2721	ASPECT_RISK-REWARD_RELATIONSHIP .
13034	2721	If we elect ASPECT_RON_PAUL_and ASPECT_PAUL_POLICIES somehow get enacted -LRB- or of -RRB- and work as PAUL claims will , WE 'll know to try and get like PAUL in office .
13035	2721	If not , WE know to not elect like PAUL again .
13036	2722	You must be joking .
13037	2722	I already listed plenty of pix , vids , and links regarding -- of which you denied your ASPECT_INTEREST .
13038	2722	If you want , ASPECT_SEARCH_I ASPECT_POSTS , I 've uploaded pix from 2 ASPECT_TEA_PARTIES I attended and I assure crowd was mixed .
13039	2722	is ASPECT_POLITICAL_FORUM .
13040	2722	Forum : ASPECT_PUBLIC_MEETING_PLACE for ASPECT_OPEN_DISCUSSION .
13041	2722	There is no ASPECT_RESTRICTION on having than your ASPECT_OPINION_and ASPECT_ARSEHOLE .
13042	2722	ASPECT_INFORMATION_and ASPECT_FACTS ARE allowed .
13043	2722	Since your ASPECT_OPINION has little ASPECT_VALUE in lieu of facts -LRB- or even attempt at sharing info -RRB- , I 'll leave you to define and hold your ASPECT_CONVERSATION with yourself .
13044	2724	Why does matter ?
13045	2724	blacks claim to be democrats .
13046	2724	There are plenty of blacks in ASPECT_TEA_PARTY .
13047	2724	Using your ASPECT_LOGIC ... blacks are race who is n't racist ... so we must look at them to determine if ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is racist .
13048	2724	It 's comical at best .
