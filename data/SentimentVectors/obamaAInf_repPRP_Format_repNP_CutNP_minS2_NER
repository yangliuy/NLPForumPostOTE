1	3	Come on zero , take stance ... ASPECT_LOL . 
3	3	Are you holding out for deal ? 
4	5	I 'm not taking stance on 1\/4 of term . 
5	5	When his term is over , I 'll give answer . 
6	6	Would you vote for ASPECT_PALIN ? 
7	7	Start providing facts to back up HE statements . 
8	7	Even if are true , does n't mean he or are wrong , that conservatives do not agree . 
9	8	Are you freakin ' nutz ? 
10	8	ASPECT_PALIN is ASPECT_BIMBO ! 
11	9	So you 'll take stance on ASPECT_PALIN ... already made up your mind ... but STANCE 's to early to take stance on ASPECT_OBAMA ??? 
12	9	's pretty funny ... 
13	11	Why would you agree with of what I listed , assuming they are correct ? 
14	12	was point I was proving . 
15	12	Folks have no idea how ASPECT_PALIN would do , yet FOLKS would not vote for her , but FOLKS still have n't made up folks minds about ASPECT_OBAMA , even though ASPECT_OBAMA has proven to be disaster . 
17	13	Begin to soar ? 
19	13	WE say NO because we know how ASPECT_OBAMA is trying to -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- we . 
20	14	No i would not . 
21	14	And I know what you 're trying to do . 
22	14	I vehemently disagree with her . 
23	14	With ASPECT_OBAMA , I have to take of wait and see approach . 
24	14	things I have liked and others I have n't , so I 'll wait . 
25	15	I 'll vote for ASPECT_OBAMA over of Republicans now in field . 
26	15	ASPECT_OBAMA has kept ASPECT_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN promises . 
27	15	ASPECT_OBAMA has n't gotten everything through yet , but CAMPAIGN early in ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM . 
28	15	I do n't watch ASPECT_FOX so I have no trouble keeping up with what FOX doing .95 of Americans got ASPECT_TAX_CUT year and . 
29	15	Does your 95 include world or ? 
30	15	I do n't have problem with spending ; I know where PROBLEM 's going . 
31	15	PROBLEM way too early to worry about deficit . 
32	15	PEOPLE are n't people . 
33	15	ASPECT_OBAMA was legitimately elected as was congress . 
34	15	They 're doing what THEY said THEY 'd do while campaigning . 
35	15	ASPECT_OBAMA has n't weakened security in way . 
36	15	I do n't watch ASPECT_FOX so I know about terrorist plots were just thwarted . 
37	15	Finally , ASPECT_PAKISTAN is going after ASPECT_AL_QAEDA on THEY side of border . 
38	15	's pretty big coup . 
39	15	ASPECT_FOX has neither proposed nor passed legislature hurts Americans . 
40	15	ASPECT_FOX has strengthened ties with traditional allies . 
41	15	ASPECT_FOX has stood up to enemies . 
42	15	I am not aware of single instance where ASPECT_OBAMA lied . 
43	15	As far as ASPECT_BS goes , ASPECT_OBAMA is politician and enemies suffer from that bit . 
44	16	Actually if you notice , Sly already participated in poll ... so not so funny . 
45	16	Instead fail on your part . 
46	18	Basically none of will or can happen . 
47	19	So its safe bet I wo n't vote for man . 
48	19	Just as I suspected . 
49	20	Honestly I do n't know how you could possibly expect ASPECT_CONGRESS or President to give up salary until American got job , which to I knowledge has never happened in history of country . 
50	20	tells I your expectations are completely unreasonable . 
51	21	You 're not worried about spending . 
52	21	To early to worry about deficit . 
53	21	Strengthened ties with allies . 
54	21	stood up to enemies . 
55	21	Wow ... just wow . 
56	22	ASPECT_OBAMA has done pretty good job as President , so already your thread is big fat fail . 
57	22	And , as far as going down as worst president surpassing ASPECT_CARTER - I believe georgie boy has already done that . 
58	22	And , was rasmussen poll -LRB- right-leaning poll -RRB- - so , your second pronouncements is also erroneous . 
59	22	Do conservatives ever get anything right ? 
61	22	ASPECT_JIMMY_CARTER -LRB- 57 favorable , 34 unfavorable -RRB- 18 .

73	22	One of ASPECT_AMERICA leading historians assesses george w. bushsean WILENTZPosted apr 21 , 2006 12:34 pmflashback : ASPECT_BUSH in '99 -- We Warned You ! 
74	22	ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH presidency appears headed for colossal historical disgrace . 
75	22	Gee , conservatives expected ASPECT_BUSH to accomplish ASPECT_BUSH promises by jan 21 , 2009 , so of course conservatives are disappointed . 
76	22	More so than ASPECT_BUSH . 
77	22	Another lie . 
78	22	ANOTHER has not raised taxes . 
79	22	To undo what ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH did - and it has helped . 
80	22	We 'd be in depression if Republican was in office . 
81	22	Never mind when ASPECT_BUSH was doing DEPRESSION , at least ASPECT_OBAMA is doing DEPRESSION to help not help ASPECT_BUSH , like ASPECT_BUSH . 
82	22	ASPECT_BWAHAHA , ASPECT_BWAHAHA ignores Party of No and NO followers , uses tactics used by Republicans , which I guess FOLLOWERS have forgotten . 
83	22	Another big fat lie being propagated by ASPECT_GOP . 
84	22	Another big fat lie . 
85	22	ASPECT_BWAHAHA has done more for world peace than bozo , war monger ASPECT_BUSH ever did . 
86	22	We had enemies because of ASPECT_BUSH . 
87	22	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN ASPECT_PARTY and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN cohorts , i.e. ASPECT_FOX news , ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , ASPECT_LIMBAUGH and motley crew at Faux news are ones spewing lies . 
88	22	Hell yes , ten times over ASPECT_REPUBLICAN clown ASPECT_GOP puts up . 
89	23	from did n't worry about ASPECT_BUSH spending , or fact that ASPECT_BUSH had surplus and blew spending and handed ASPECT_OBAMA deficit . 
90	23	And yes , ASPECT_OBAMA has strengthened ties with allies and stoop up to enemies , fact that you are are n't aware of YES is because ASPECT_OBAMA does YES with finesse , not like buffoon had before . 
91	23	i.e. ASPECT_BUSH = `` I.E. 'm Decider ! 
92	24	ASPECT_OBAMA approval rating is 47 . 
93	24	ASPECT_OBAMA term average is 57 average for us presidents -LRB- since FDR -RRB- is 55 , so ASPECT_OBAMA is doing better than . 
94	24	Your beloved reagan had 44 at time in office as ASPECT_OBAMA . 
95	24	-LRB- So ASPECT_OBAMA is doing better -RRB- . 
96	24	Maybe you should open your eyes . 
97	24	What is dangerous for ASPECT_AMERICA is GOP with ASPECT_AMERICA whackos . 
98	24	Beginning with ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , ASPECT_MICHELE ASPECT_BACHMANN , ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER and who have advocated violence , who makes inciting comments like `` Do n't retreat - reload and `` time YOU 'll come armed . 
99	24	What bunch of uncivilized nitwits . 
100	24	Who are you that ASPECT_US should worry about being penalized ? 
101	25	Not really . 
102	25	salaries are stipend . 
103	25	STIPEND about power . 
104	26	Your answers are that of typical blind ASPECT_OBAMA_SHEEP . 
105	26	ASPECT_OBAMA will be worst president . 
106	26	ASPECT_OBAMA will not keep ASPECT_OBAMA_PROMISE about ASPECT_TAX_CUT for 95 of ASPECT_AMERICANS . 
107	26	ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_HCR_BILL is proof of . 
108	26	ASPECT_OBAMA wants VAT for Christ sake . 
109	26	What do you think is ? 
110	26	ASPECT_OBAMA_DOH has stopped enforcing ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_LAW . 
111	26	They have tied hands of local law enforcement agencies in seeking illegal aliens . 
112	26	ASPECT_DOHS has cut border agents . 
113	26	ASPECT_DOHS has weakened ASPECT_BORDER_SECURITY , thus , or ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY . 
114	26	Cap & tax is next , then amnesty . 
115	26	Destructive for ASPECT_AMERICA . 
116	26	None of what I said are lies . 
117	26	You will see . 
118	27	ASPECT_OBAMA is on ASPECT_OBAMA way down . 
119	27	tea party folks are Americans of walks of life . 
120	27	Open your eyes . 
121	27	FOLKS have not advocated violence - you lie there . 
122	28	He has , in fact , already signed 640 billion in ASPECT_TAX_HIKE , 14 of which violate HE promise to 95 of ASPECT_AMERICANS .

124	29	How can I take stance whenever he has pleased and disappointed I at time ? 
125	29	Perhaps it is easier for you because situation is black and white -- with 'd ' next to HE name , your mind was decided . 
126	31	I do n't care what letter he has next to HE name . 
127	31	HE is utter failure and fraud . 
128	32	So is how conservatives vote ? 
129	32	Wondering how would do ? 
130	32	Interesting , no wonder voted in ASPECT_BUSH . 
131	32	ASPECT_PALIN has already proven herself to not know much . 
132	32	Why would with brain consider HERSELF `` just to see how HERSELF would do ? 
133	32	HERSELF would totally destroy country , is how HERSELF would do . 
134	32	ASPECT_OBAMA is doing fine . 
135	32	ones finding fault with things ASPECT_OBAMA is doing are neo-cons , right-wing , ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER , not much to consider . 
136	32	ASPECT_PALIN criticized ASPECT_OBAMA for ASPECT_OBAMA_STANCE on reducing nuclear weapons . 
137	32	Did she even bother to check ASPECT_REAGAN was trying to do ? 
138	32	So , ASPECT_REAGAN , your idol was right , but ASPECT_OBAMA is wrong ? 
139	32	ASPECT_BWAHAHA - just goes to show conservatives do n't know much about anything except complaining . 
140	33	Of ASPECT_COURSE_NOT , is why poster claimed they would vote for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
141	33	All right-wingers can do is whine and cry and belly-ache , because THEY are not in power . 
142	33	I wonder if BELLY-ACHE would require of Rep ? 
143	33	I wonder if Rep would even consider of rep requests ? 
145	34	Not to mention insane ! 
146	35	said from whose posts exhibit ovine behavior - ASPECT_BAAAAAAAA ! 
147	35	doubt that will topple ASPECT_BUSH out of position . 
148	35	ASPECT_HCR is best could have happened to country . 
149	35	As is refined , and people -LRB- except right-wing sheep -RRB- will be able to see and ASPECT_OBAMA will get credit ASPECT_OBAMA deserves . 
150	35	is time for right to quit trying to control what ASPECT_OBAMA does or does n't do , you had your chance and you blew , with ASPECT_BUSH . 
151	35	sing-song sung by right . 
152	35	Enough with racial profiling , fence building and non-sensical methods applied by right . 
153	35	There are ways to destroy ASPECT_AMERICA , and would be to hand control over to right . 
154	35	ASPECT_BUSH did n't have cap & trade and ASPECT_BUSH nearly destroyed ASPECT_US . 
155	35	Well , being that you have already been proven wrong -LRB- you said ASPECT_OBAMA had not been able to do anything ASPECT_OBAMA promised -rrb- , it is hard to believe anything right says . 
156	37	Rove is liar . 
157	37	It 's ROVE ever does . 
158	38	You 've been saying that since jan 21 , 2009 ! 
159	38	His ratings are going up , so enough of your lies . 
160	38	As long as ASPECT_PALIN and rest of conservatives keep denying REST , REST will continue . 
161	38	I 'm sure conservatives are aware of what is going on , but CONSERVATIVES play innocent card , and pretend that what CONSERVATIVES do does not incite violence . 
162	38	Maybe you need to take your advice and open `` your eyes . 
163	38	In subsequent segment , titled DANGEROUS rhetoric : When heated words incite threats & violence , ASPECT_CNN s panel agreed ASPECT_OBAMA s ASPECT_POLITICAL_OPPONENT are inciting violence and are motivated by racism -- undeterred by ASPECT_PALIN s assurance , which ASPECT_CNN played : When I talk about SEGMENT 's not time to retreat , SEGMENT time to reload , what I 'm talking about -- now , media , try to get right , okay ? 
164	38	's not inciting violence . 
165	38	What 's doing is trying to inspire people to get involved in people local elections and upcoming federal elections . 
166	38	SEGMENT telling people that people arms are people votes . 
167	38	SEGMENT 's not inciting violence . 
168	38	SEGMENT telling people , do n't ever let anybody tell you to sit down and shut up , Americans . 
169	38	Lemon demanded : Is ASPECT_LEMON responsible for to say that ? 
170	38	Especially leader , considering anger 's going on right now ? 
171	38	Read : http : \ \/ \ \/ newsbusters.org \ \/ blogs\/brent-b ... #ixzz 0lpkydbnlanother example : Like disobeying orders from Commander in Chief ? 
172	38	If not violent , then just whackos ? 
173	38	Is n't just plain treason , and ignored by your party . 
174	38	Are kinds of idiots we need in military ? 
175	38	In promoting armed forces tea party patriots , ASPECT_STEIN has raised possibility of disobeying presidential orders . 
176	38	In one recent online posting , ASPECT_STEIN wrote : I oath was to Constitution , not to politicians , and that oath will be kept . 
177	38	I wo n't `` Just follow orders . 
178	38	There is at time debate within ranks of military regarding politicians oath . 
179	38	mistakenly believe must follow order president issues . 
180	38	But others do understand that others loyalty is to Constitution and to people ... declaration echoes one made by oath keepers , group of current and former military and law enforcement personnel who havevowed not to follow orders deemed to be unconstitutional -- including orders to disarm Americans . 
181	38	ASPECT_STEIN agreed that two groups are kindred spirits . 
182	38	`` ASPECT_STEIN think GROUPS 're very like-minded with Oathkeepers , ASPECT_STEIN said . 
183	38	`` ASPECT_STEIN strongly support Oathkeepers . 
184	38	`` ASPECT_STEIN political activism seems to have raised concern among stein superiors . 
185	38	Late month , ASPECT_STEIN wrote online : `` Was just told by marine corps officer to watch what ASPECT_STEIN say about ASPECT_OBAMA ... ASPECT_STEIN think not ... And later day : `` ASPECT_STEIN was just told to keep stein opinons -LRB- sic -rrb- to STEIN about ASPECT_OBAMA , by stein officer-in-charge -LRB- oic -rrb- . 
186	38	`` Indeed , ASPECT_STEIN may be violating military policies restrict political statements and activities by active duty personnel . 
187	38	`` ASPECT_LEBOWITZ 've seen military command go against people on lot less , ASPECT_MIKE ASPECT_LEBOWITZ , former jag lawyer who 's expert on issues of military expression , told TPMmuckraker . 
188	38	ASPECT_LEBOWITZ said one question is whether activity is judged to be `` partisan . 
189	38	Though ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT has formed ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY in states , and has endorsed and supported candidates in races , there 's no evidence that ASPECT_STEIN group has done so . 
190	38	ASPECT_WASHINGTON -LRB- CBS\/AP -RRB- political pundits knew ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM was going to upset critics and `` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY contingent , but PUNDITS probably did n't expect things to get violent . 
191	38	ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC leadership in ASPECT_CONGRESS is decrying recent `` acts of violence against 10 ASPECT_HOUSE_DEMOCRAT and one republican , including one report of cut gas line at house of brother of one member of ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
192	38	ASPECT_HOUSE ASPECT_REPUBLICAN leader ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_BOEHNER , ASPECT_R-OHIO , says ASPECT_BOEHNER knows that people are angry but denounced disturbing trend , saying , `` Threats and violence should not be part of political debate . 
193	38	former governor of ASPECT_ALASKA ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN criticized media for casting cbs\/ap and tea party activists as violent . 
195	39	Boy , do I agree with you . 
196	39	Besides , fight up will be financial regulation , not cap and trade . 
197	41	Evidence please , irrefutable evidence . 
199	42	Let see how what ASPECT_AMERICA looks like in summer of 2012 . 
200	43	Unless ASPECT_JESUS runs against JESUS , I will be voting for ASPECT_OBAMA in 2012 . 
201	44	valerie plame scandal . 
202	44	By his words too . 
204	46	ASPECT_BUSH did brilliantly in BUSH year , and look how ASPECT_BUSH turned out . 
205	46	years do not represent whole presidency . 
206	46	As for being penalized by you , golly . 
207	46	I darn near quivered in I boots . 
208	47	If 's pretty funny , your sense of humor is pretty crap . 
209	47	Try watching Daily show . 
210	47	Or maybe Borat . 
211	47	ASPECT_SNL even . 
212	48	I 'd rather have I eyes gouged out with crayons and I insides ripped apart by feral rats . 
213	49	It sounds to YOU like his opinion , and opinions do n't require evidencing . 
214	49	Incidentally , are you currently living in ASPECT_NIGERIA ? 
215	49	`` Location : God greatest country `` google search : God greatest nation : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.nairaland.com\/nigeria\/topic-98070.0.html 
216	50	I 'm guessing 's no. . 
217	51	Hmm ... I suppose NO. might seem way but I actually quite enjoy whole crayon Yep , NO. no. . 
218	51	who love ASPECT_AMERICA could never condemn her by voting for Sarahsquatch . 
219	56	poll means little without opponent to choose from . 
220	56	`` yes answers can become `` no , and `` no answers can become `` yes depending on catalog\/experience\/vision of person running . 
221	57	of your post is delusional , especially part about ASPECT_OBAMA not having lied . 
222	57	I am suggesting that you pull your head out of sand . 
223	58	Pull your head out of sand . 
224	58	Quit living in your false liberal utopia . 
225	59	Your post is but ignorant , liberal utopian garbage . 
226	59	Wake up ! 
227	60	He stated facts . 
228	60	Would you believe it more if article was written by ASPECT_KARL_MARX ? 
229	61	Of course liberals are trying to portray tea party folks in bad light . 
230	61	LIBERALS are afraid of LIBERALS . 
231	61	fact is that nobody has proof that tea party folks have been violent or racist in least bit . 
232	61	Sorry , but you failed . 
233	62	You just told me that years do not represent Presidency , ye ASPECT_PALIN has not even had , yet you say what you say . 
234	62	Kind of hypocritical , is n't KIND ? 
236	63	assumes we should vote for everyone regardless of stance , then judge after 4 years . 
237	63	There 's no contradiction is saying you would n't vote for -LRB- if you 're completely against them -RRB- and also state that you 'll wait for Presidency to transpire before giving accurate synopsis . 
238	63	CONTRADICTION 's like saying : `` No , YOU 'm not going to read dr. suess at age 45 , but biography on european conquest ? 
239	63	YOU 'll wait 'til YOU 'm finished reading contradiction to give you rating . 
240	64	You do realize that lot of disapproval comes from liberals who are upset with ASPECT_OBAMA for not ending wars and not closing gitmo , right ? 
241	64	people are not going to vote for Republican . 
242	64	PEOPLE may hold people nose when PEOPLE pull lever , but NOSE will be for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
243	65	No room for independents on one , you guys have to pick side . 
244	66	Reverse and what answer do YOURSELF come up with ? 
245	66	-LRB- -RRB- Look at approval numbers . 
246	66	See pattern ? 
247	66	, now ask yourself what has he done for black unemployment problem . 
249	67	No , not really . 
250	67	ASPECT_PALIN has not been president , therefore things I have to judge NO on are NO governorship -LRB- which has come to its end -RRB- and what NO says in public , and I am disgusted by both . 
251	68	Is ASPECT_KARL_MARX member of forum or are you just so desperate to change subject that you had massive brain fart ? 
252	69	Because formulating counterargument is much harder than simply attacking post content . 
253	71	time asks for link on opinion , I will refer them to you , if I may . 
254	72	ASPECT_FEEL_FREE . 
255	72	But first make clear to them that your opinion . 
257	73	What has he done for black unemployment problem ? 
258	73	Looks to me like ASPECT_AMERICAN have been hurting since Spring of 2007 . 
259	74	You ca n't `` pick side without 2 sides to choose from . 
260	74	poll does n't include opponent ... hence , POLL useless . 
261	75	Well then , they like abuse . 
262	76	I did n't change subject . 
263	76	You said that ASPECT_KARL_ROVE lied . 
264	76	I said ASPECT_ROVE did not . 
265	76	facts are facts . 
266	77	Well , when you feel like you are debating ASPECT_BRICK_WALL , then you wo n't waste your time . 
267	77	is what I am doing . 
268	78	I just wanted to know if who voted for him would have courage to vote for else since ASPECT_OBAMA is utter failure and fraud . 
269	79	ASPECT_JESUS ... If there my friggin choices i 'm voting indy again . 
270	79	Politics with Dumb and dumber , difference is ASPECT_PALIN would be president MY would n't mind seeing naked ... ASPECT_LOL

286	81	Kinda refutes whole idea right-wingers are espousing about how ASPECT_OBAMA is giving away jobs to ASPECT_OBAMA_FELLOW_BLACK at expense of whites , does n't KINDA ? 
287	81	Personally , I believe , as culture , we Americans are becoming bunch of wimps who are afraid of we shadows . 
288	81	picture of Great depression is good example . 
290	82	We watched ASPECT_BUSH do of for 4 years and then WE re-elected ASPECT_BUSH did n't WE ? 
291	83	We were expected to come out of , 's way we economy works , 's Capitalism . 
292	83	As far as fears of jobs I do not believe anybody claimed that yet , fears were with useless green jobs designed exactly for . 
293	83	I 'm sure you realize . 
294	83	Lets go back to original argument , why is his approval over ninety percent with them ? 
295	83	Actually close to 95 , ARGUMENT absurd there is no reason for . 
296	84	He was supposed to be un-bush , , , , , Remember ? 
297	85	So its ok to call palin names , but if I were to call ASPECT_OBAMA_RACIST , out cry would be unbearable , RACIST interesting stance you liberals take . 
298	86	COURAGE doubt intention , but if be your true intention , INTENTION would be smart to start by actually naming who they should `` have courage to vote for . 
299	87	lol Wait ... if calls ASPECT_PALIN `` name , you can think to do is bring racism into NAME ? 
300	87	Why not just equally call ASPECT_PALIN name ? 
301	88	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- is probably inane of of tea party whines . 
302	88	year since constitutional convention size of government has increased TO ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL . 
303	88	country has gotten bigger year TO ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL . 
304	88	ASPECT_WTF , man ? 
305	91	Why would n't he ? 
306	92	ASPECT_KARL_ROVE is liar . 
307	92	ASPECT_ROVE does n't know how to tell truth . 
308	92	ASPECT_ROVE 's one said to ASPECT_RON ASPECT_SUSSKIND , `` in what we call reality-based community , which SUSSKIND defined as people who `` believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality . 
309	92	... `` 's not way world really works anymore , ASPECT_ROVE continued . 
310	92	`` WE 're empire now , and when we act , WE create we reality . 
311	92	And while you 're studying that reality judiciously , as YOU will WE 'll act again , creating new realities , which YOU can study too , and 's how things will sort out . 
312	92	ACTORS 're history actors and ACTORS , of you , will be left to just study what WE do . 
313	94	So you do n't like ASPECT_OBAMA because ASPECT_OBAMA smarter than people and ASPECT_OBAMA knows it ? 
314	94	Oh dear . 
315	94	I hope you did n't go to Ivy . 
316	95	I was asking you why you brought ASPECT_KARL_MARX into it . 
317	95	I never mentioned ASPECT_KARL_ROVE , less called rove liar . 
318	95	Are you high or just confused ? 
319	96	Sorry Eldedu I was n't clear enugh for you I dislike ASPECT_OBAMA because ASPECT_OBAMA has not figure out who ASPECT_OBAMA wants to be yet and ASPECT_OBAMA does n't know it . 
320	96	We are watching ASPECT_OBAMA_MORPH from lesser university law lecturer turn into godlike proportions because of ASPECT_OBAMA great press who desperately want ASPECT_OBAMA tobe what ASPECT_OBAMA promises . 
321	96	Trouble with promise ? 
322	96	day you have to deliver . 
323	96	No eastern schools for I - ASPECT_SLO and ASPECT_USC ... I doubt I couild get into eastern school - not enough pedigree . 
324	97	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA campaigned on redistribution of wealth and ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM . 
325	97	ASPECT_OBAMA_PROMISE was met . 
326	97	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is no elitist , ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN makes accusations regularly and unfounded . 
327	97	both have college degrees , I do n't see how one is `` elite and is not . 
328	99	Do n't know yet . 
329	99	My poll was based on fact that ASPECT_OBAMA is like ASPECT_OBAMA portrayed ASPECT_OBAMA to be during ASPECT_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN -LRB- except distribution of welath , which ASPECT_OBAMA is certainly doing -RRB- , and if would change mind based on fact . 
330	100	Since you bring it up , how about you ? 
331	101	ASPECT_OBAMA is going to town with spending\/deficit increases , and ASPECT_OBAMA has just been in there for little over year . 
332	101	I think ASPECT_OBAMA will dwarf President . 
333	102	Good post . 
334	102	and folks are feeling way as FOLKS open folks eyes and see fraud that ASPECT_OBAMA is . 
335	103	ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE that he mentioned in HE article are facts . 
336	103	FAN do n't know about things HE may have said . 
337	103	FAN am not fan of or fact-checker for ASPECT_KARL_ROVE . 
338	103	FAN just know that ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE implemented by ASPECT_OBAMA in neighborhood of 640 billion so far , are fact of life right now . 
339	104	I may have gotten you confused with KVMJ . 
340	106	I agree totally . 
341	106	He seems un-American . 
342	106	people see that . 
343	107	Probably because he has trust even though 16 months into he 48 month term results are still lacking . 
344	107	Time will tell if trust voters put into HE is earned or if VOTERS 'll give chance at bat . 
345	108	He campaigned on providing americans with affordable health care and redistribution of wealth . 
346	108	ASPECT_TAX_BREAK for rich would have never acheived , ASPECT_AMERICA knew RICH was going to be liberal . 
347	108	RICH said americans making over 200k year would be taxed more , and is whats happening . 
348	108	If ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_W ASPECT_BUSH provided ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM way there would have been no outcry . 
349	109	He 's just like HE portrayed HE in ASPECT_HE campaign . 
350	109	Did you ever listen to speech ? 
351	110	What utter non sense you 're agreeing with . 
353	112	You can look at poll like and give benefit of doubt ? 
354	112	They went from loving ASPECT_CLINTON 's to vilifying THEY . 
355	112	What reason would THEY have to have ASPECT_CLINTON trust ? 
356	112	I 'll take wagers ... 
357	113	Other than gang members , kkk members , members of militias , serial killers , rapists , sex offenders , arsonists , radical members of and religions , etc. . 
358	113	Other than of them , MAN may well be dangerous man in ASPECT_AMERICA . 
359	113	Do you always exaggerate ?

366	116	Just maybe . 
367	117	When ASPECT_OBAMA came on scene black people turned people backs on clintons people hated PEOPLE , 's who 
369	118	Are there articles on event because I do n't recall it . 
370	118	I do know that , when given choice between hrc and ASPECT_OBAMA , ASPECT_OBAMA campaign began to quickly pick up minority votes as CHOICE became more viable . 
371	118	ASPECT_IIRC , earlier in year , ASPECT_IIRC was almost given that ASPECT_HRC would gain nomination . 
372	118	ASPECT_OBAMA was interesting candidate , but not think ASPECT_OBAMA could take ASPECT_HRC in primary . 
373	118	ASPECT_HRC was only as primary approached that PRIMARY appeared ASPECT_OBAMA could win PRIMARY . 
374	118	As member of ASPECT_GOP , I was rooting for sen. thompson for ASPECT_SEVERAL_REASON ... one of which was seeing mrs. thompson in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE for four years . 
375	119	She is wearing my negligee , MY swear . 
376	121	Thanks for link , but I still do n't get your point : 
377	122	Point is simple , ASPECT_DEVIL said back at my original chart that white voters wont vote for ASPECT_OBAMA because of color . 
378	122	's hypocritical when you see way blacks have voted . 
379	122	BLACKS give ASPECT_DEVIL 95 approval rating when DEVIL has not done for BLACKS , BLACKS have double digit unemployment and NONE of BLACKS have problem with ? 
380	122	Then to further look at BLACKS voting record look how BLACKS voted against ASPECT_CLINTON , person HAS helped BLACKS for how years ? 
381	122	ASPECT_BLACK_VOTE is obviously racist , numbers are right there . 
382	122	16 percent grab of ASPECT_BLACK_VOTE is absurdity . 
383	122	Just like 95 approval is . 
384	123	It does n't matter who implemented kind of ASPECT_HCR , IT would still have been met with resistance . 
386	124	ASPECT_TAX_BREAK for 95 of Americans ? 
387	124	No earmarks ? 
388	124	Not business as usual ? 
389	124	Think again . 
390	125	's what said . 
391	125	Open your eyes . 
392	126	black folks have opened folks eyes to ASPECT_OBAMA , and have no intention of voting for ASPECT_OBAMA again . 
393	127	I can assure you , if ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH implemented ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM way , everyone would have believed that REFORM would have reduced defecit . 
394	128	American , or majority would still be against anything forced , what do you not understand about ? 
395	128	ME also have to question your belief about reduced deficit , please show ME where has been done before or anything has come close to estimates . 
396	129	He tried . 
397	129	ASPECT_CONGRESS likes congress backroom deals too much . 
398	129	Place blame where CONGRESS belongs , not on whom you prefer to despise . 
399	129	There are no transitional fossils ! 
400	129	He effectively reduced . 
401	129	Be realistic . 
402	129	For ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
403	129	Far from business as usual from president . 
404	130	So country has tripled ? 
405	131	I do n't believe that at ... 
406	132	He would have been vilified as sneaky socialist dipping into ASPECT_AMERICAN peoples pockets even more to give there money to others . 
408	133	Speculating ... False . 
409	133	`` inherited over 1 + trillion dollar national debt from ASPECT_CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION . 
410	133	In ASPECT_CLINTON 1st year in office , beloved `` spender-n-chief obama increased deficit , spent 3.5 trillion dollars and added over 1.5 + trillion dollars to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT , new record . 
411	133	Come 2012 , ASPECT_OBAMA will have added over 5 + trillion dollars to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT in just 4 short years . 
413	133	ASPECT_ISREAL support for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA continues to decline . 
414	133	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA dropped bombs in ASPECT_PAKISTAN , ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN and ASPECT_YEMEN murdering precious life innocent blood . 
415	133	Furthermore , `` war of necessity -LRB- ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN `` conflict -RRB- that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA once labeled proceeds on with marginal protests by left wing `` moonbats One nation under bufoon of ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA , about as sharp as bowling ball ... 
417	134	, what you are looking at is bradley effect , opposite ... When they go vote effect will be ASPECT_OBAMA , bet on EFFECT . 
419	136	Wrong assumption . 
420	136	I voted for ASPECT_GWB , but would not have been for ASPECT_HCR way ASPECT_GWB has been done , nor would I believe that government entitlement program would reduce deficit . 
423	138	Does n't matter what you believe . 
425	139	Because he is 1\/2 ASPECT_BLACK ? 
426	139	do n't care that HE is 1\/2 back . 
427	139	see HE for what HE is ... statist . 
428	139	do n't like 1\/2 . 
429	140	bradly effect ... Bet your bippy . 
431	143	EldeduOne point regarding your remark about higher education . 
432	143	Surprisingly one you find out in attending universities is attendance , even completing requirements and passing with diploma once completed ... ... . 
433	143	does not make person more intellectual ... . 
434	143	educated ... . 
435	143	which in depends upon what person does with education . 
436	144	Dear Dear frogger Of posts which have inspired me , or moved ME , or made me think , or laugh , or cry ... above post you have delivered , nails exactly what is in me heart about man in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE . 
437	144	FROGGER is not , nor will never be , President to ME . 
438	145	reason we are afraid of them is because you never know when another mcveigh is going to emerge from tea baggers group , and how innocent people would be hurt , not because PEOPLE have credibility or substance . 
439	145	proof we have is how conservatives come to conservatives defense and deny CONSERVATIVES are racist . 
440	146	No doubt about it ! 
441	146	I like his determination . 
442	147	ASPECT_BOBO was ASPECT_BUSH . 
443	147	ASPECT_BOBO is gone , -LRB- good riddance . -RRB- 
444	147	Get with latest ! 
445	148	's no-brainer . 
446	148	Who could ASPECT_GOP possibly put up ? 
447	148	Paiin , ASPECT_MCCAIN , ASPECT_ROMNEY , ASPECT_PAUL - they 're losers , not hard to predict . 
448	149	ones with heads in sand , are desperate conservatives as CONSERVATIVES try to convince country that things are bad under ASPECT_OBAMA . 
449	149	People are able to see for PEOPLE - your strategy is n't working . 
450	150	You do n't like my post because as loyal , palin idolizer , you ca n't handle truth . 
451	150	Keep spreading your `` gloom and doom - nobody believes that trash anyway , except comatose conservatives . 
453	151	ASPECT_PALIN has n't served as President , so of course she has n't had ! 
454	151	We do n't need to put SHE in position to affirm fact that SHE is stupid , that SHE thinks SHE knows lot about politics because she followers drool over everything she says . 
455	151	There are people other than droolers , and WE do n't give SHE pass - and you would have to be comatose to vote for SHE . 
457	152	reason you feel like you are debating ASPECT_BRICK_WALL is because you have skewed opinion and wo n't admit facts contradict OPINION , when given to you . 
458	152	Of course I 'm not going to agree with lies being spewed here . 
459	153	Geez , like you have n't called ASPECT_OBAMA_NAME ? 
460	153	And , fact that ASPECT_PALIN is bimbo has to do with her being white , HER is just dumb , WHITE does n't matter what color her is . 
461	154	Could it be because even dumb sarah is able to recognize that ASPECT_OBAMA graduated from ASPECT_HARVARD , ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM_LAUDE , while ASPECT_SARAH attended 5 colleges , and SARAH still does n't know much ? 
462	155	No speculation . 
463	155	conservatives on forum adored ASPECT_BUSH , warts and , and would never have criticized anything ASPECT_BUSH did . 
464	155	Is according to ASPECT_REPUBLICAN rewriting of History ? 
465	155	ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON reversed ASPECT_REAGAN course , raising taxes on wealthy , and lowering WEALTHY for working and middle classes . 
466	155	produced longest sustained economic expansion in ASPECT_AMERICAN_HISTORY . 
467	155	Importantly , also produced budgetary surpluses allowing government to begin paying down crippling debt begun under ASPECT_REAGAN . 
468	155	In 2000 , ASPECT_CLINTON year , surplus amounted to 236 billion . 
469	155	forecast ten year surplus stood at 5.6 trillion . 
470	155	It was black ink ASPECT_AMERICA would see for decades , perhaps forever . 
471	155	ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH immediately reversed ASPECT_CLINTON policy in order to revive ASPECT_REAGAN , once again showering embarrassment of riches on already embarrassingly rich , ASPECT_BUSH `` base as ASPECT_BUSH calls them . 
472	155	ASPECT_BUSH ladled out 630 billion in ASPECT_TAX_CUT to top 1 of income earners . 
473	155	In true republican fashion , EARNERS returned favor by investing over 200 million to ensure ASPECT_BUSH re-election . 
474	155	Do math . 
475	155	630 billion return on 200 million investment : 3,160 for 1 . 
476	155	I 'll give you 3,160 . 
477	155	All I ask is that you give I 1 back so I can keep goodness flowing . 
478	155	Do we have deal ? 
479	155	Republicans know return on investment . 
480	155	What you forget to mention is that doing would have put WE in depression . 
481	155	ASPECT_OBAMA had to do major surgery to repair damage caused by ASPECT_BUSH . 
482	155	WE owe we thanks to ASPECT_BUSH ! 
483	155	ASPECT_ISRAEL is not world , but still , is just conservative rhetoric . 
484	155	ASPECT_OBAMA supports ASPECT_ISRAEL . 
485	155	apr 9 , 2010Do you approve or disapprove of ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION handling of u.s.-israel relations ? 
486	155	new , annual survey of ASPECT_AMERICAN jewish public opinion by ASPECT_AMERICAN jewish committee finds that Jews , by and large , continue to approve of obama 57 percent say they approve of ASPECT_JOB_OBAMA doing and also back ASPECT_OBAMA handling of ASPECT_ISRAEL . 
487	155	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.politico.com \ \/ blogs\/bensmi ... on_Israel . 
487	155	html Well , it is apparent that Republicans do not like ASPECT_OBAMA , but to take WELL to level of lying about ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY is totally wild . 
488	155	buffoon we 've had was ASPECT_BUSH and thank god ASPECT_BUSH is history -LRB- bad history at -RRB- . 
489	156	What conservative rock did you crawl out from ? 
490	156	Where did you hear that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE was free , on Faux news ? 
491	156	No wonder . 
492	156	rest of your post sounds like ASPECT_LIMBAUGH mentioned on one of his loony rants . 
493	158	Consider ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN as idi amin - they both have IQ . 
495	159	Now is one accurate post ! 
496	159	Good job ! 
497	162	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- He probably will dwarf president . 
498	162	I 'm pretty sure that HE would have preferred to take office after ASPECT_CLINTON than after ASPECT_BUSH . 
499	163	I would need proof of , I still think you will see huge vote for color in upcoming election , same as . 
500	164	If ASPECT_OBAMA has let banks fail , and not pushed stimulus of ASPECT_SIZE_OBAMA did , we would currently be facing similar situations as took place in 1920 and 1930 , runs on banks , 25-30 unemployment , return of Hoovervilles . 
501	164	ASPECT_OBAMA , if for no reason will be favorably looked upon 50-100 years from now as one who had courage to take risk , and invest in ASPECT_AMERICA , instead of pulling everything in , and letting COURAGE die . 
502	164	Do you really know what VAT is ? 
503	164	people who are calling for flat tax , or major change to taxation are in favor of methods similar to VAT , because unlike ASPECT_INCOME_TAX , with of it 's loopholes , value added tax , or consumption tax . 
504	164	TAX fair than BS we deal with now , and means people pay fair tax burden . 
505	164	TAX 's also easier to track than trying to keep history on ASPECT_AMERICAN income , since TAX collected at business level at time of sale . 
506	164	You only have to track businesses , so it essentially means end of ASPECT_IRS as WE know END . 
507	164	I 'd love to see major reduction in irs i , is n't that smaller government ? 
508	164	I have n't looked at great deal , but ASPECT_BUSH did n't exactly spend alot of time trying to secure we borders either ... in fact as I recall ASPECT_BUSH wanted to give em amnesty ... so at worst WE 're no worse off than before . 
509	164	Cap and trade is good idea , and if CAP gets WE as country off of Oil , and using renewable energy , we as country will be way ahead of rest of world , and be able to laugh when oil runs out . 
510	164	Because day , DAY certainly will , and I for one would rather have renewable form of energy ready sooner rather than later . 
511	165	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- well , we do have trillion dollars worth of wars to contend with year -LRB- WE should count wars as off-budget items like ASPECT_BUSH did -RRB- . 
512	165	And annual trillion dollar defense budget . 
513	165	Not to mention huge hole in budget ASPECT_BUSH left behind by ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT , which , I heard , has cost treasury 2.6 trillion dollars . 
514	165	And ASPECT_BANK_FAILURE . 
515	165	And export of of major tax revenue-producing industries . 
516	165	Did I mention that Depressions are expensive ? 
517	165	Like brie with whine ? 
518	166	please you fail at your attempt at trying to be and sound like elitist also . 
519	166	His spending of control . 
520	166	Worse by far then president ... Socialism costs lot of ASPECT_PEOPLE_MONEY , so HIS can keep spending ... LOL 
521	167	likely . 
522	167	HE has kept of HE ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_PROMISE . 
523	167	HE has been transparent . 
524	167	HE has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no ASPECT_TAX_CUT for 95 of ASPECT_AMERICANS -RRB- , which is desparately needed . 
525	167	HE has increased spending\/size of government to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL , and saved us from another great depression . 
526	167	He has \ \/ will increase ASPECT_US deficit to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL , and saved ASPECT_US from another great depression . 
527	167	HE pushes through legislation HE promised to do and was voted in for . 
528	167	HE has strengthened ASPECT_AMERICA position in international community , and reversed new cold war . 
529	167	HE has several proposed policies will help Americans and ASPECT_US economy . 
530	167	HE is welcomed by us allies and isolating ASPECT_US enemies . 
531	167	HE is continuously lied about by conservative media . 
532	167	ECONOMY depends on who is run against HE , but ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION has been big positive change for ASPECT_AMERICA . 
533	169	ASPECT_MCVEIGH was nut job . 
534	169	group has them . 
535	169	For part , tea party folks are average everyday folks are sick and tired of big bureaucracy , big government , government waste , and ever-increasing taxes . 
536	169	There are racist people in groups , but to call tea party movement racist or violent , just exhibits ignorance . 
537	170	ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH : It does n't matter who is President now . 
538	170	Things are bad , and they are not headed in right direction . 
539	170	economic recovery and ASPECT_JOB_CREATION comes from ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR , not government . 
540	170	economic recovery would happen if RECOVERY were not for government getting in way . 
541	171	I do not idolize ASPECT_PALIN . 
542	171	I like her . 
543	171	I believe that I have told you in another thread while back , that I really hope that HER does not run . 
544	171	I think there are better candidates out there . 
545	171	I just hope that HER continues to be pain in butt for left , and spreads word about CANDIDATES that ASPECT_MSM does not like to . 
546	172	funny is that folks knew that ASPECT_OBAMA was n't ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL , and now ASPECT_OBAMA has proved that ASPECT_OBAMA is not ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL , yet you drones still follow OBAMA like sheep heading toward cliff . 
547	173	Well , we have skewed opinions , otherwise WE would be brain dead . 
548	174	stimulus was failure and full of earmarks . 
549	174	Invest in creating record deficit , with little to show for DEFICIT . 
550	174	problem is that VAT , if implemented , would be additional tax , and not replace anything . 
551	174	ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_MCCAIN , and obama support amnesty . 
552	174	fact remains that ASPECT_OBAMA has gone backward on enforcement . 
553	174	We know that WE need alternative forms of energy . 
554	174	Cap & trade is but tax on corporations will trickle down to goods and services , because everything takes energy to produce , transport , etc. . 
555	175	I do n't know whether to laugh at as joke or cry at because of how ignorant and misinformed you are . 
556	176	Funny , I had reaction reading your op .

574	187	Conservatives hit you with CONSERVATIVES !

581	190	if you want fair and balanced your option nowa days is ASPECT_CNN . 
582	190	you really think that if times were better people like ASPECT_GLEN_BECK would have been able to capitalize on ASPECT_AMERICAN peoples anger toward government ??? 
583	190	who says that race is not factor driving ASPECT_OBAMA_HATRED tell do we think would be better with ASPECT_MCCAIN as president would economy be doing so better would jobs suddenly be sky rocketing ?? 
584	190	what could mccain be doin to help improve things ??? 
585	190	yes we would have smaller gov. .

589	192	Is ASPECT_KENIA in ASPECT_HAWAII ? 
590	194	Did you hear that on glenn beck show or was telegraphed from Mars ? 
591	194	Seriously , nice to have opinion on matter , so if you said you thought ASPECT_BECK was unfit , then fine . 
592	194	ASPECT_OTOH , when you say `` of YOU agree , would be proper to provide basis of your conclusion such as facts . 
593	194	Are you basing on scientifically verifiable polling data ? 
594	194	news article ? 
595	194	ASPECT_GLENN_BECK tears ? 
596	194	`` of YOU want to know . 
597	195	Not that I was basing I on statistic , just look up , and you 'll understand what I meant by us . 
598	196	poll question was `` Will you vote for ASPECT_OBAMA in 2012 ? 
599	196	not `` Is ASPECT_OBAMA fit to be President as you stated . 
600	196	could have voted No simply because want to see hotties in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE , not because of anyones fitness for office : 
601	197	you mean ASPECT_BAILIN and nojeans ? 
602	198	Awesome picture , ok , I 'll apologize ; I do n't want ASPECT_OBAMA in office , and I think ASPECT_OBAMA and socialists should go to ASPECT_CANADA . 
603	199	Where they can form stronger band of socialists ? 
604	199	Maybe THEY 'll go after Rush fulfills his promise of moving to HIS megabuck estate in ASPECT_COSTA ASPECT_RICA . 
605	199	Here 's another great campaign poster : 
606	200	Quite pair , right ? 
607	200	Or is two pair ? 
608	200	I 'm confused . 
609	200	Back on topic ; if ASPECT_OBAMA does n't get economy turned around in two years , ASPECT_OBAMA 'll join ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_H. ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH as one-term president . 
610	202	I do n't think male soldiers would have problem standing at attention if they were in cawe c'mon , had to say 
612	203	Even about kenyan born part . 
613	203	ASPECT_MICHELLE_OBAMA spilled beans on one when she referred to ASPECT_KENYA as ASPECT_OBAMA home country in speech . 
614	204	I 'm usually very accurate , but mistakes happen . 
615	204	If is you have got on conservatives , then I think we 're doing fine . 
616	205	I could sit here day posting videos of ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_OBAMA_CRONY spewing lies . 
617	205	For part , conservative radio and of conservatives on TV have part right . 
618	205	We 've got your . 
619	206	Another liberal drone . 
620	206	ASPECT_OBAMA fixing economy ... where ? 
621	206	ASPECT_OBAMA_TAX_CUT ... where ? 
622	206	Are you talking about ASPECT_U.S. ? 
623	207	is perception you get when your sole source of information is murdoch propoganda outlets . 
624	208	My questions are legitimate , and MY will be waiting for answers . 
625	209	He happens to love country more than ASPECT_OBAMA , you should keep that in mind ~ ~ ~ ~ 
626	210	What would you call American who loved ASPECT_GERMANY so much he puts german interests above ASPECT_AMERICA . 
627	210	I know what I 'd call AMERICAN . 
628	210	Hint ; ASPECT_GERMANY seven-letter word which begins with t. t. civilized to respect people even if people views are different or opposing , but how can respect txxxxxx even if PEOPLE favor your side ? 
629	211	I 'd salute ! 
630	212	You mean you are really unaware that ASPECT_OBAMA_STIMULUS_PACKAGE included over 300 billion in ASPECT_TAX_CUT , and you are really unaware that economy has gone from -6 &#37; annual growth rate to +6 , ASPECT_JOB_LOSS have gone from 700,000 losses to gains , unemployment rate peaked and is now lower , productivity is now growing at 6 , housing markets have stabilized and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET are up 70 since March ? 
631	212	You really do need to broaden your information sources because you are obviously not getting relevat information . 
632	212	No wonder you have negative view of ASPECT_OBAMA . 
633	212	of us who evaluate broader source of information know better . 
634	213	What makes you say ? 
635	214	Yes mertex we believe you . 
636	214	Everyone here knows that liberals fear of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT has to do whatsoever with liberals fear of being elected right out of power . 
637	214	While WE are at MOVEMENT shoveling load of b.s. that liberal lefts fear and hatred of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT has to do whatsoever with LEFTS fear of loss of political power , why do n't WE sell bridges or make money scamming people with ASPECT_NIGERIA email chain letter too while WE are at MOVEMENT . 
638	214	After if you expect LEFTS to believe that liberal lefts fear of and hate for ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT has to do with politics , you might as well as you clearly expect folks to beleive anything you tell FOLKS too believe . 
639	214	Too bad for liberals that gig is up , majority of people see LIBERALS for power hungry socialists liberals are , and also reject liberals and liberals ideology . 
640	214	Too bad liberals 're on way out November . 
641	214	-LRB- By way , ASPECT_DEMS lost badly here in ASPECT_OHIO in early provisonal voting . -RRB- 
642	214	ut oh ... 
643	215	Yeah I agree , I do n't get it things have been discussed to death , ONES are obvious ones . 
644	215	In fact of libs applaud ... LOL . 
646	216	You go to one source , others go to others . 
647	216	Just seems like you pay attention to optimistic side . 
648	216	Great point you made there . 
649	216	And , I dont think is worried RIGHT now . 
650	216	We are worried about country future . 
651	216	I dont care if ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH has happened over two months when they are passing legislation will lay stagnant for years . 
652	216	How does government go about spending tax money while providing ASPECT_TAX_CUT ? 
653	216	Fact : ASPECT_OBAMA 1st term increased ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT 4x than ASPECT_BUSH worst term . 
654	216	Not to let ASPECT_BUSH off line , but did forget ? 
655	216	They are using ASPECT_TAX_MONEY to pay back barrowed money + interest ? 
656	216	point is , providing ASPECT_TAX_CUT while spending is just another way to try to trick economy into getting better . 
657	216	What skeptics think is that when ASPECT_TAX_BREAK turn into ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE -LRB- which POINT will , or government will default -RRB- , thats when -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- hits fan . 
658	216	Stop thinking in now god d mn stop . 
659	216	Not successful business men thinks short term . 
660	217	I am so tired of hearing about ASPECT_TAX_CUT that ASPECT_OBAMA has blessed us with . 
661	217	Yet never seeing liberal anywhere who can point to precise ASPECT_TAX_CODE , precise item , or precise individual to which said `` cuts apply . 
662	217	So by means , if `` cuts do exist , show ASPECT_US where . 
663	217	Post links . 
664	217	Show ASPECT_US where and what precisely so called tax cuts were ? 
665	217	Which tax codes did `` cuts address . 
666	217	Who did cut taxation for ? 
667	217	What goods did cut taxation on ? 
668	217	By what percent did lower rate of taxation ? 
669	217	Simply declaring that ASPECT_OBAMA so called stimulus cut taxation , does not make TAXATION so . 
670	217	Just as simply declaring that ASPECT_OBAMA so called stimulus turned economy around and brought us out of recession did n't make STIMULUS so either . 
671	217	You see liberals , LIBERALS al know for fact that so called ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , increased taxation on poorest americans . 
672	217	Because AL increased taxation on tobacco and alcohol . 
673	217	And well , well , well , guess who just happens to drink and smoke in nation . 
674	217	You got GUESS , poorest americans . 
675	217	So where are `` cuts at Ireimon . 
676	217	Oh and if you happen to be referring to `` cuts he and HE demophony cronies in ASPECT_CONGRESS plan to make to medicaid and medicare . 
677	217	are not ASPECT_TAX_CUT , are robbing poorest americans , to give to richest , and are not in so called `` stimulus either but rather were in liberals healthcare dictate otherwise known as tyrantcare . 
678	218	WHO IS THEY ? 
679	218	tell me !! 
680	218	, why do you constantly lump people together , , why ? 
681	218	Dont you understand DONT makes you wrong automatically ? 
683	219	Now now in fairness there has been ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH . 
684	219	problem is however , that for job created , two others went away . 
685	219	administration , and ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION liberal supporters however always want to point to ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH in or economic sector , as for example supporters do inm pointing to creation of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_JOB , due to workers administration hired for census . 
686	219	Yet do so , while ignoring fact that in sectors of economy there was ASPECT_NET_LOSS in jobs , and jobs which YET created , are not permanent jobs but rather are temporary and YET will go away later year too . 
687	219	How hypocritical of left to lecture everyone about looking at `` broader picture when YET so excel at cherry picking data which suits YET . 
688	221	Flounder is n't it interesting that while telling us about how ASPECT_US need to run around `` fearing ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT , because of hatred and violence . 
689	221	And not because movement stands chance of kicking liberals out of political power . 
690	221	libtards libtards resort to use of hateful , sexualy , explicit denigrating , derogatory , terminology as `` ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER . 
691	221	USE does not get much more hypocritical than ladies and gents , than for liberals to lecture everyone about `` tone and `` respectful discourse while labeling ladies political opposition with deragatory terms as `` ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER and slandering movement with false , unsubstantiated , unspported by fact , assertions of violence . 
692	221	Especially given time and time again , in incident after incident , TIME been leftists who become\/became violent while protesting . 
693	221	ASPECT_INFACT , during term of former president ASPECT_BUSH , liberals who are now so worried about violence , defended things as assault and violence comitted by ASPECT_FELLOW_LIBERAL , in incidents such as throwing pies , vandalism to ASPECT_PRIVATE_PROPERTY saying actions comitted by leftists , in liberals name , for LIBERALS `` cause was defended as `` free speech and `` patriotism . 
694	221	And 's not even taking into account , LIBERALS attempted defense of recent attack on persons leaving ASPECT_REPUBLICAN fundraiser , by attempting to outright lie concerning facts of case . 
695	221	Claiming first that it was not liberals who were there protesting which comitted attack , and then falsely claiming that attack was not politically motivated , eventhough new orleans police department say ATTACK was . 
696	221	See once again , we are supposed to ignore fact that FACT by far , more often than not , leftists who become violent in face of opposition to LEFTISTS ideology . 
697	221	So liberals can pretend VICTIMS 're just poor misunderstood victims . 
698	223	You sound like rest of comatose conservatives , that listen to Faux news . 
699	223	CONSERVATIVES never get REST right , CONSERVATIVES just repeat BS conservatives hear on stations trying to pose as ASPECT_NEWS_STATION . 
700	223	What freebies are CONSERVATIVES getting , anyway ? 
701	224	But they would n't be true . 
702	224	THEY would be made up by Faux news to fool news viewers . 
703	224	If THEY had NEWS right , THEY would n't have lost . 
704	224	But , sooner or later NEWS is going to hit home , NEWS might take couple losses , kool aid has long lasting effects . 
705	225	Your `` fact is wrong . 
707	226	AGREED how I vote ; I consider field of candidates , CANDIDATES past accomplishments , issues at stake and best interests of country before voting . 
708	226	We 're two and half years out from election , TWO little early to be deciding ... unless EXTREMIST 're rabid extremist who will vote for or against based upon skewed political agenda . 
709	226	Then , by means , go right ahead and rant from your soapboxes in park . 
710	227	ASPECT_TAX_CUT will be wiped out with future tax increases . 
711	227	He has already signed for 640 billion in ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE . 
712	227	of jobs supposedly gained are ASPECT_TEMPORARY_JOB such as census worker jobs , and are ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_JOB . 
713	227	Economic recover happens from ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR , not government . 
714	227	There is talk of second wave of foreclosures and unemployment . 
715	227	Do n't buy into false numbers ASPECT_OBAMA likes to throw around . 
716	228	childish and baseless reply . 
717	228	If they are wrong , why does conservative radio and tv have highest ratings in country ? 
719	230	ASPECT_BUSH is even more reasonable for ASPECT_TAX_HIKE needed in future than ASPECT_OBAMA . 
720	230	prescription drug plan ASPECT_BUSH did n't even attempt to pay for FUTURE , ASPECT_OBAMA atleast has tried . 
721	230	Everyone says cuts to medicare and reducing subsidies for cadillac plans will be repealled , may be true in today politics , by 2018 debt will be so huge ASPECT_CHINA may no longer be buying ASPECT_CHINA . 
722	230	At point cuts will have to happen . 
723	230	ASPECT_BUSH got into ASPECT_IRAQ which has cost ton of money . 
724	230	ASPECT_IRAQ was optional , ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN was n't . 
725	230	ASPECT_BUSH second ASPECT_TAX_CUT was while debt was getting really big and ASPECT_US was already in 2 wars , ASPECT_TAX_CUT was perfectly fine . 
726	231	Now that you 've been informed about status of ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_TAX_CUT and economic performance , apparently for time , do you really believe that gdp , productivity , unemployment and like are ASPECT_NUMBER_OBAMA created ? 
727	231	Now who told you that ? 
731	232	He does own economy . 
732	232	blaming ASPECT_BUSH game is over . 
733	233	Of course , it 's ASPECT_BUSH fault , and always will be to you liberals . 
734	234	Presidents are generally over-credited as to economy by folks who lack comprehension . 
735	234	But I 'll add your statement to list of others who credit ASPECT_OBAMA for how economy is doing now . 
736	234	STATEMENT portends well for ASPECT_OBAMA in future . 
737	235	im not liberal , I am fiscal conservative . 
738	235	IF does actions cause long-term debt IM that person fault if tough measures have to happen to correct path that person help set . 
739	236	You are using old fashioned , pre 1981 meaning of word `` conservative . 
740	236	Back then MEANING meant you believed budget should be balanced , even if you had to raise taxes to do BUDGET . 
741	236	To today conservative , `` fiscal conservative means you cut taxes and borrow difference . 
742	236	Your terminology is just confusing to modern conservatives . 
743	238	No , No , No. ... he 's not worth it . 
744	238	I am glad majority of poll said `` No . 
745	238	HE is too unpredictable for I tastes . 
746	238	Just when you think HE is going to show bipartin efforts , HE let 's us down of time . 
747	238	I will definitely work hard at campaigning for ASPECT_PALIN if runs . 
748	238	I detest man and MAN stands for . 
749	238	I try to see good man does for ASPECT_US country but man vanity and self righteousness turns I off . 
750	239	Complete with ASPECT_JACK ASPECT_DANIEL chaser ?? 
752	240	Nope , I 'm just conservative who can barely dress himself day . 
753	240	I thoughts are so out of whack that I brain barely functions . 
754	240	I lived in ASPECT_MA and used to vote Democrat . 
755	240	I moved to ASPECT_NH , was raising family , attending `` town meeting times in I small town and learned fiscal responsibility in govt and I then realized that ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE , and conservative fiscal policy belongs in govt . 
756	240	I was hooked to conservatism and have never changed 
757	241	Oh it 's great . 
758	241	Unemployment hovering at 9.7 nationwide . 
759	241	Over 12 in ASPECT_CALIFORNIA . 
760	241	If you factor in folks who are no longer able to receive unemployment benefits , and working ASPECT_TEMPORARY_JOB , Underemployment\/unemployment is way high . 
761	241	Foreclosures still happening . 
762	241	Great economy . 
763	241	ASPECT_THANKS_OBAMA ! 
764	242	I 'm fairly conservative I , but I do n't like how ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY lies . 
765	242	They are not really conservative , so why buy into THEY lies . 
766	242	Besides , THEY are way too greedy for I . 
767	242	It is n't so much about being conservative , but about not wanting to help under-privileged . 
768	242	I could never be like . 
769	242	I lived in ASPECT_NH , also , in ASPECT_BEDFORD , worked in ASPECT_MA . 
770	242	ASPECT_NH was funny , people of ASPECT_NH did n't like people in ASPECT_MASS because PEOPLE came up to use people ski resorts and vacation in NH , and people in ASPECT_MASS did n't like people of NH because PEOPLE came to Mass and took jobs ! 
771	242	Pretty funny . 
772	242	I lived in ASPECT_NH because ASPECT_MASS was way too expensive , beautiful country but too -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- cold for I . 
773	243	Thank ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_BOZO is ASPECT_BOZO did it . 
774	243	You keep blaming ASPECT_OBAMA , but everyone knows it was ASPECT_BUSH tanked country . 
775	243	very limited in ability to decipher truth blame ASPECT_OBAMA for what party did . 
776	243	is getting pretty darn old . 
777	243	Take responsibility for your party mistakes and inabilities instead of repeating lies . 
778	243	country knew better nov 2008 , what makes you think 've forgotten ? 
779	245	By whose measure ? 
780	245	Don be sucked in by public polls . 
781	245	They can change quickly either way as president ASPECT_G. ASPECT_H. ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH found out in 1992 . 
782	245	year can make huge difference . 
783	245	ASPECT_OBAMA still has 2.5 years to find ASPECT_OBAMA_FOOTING . 
784	245	Time will tell . 
785	245	Who do you like for running against ASPECT_OBAMA ? 
786	247	It just proves one as far as I am concerned , ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE had no problem electing black president . 
787	247	IT ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_OBAMA_IDEA fell short , and IT can not be blamed on racism . 
788	248	ASPECT_BUSH had spending issues , and ASPECT_BUSH unfortunately , had bailouts of BUSH , but ASPECT_OBAMA took spending\/deficit creation to whole new level . 
789	248	ASPECT_BUSH increased size of government like nobody else . 
790	248	economic recovery happens from ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR , not government . 
791	248	You should know . 
792	249	Well then , I guess guy has his\/her work cut out for them . 
793	250	ASPECT_PALIN and ASPECT_OBAMA are n't apples to apples comparison . 
794	250	So , yes , ASPECT_PALIN is not worthy of consideration . 
795	251	ASPECT_PALIN retarded son would be step up as President than what we have now , ASPECT_BOBO , post turtle . 
796	251	Hell , SON ` ld vote for three day old dog turd vice , ASPECT_BOBO , post turtle . 
797	253	She cant get SHE to agree with . 
798	253	Since ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_JOB guarantees minority hiring 's way to recovery for SHE . 
799	253	prosperity and growth of ASPECT_AMERICA means , just like ASPECT_OBAMA . 
800	254	You are correct , ASPECT_PALIN was ten times more qualified for presidency than ASPECT_OBAMA . 
801	254	TEN simply unfair to lower her to ASPECT_OBAMA_LEVEL of incompetence and idiocy . 
802	255	Doubtful ... but I bet she looks lot hotter in bikini . 
803	256	Ok , maybe little overzealous , at least 9.4 times more qualified . 
804	256	I really do n't want either of images in I head , please stop ! 
805	258	We already know what conservatives vote for and consider `` intelligent - ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_PALIN , ASPECT_QUAYLE , so , no wonder you would think ASPECT_PALIN son would be step up ! 
806	258	ASPECT_OBAMA is nowhere near bottom of `` dumb pile along with your group - enjoy your sour grapes ! 
807	259	ASPECT_BUSH 41 I liked . 
808	259	ASPECT_BUSH 43 , not so much . 
809	259	ASPECT_PALIN I like . 
810	259	ASPECT_QUAYLE , I do n't like ... and there is no one , not even ASPECT_JIMMY ASPECT_CARTER , has been worse president than ASPECT_BOBO , post turtle . 
811	260	Leadership is n't test score . 
812	260	SCORE of attributes , sadly many that ASPECT_OBAMA lacks . 
813	260	president is supposed to be leader , not whiny appologist . 
814	260	We can certainly see now what liberal ` intelligence ' is getting WE , and people simply do n't like NOW . 
815	260	Obamabots seem to treasure obamabots ` intelligence ' . 
816	260	Has OBAMABOTS released ASPECT_OBAMABOT_TRANSCRIPT yet ? 
817	260	Just for comparison purposes . 
818	261	Not quite as chlldish and baseless as repeated mantra of `` so-called conservatives . 
819	261	Everything about Faux news is farce . 
820	261	First of , CONSERVATIVES ratings only include viewers for one `` ASPECT_CABLE_STATION . 
821	261	Add cable stations together , plus ASPECT_ABC , ASPECT_NBC , and ASPECT_CBS , and Faux news comes out short . 
822	261	Liberals are not glued to ASPECT_MSNBC - station compares to Faux news in NEWS biased broadcasting , as conservatives are to ASPECT_FAUX ASPECT_NEWS . 
823	261	So much for your ratings !

825	261	Have republicans been out-foxed ? 
826	261	conservatives are beginning to question whether ASPECT_FOX news is good for conservatives movement . 
827	261	By eve conant | newsweek web exclusiveapr 13 , 2010GOP sen. ASPECT_TOM ASPECT_COBURN scored perfect 100 on ASPECT_AMERICAN conservative union rankings for lawmakers year . 
828	261	makes EXCLUSIVEAPR one of people you 'd expect to criticize what liberals see as ASPECT_GOP most notable media mouthpiece , ASPECT_FOX news , but 's exactly what exclusiveapr did at recent town-hall meeting in ASPECT_OKLAHOMA . 
829	261	When audience member fretted about going to prison for not buying ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE , ASPECT_COBURN responded , `` intention is not to put in jail . 
830	261	makes for good tv on ASPECT_FOX , but is n't intention . 
831	261	When discussing disagreements with house speaker ASPECT_NANCY ASPECT_PELOSI , MEMBER described ASPECT_PELOSI as nice lady and warned jeering crowd to be civil and to get news from than one source : `` Do n't catch yourself being biased by ASPECT_FOX news that is no good . 
833	263	Mertex only you would add up stations to try to beat ASPECT_FOX , , ASPECT_HAHAHAHAHA . 
834	263	's like saying ASPECT_MICHAL ASPECT_JACKSON was never one , because if you add up singers records out sold MERTEX ... LOLOnly you ... . 
835	265	Hey , but Mertex thinks that if you do n't like ASPECT_OBAMA , you must have been sucking ASPECT_BUSH ying yang . 
836	265	's not case . 
837	265	of us had problems with past republicans , however , ASPECT_OBAMA makes look better day . 
839	266	's why and folks are leaning conservative . 
840	266	Adding others together , and comparing OTHERS to ASPECT_FOX as whole , is not apples to apples . 
841	266	Quit scraping bottom of barrel . 
842	267	Albeit VERY subjective argument , I 'm almost afraid to ask ... How did you come to conclusion ? 
843	267	-LRB- Please do n't just repeat talking points of your ` politician du jour ' -RRB- 
844	268	For starters governmental experience . 
845	268	Governor of state , state requires one to learn necessary skills to deal with far greater scope of issues , and do so in executive role . 
846	268	BELIEVER do not feel Senators make good candidates nor good presidents . 
847	268	It was great disappointment to BELIEVER to see ASPECT_MCCAIN and ASPECT_OBAMA as candidates . 
848	268	BELIEVER am very strong believer ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_EXPERIENCE is essential to good ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE -LRB- and no mayor does n't qualify , BELIEVER dispised concept of ASPECT_GUILANI even running -RRB- . 
849	268	BELIEVER personally feel that assessment is dead on with ASPECT_OBAMA , likewise BELIEVER think ASPECT_MCCAIN would have been weak president . 
850	268	Secondly after ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_CONGRESS was going to grab candidates balls back , which CANDIDATES promptly did . 
851	268	merely indicated that whoever president would be would not enjoy precieved executive powers ASPECT_BUSH had . 
852	268	For years candidates seemed to forget who candidates were and acted as executive atm machine , both sides contributed to , both are accountable . 
853	268	Couple that with president without ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_EXPERIENCE and you simply creating even weaker executive . 
854	268	experienced executive , even from small state , would better know how to deal with legistature as separate entity . 
855	268	experienced executive would also not allow CREATING to be steamrolled by ASPECT_CONGRESS , which it appears has happened to ASPECT_OBAMA since ASPECT_DAY_ONE . 
856	268	CONGRESS does n't help that ASPECT_CONGRESSIONAL majority is executive party , EXECUTIVE only has so room to put executive foot down before executive causes in-fighting . 
857	268	Therefore BELIEVER conclusion is that ASPECT_PALIN was indeed , after careful adjustment 9.4 times more qualified to be president than ASPECT_OBAMA . 
858	269	May I suggest , she is through bottom and is shoveling pure chit !! 
861	271	You see your holding back again ASPECT_RON , I thought we have spoken about before . 
863	273	ASPECT_DOW ASPECT_JONES has been climbing steadily.real-time news dow , up 70 ... ASPECT_S&P , up 9 . 
865	273	NASDAQ , up 11 By associated press business staff April 23 , 2010 , 4:15 pm updated at 5:50 p.m. unemployment is recovering . 
866	273	GDP kept climbing at end of 2009health care access to millionsAll in 18 months - than ASPECT_BUSH did in 8 years ! 
867	273	I do n't think your assessment of ASPECT_OBAMA is accurate . 
868	273	You may like ASPECT_PALIN , but 18 is not qualified to be president , not now , not ever . 
870	274	Ten strokes . 
871	276	I 've asked questions . 
872	276	Which one are you answering ? 
873	276	But , thank you for answering . 
874	276	does n't happen often on site . 
875	278	Obviously not adept at math . 
876	278	Your assessment of ASPECT_OBAMA is no more than echo of Faux news and ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH . 
877	278	Republicans in ASPECT_CONGRESS are more dangerous to nation . 
878	278	April 26 , 2010Younger ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTER are less enthusiastic about voting in year midterm elections than who are older . 
879	278	At time , 18 - to 29-year-old voters currently favor ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CANDIDATE in voters districts by 12-point margin over ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE . 
880	278	I did n't know ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH was ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN son ! 
882	278	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN needs to stick to trying to be President of ASPECT_PTA . 
883	278	is about bwahaha caliber . 
885	279	Your statements sound like from well rehearsed robot\/sheeple of conservative ilk . 
886	279	would vote for ASPECT_PALIN is in category as palin , uninformed and unintelligent . 
887	279	It is good that 17 year olds can not vote , from your statements , it is apparent that 17 year olds are not able to make intelligent choices . 
888	280	Looks like your in `` minority bubba . 
890	280	ASPECT_OBAMA is crashing and burning . 
892	281	Another `` ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH from `` fair and balanced ? 
894	282	You dont need to watch anything , just look up at poll alone , pretty obvious is n't ? 
895	282	82 to 52 . 
897	283	Liberals ca n't help poor republicans\/conservatives who only have one station liberals can trust , because STATION tells LIBERALS what LIBERALS like to hear , whether true or not . 
898	283	So what does REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES mean that ASPECT_FOX news has viewers than cable news stations ? 
899	283	That Republicans\/conservatives are tuned into REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES ? 
900	283	That there are Republicans\/Conservatives than liberals and independents ? 
901	283	That you are going to win election ? 
902	283	ASPECT_HA , ha is right - . 
903	283	Your analogy does n't even make sense , but then , of your posts , do n't . 
904	284	Where did your poll come from , ASPECT_WND ? 
906	284	polling group most recent poll for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BARACK_OBAMA : polling group -LRB- reverse chronologically -RRB- usa today\/gallup date April 24-26 , 2010Approval 51 disapproval 42 
907	285	You are actually citing pf poll as evidence of general populace ? 
908	285	Good lord . 
909	285	No wonder country is in shape wonder 's in . 
910	286	I guess 's why ASPECT_OBAMA beats both ASPECT_PALIN and romney in polls ? 
912	288	I think we can give prediction weight due your prediction that GDP in 4th 2009 would be negative . 
913	289	Well , ASPECT_OBAMA did say ASPECT_OBAMA would rather be good one-term president that mediocre two-term president . 
914	289	ASPECT_OBAMA 's not doing good term , so ASPECT_OBAMA better take ASPECT_OBAMA_ADVICE and skip second . 
915	290	Iriemon is right ! 
916	290	People that post here are actually paying attention to politics so unless PEOPLE believe in socialism , welfare , racist programs like Affirmative action , taking no responsibility for your actions , or redistribution of wealth people wont be voting for ASPECT_OBOMBYA . 
917	290	best conservatives can do to rid CONSERVATIVES of moron is to educate masses . 
918	290	For example 2 of my best friends and staunch conservatives are always dismayed by friends parents votes , FRIENDS always vote ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC because s way FRIENDS always voted and FRIENDS just don pay attention . 
919	290	FRIENDS both attribute friends beliefs and ideologies to friends parents so at heart friends parents are even more conservative then friends are and have taught FRIENDS well , FRIENDS just ca n't get friends parents to realize that Dems have been hijacked by loony tune left . 
920	290	Like fact that overwhelming majority of jewish families vote Democratic . 
921	290	Educate your neighbors conservatives and will be well ! 
922	291	I wish that of ASPECT_GENERAL_PUBLIC would open eyes and start to pay attention . 
923	291	way we could end catastrophe year and in 2012 . 
924	292	Yep , because look how dandy things went with presidents conservatives educated us to vote for . 
925	293	Just to show how senseless conservatives are , you misunderstood ASPECT_IRIE post . 
926	293	ASPECT_IRIE was actually saying majority on Forum are conservatives , and for to take poll seriously , as legitimate measure of country mood , CONSERVATIVES would have to be demented . 
927	293	Thanks for confirming what ASPECT_IRIE said . 
928	294	Sorry you missed it . 
929	294	We did -LRB- open we eyes -RRB- and WE did -LRB- pay attention -rrb- . 
930	294	is why WE have new administration in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE . 
931	295	Right , except it 's `` he `` irie = island slang for alright , as in `` everting be irie `` mon = man . 
933	296	Thanks for update - and lesson in island talk . 
934	296	I knew mon , but never heard of irie - your post was right on target , too bad `` right is n't clear on concept . 
935	297	Quite bit better than ASPECT_SEVERAL_PRESIDENT were promoted by liberals . 
936	297	ASPECT_OBAMA is taking financial irresponsibility to new heights , which does n't seem to concern liberals cried crocodile tears over ASPECT_BUSH spending , even though ASPECT_OBAMA spends magnitudes more ... ASPECT_CLINTON spent of ASPECT_CLINTON_YEAR neutered by ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS , and even so , ASPECT_CLINTON managed to pass massive tax increase in clinton couple years , after promissing cuts . 
937	297	ASPECT_CARTER was abysmal ... just ... AWFUL ... ASPECT_JOHNSON and kennedy were no prizes ... Even worst offensive republican , ASPECT_NIXON , was far outdone by offenses of ASPECT_CLINTON and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN cronies . 
938	297	Yep ... ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRESIDENT were just awful !!! 
939	298	Sure . 
940	298	We can compare ASPECT_CLINTON to reagan time you want . 
941	298	For lessers , let see how ASPECT_CARTER stacked up against either ASPECT_BUSH . 
942	298	will be fun ! 
943	298	ASPECT_CLINTON - Record low 3.8 unemployment , 22 million jobs created , ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET tripling even after 2000 correction , record 340 billion deficit inherited turned into surplus , longest post war boom on record , 3.9 per annum growth , decreasing ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_JOB . 
944	298	Just off top of my head . 
945	298	Your turn . 
946	299	Despite ultra libs like yourself , I still do believe that prosperous and secure ASPECT_AMERICA is possible . 
947	302	So so true , how soon forget , loss of power has brought out whiners by droves .

Charmingly written , book can benefit diverse readership . 
949	303	It means that conservatives get out and talk about concerns . 
950	303	wo n't sit around and let government turn into socialist government . 
951	303	GOVERNMENT amazing how informed of liberals are . 
952	303	Just wait till November buddy , NOVEMBER start of liberal downfall . 
953	303	will not stand for socialized healthcare . 
954	303	ASPECT_OBAMA will NOT be re-elected . 
955	303	ASPECT_OBAMA approval ratings are terrible . 
956	303	Also , lot 's of people who voted for ASPECT_OBAMA in 2008 -LRB- lazy people -RRB- , will not get out again in 2012 to vote , PEOPLE will rely on others to do things for PEOPLE ... wait , sounds like liberal way of life , 's because LOT is . 
958	305	That person who puts another country before is traitor ? 
959	305	I thought COUNTRY was obvious . 
960	308	I voted no because there was no `` Hell no ! 
962	309	Not exactly , I mean person . 
963	309	In what respect does PERSON do . 
964	309	Thank you for putting quote below ... 
965	310	\*\*\* You 'll most ASPECT_LIKELY_VOTE for obozo ? 
966	310	Gee , who would have ever guessed ? 
967	310	Notice that you did n't give sound reasons why you would vote for bozo , but you sure as heck gave lot of ridculous reasons why you would n't support Republican . 
968	310	Methinks you fall into category of ` fence sitter ' just waiting for wind to blow in favorable direction . 
969	310	But you did say one comes as close to possibility as anything , and is bozo may very well get assassinated with current mood of nation being as MOOD is , and or REPUBLICAN may very well get impeached or forced to resign in desperation to save what little marxist face ASPECT_REPUBLICAN has left . 
970	312	You must have been looking at old Faux ASPECT_NEWS_POLL . 
971	312	Actually , he is doing much better than conservatives give HE credit for , in spite of economic mess ASPECT_BUSH left country in when ASPECT_BUSH left office . 
972	312	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA s job approval rating improved week and now stands at 46 percent , up from record low of 43 percent approval in early April . 
973	312	equal of voters disapprove of job ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is doing -LRB- 46 percent -rrb- . 
974	312	And , is from ASPECT_FAUX news , now take look at true poll . 
975	312	cnn poll : obama approval ratings up Passage of landmark health care bill appears to have boosted ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BARACK_OBAMA approval rating , but POLL has not affected ASPECT_OBAMA re-election chances so far , according to new national poll . 
976	312	cnn\/opinion research corporation survey released Monday indicates 51 percent of Americans approve of job ASPECT_OBAMA is doing in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE , with 48 percent saying they disapprove . 
977	312	51 percent approval rating is up five points from week ago , before ASPECT_CONGRESS approved health care reform bill and president signed legislation into law . 
978	312	Four in ten respondents say RESPONDENTS disapprove because ASPECT_OBAMA is too liberal and 6 percent say RESPONDENTS president is not liberal enough . 
980	313	If you consider me ultra lib , no telling how far off your sense of reasoning skills are . 
981	313	ME 'm far from being ultra liberal , ME just do n't like conservatives who claim to be conservative and then practice complete opposite -LRB- ala ASPECT_BUSH -rrb- . 
982	313	At least , with Democrat , you are n't expecting extreme conservative , you know what you are getting . 
983	313	And , you are right , prosperous and secure america is possible , but not under ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_ADMINISTRATION - CONSERVATIVES lure problems and enemies . 
984	314	Oh , yeah ! 
985	314	You 'd like nukelar guy back ! 
986	315	Judging from comments on your post , is conservatives do , get out and talk ! 
987	315	But , they are so uninformed - and THEY keep believing Faux news that THEY are `` winning - wo n't THEY be surprised ! 
988	315	THEY need to tune NEWS to news instead of believing what Faux news keeps telling THEY .

990	316	fact that I do n't think he 's doing bad job ? 
991	316	If incumbent is not doing bad , reason to vote for challenger is if you think that challenger will do better . 
992	316	Burden is on challenger , who will most likely be hostile toward I ideology . 
995	316	Tell I ... which office-holder picks Supreme court nominees ? 
996	316	How do nominees last ? 
997	316	I think people are ridiculous for not considering scotus nominations as important motivation behind voting . 
998	316	Who is n't ? 
999	316	I lean on one side of fence , but until I get facts , I will not jump off . 
1000	316	SIDE foolish to jump before knowing what 's on ground . 
1001	316	Highly unlikely . 
1002	316	But it is possible president might leave office before term is up . 
1003	316	No point in saying what you 're going to do ASPECT_COUPLE_YEAR from now when you do n't know who is going to be involved . 
1004	317	Actually CONTRARY 's quite contrary . 
1005	317	Conservatives do research and come up with legitimate points . 
1006	317	When liberals are confronted with LIBERALS do things ... 1 . 
1007	317	LIBERALS say `` 's not true . 
1008	317	LIBERALS deny fact .2 . 
1009	317	LIBERALS change subject .3 . 
1010	317	LIBERALS call us racist , sexist , etc. 4 . 
1011	317	LIBERALS blame ASPECT_BUSH .5 . 
1012	317	LIBERALS say you are ignorant to get out of argument . 
1013	318	And since you did n't refute my cnn poll , MY will assume you either did n't read POLL or did n't understand POLL . 
1014	318	And you changed subject - is that way reps\/cons get out of argument ? 
1015	318	So , where is your poll saying that ASPECT_OBAMA ratings are going down - do n't post one from back when reps were making up lies about ASPECT_HCR and getting whole country to believe stupid lies - polls have been replaced now with people figured out sky did n't fall after and world did n't end , like conservatives promised . 
1016	319	For reason -LRB- -RRB- ASPECT_OBAMA does n't have ASPECT_OBAMA health scare program even beginning in ASPECT_EARNEST for four years . 
1017	319	Funny , I thought we had emergency that ASPECT_OBAMA_PROGRAM could n't be put off even day more . 
1018	319	was then , I suppose . 
1019	319	There is news about how ASPECT_OBAMA_CARE will actually cost than promised -LRB- surprised -RRB- and how corporations are going to end CORPORATIONS having ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE for corporations employees -LRB- swelling ranks of without , and raising costs even more -RRB- . 
1020	319	So if sky is n't falling , ASPECT_SKY because ASPECT_OBAMA_HEALTH_CARE is n't even running yet . 
1021	319	Are you ignorant of facts , or just disingenuous ? 
1022	324	So in effect when one stays home unvote went for candidate that wins . 
1023	324	In your case you helped elect ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1024	324	If you like what ASPECT_OBAMA doing then 's fine for you , if you do n't -LRB- and apparently you do n't by your above comment -RRB- then you 're part of problem . 
1025	324	I 'm speaking in general about non-voters . 
1026	324	vote is important , have fought and died for privilege -LRB- not right -RRB- to vote and election has consequences as has been and continues to be seen . 
1027	324	I too hope that true statesmen would run for office not sycophants that 've had to settle for past , years . 
1028	324	I suppose problem is that there 's so few of earlier and too of latter . 
1029	324	would even recognize statemen in time and day ? 
1030	324	Though I ca n't think of statesmen at time , perhaps might offer name or two of . 
1031	325	Portray it anyway you want to , I could no stomach idea of consenting to mccain presidency than I could to ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1032	325	I made IT very clear to I fellow republicans before we even got close to primaries I would never support ASPECT_OBAMA , and would refuse to vote if they chose to nominate ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1033	325	I would rather see liberal Democrat remind americans of how bad THEY are , than put another rino in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE and have majority of ASPECT_AMERICANS continue to blame WE for what are basically liberal policies . 
1034	325	differences between ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_MCCAIN were so minimal to I as to not be worthy of choice . 
1035	326	Oh yeah , ASPECT_OBAMA is world peace-maker and problem-solver ! 
1037	327	You are correct . 
1038	327	ASPECT_OBAMA got into office with everything but ASPECT_OBAMA_CREDENTIAL , which are non-existent . 
1039	327	sheeple of ASPECT_AMERICA voted for what they perceived to be coolest from apple , ipresident , without knowing is was completely defective . 
1040	328	Buyer remorse , . 
1043	329	what was alternative ? 
1044	330	Not given alternative . 
1045	331	I 've long been on record as refusing to vote rather than to vote for ASPECT_MCCAIN , but does n't mean I do n't think that ASPECT_OBAMA is worse than ASPECT_MCCAIN would have been . 
1046	331	Just various degrees of liberal bad . 
1047	332	Was n't even close , ASPECT_IMO . 
1048	332	ASPECT_MCCAIN would have been absolute disaster . 
1049	333	Unsupported partisan rhetoric really annoys me . 
1050	333	Is implying that he should have been able to ? 
1051	333	ME seriously doubt that majority of Americans would have supported single-payer health care package . 
1052	333	Is n't hcr package bad enough ? 
1053	333	ME actually see as positive and not negative . 
1054	333	ME do n't want of his campaign promises fulfilled . 
1055	333	Not completely but certainly major improvement over prior adminstration . 
1056	333	ME do n't think is has choice on . 
1057	333	HIS inherited government required ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE because of deficits which CHOICE created . 
1058	333	ASPECT_CONGRESS has not helped problem by creating new trillion ASPECT_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAM with ASPECT_HCR_BILL . 
1059	333	ASPECT_BTW better to raise taxes than to continue with deficits . 
1060	333	As has president in history . 
1061	333	He had good teacher in prior adminstration . 
1062	333	is actually ASPECT_CONGRESS which ignores People . 
1063	333	president can only sign or veto legislation . 
1064	333	is false . 
1065	333	As have presidents . 
1066	333	False again . 
1067	333	Of note who are considered as `` Allies should n't be . 
1068	333	While selective in his statements , often pulling information from context , is common practice for politicians . 
1069	333	HIS has not blatantly lied anymore than prior adminstrations . 
1070	333	Did n't vote for obama or mccain on 2008 because adminstrations were both losers . 
1071	333	ME wo n't vote for ASPECT_OBAMA in 2012 and seriously doubt ME will vote for ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE . 
1072	334	Maybe for Republicans politically . 
1073	334	's about best case you could make there . 
1074	334	Both of them would have been bad for country ... But ASPECT_OBAMA is far , FAR worse than ASPECT_MCCAIN would have been , and 's saying lot . 
1075	334	Then again , when takes dump in your cheerios , people are n't going to get baggie and weigh size of BAGGIE . 
1076	334	PEOPLE both sucked . 
1077	335	Hey man , do me favor and do n't rule out part yet . 
1078	335	ME still have slim hopes that we can come up with decent to run against YET ... 
1079	337	Pretty sure that there were n't ... 
1080	338	McCain\/Palin , though ASPECT_MCCAIN would have been rhino which would have meant keeping status quo which ASPECT_IMHO would have been preferable to what we have now . 
1081	338	Of course we conservatives would have preferred candidate more in line of ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN but I do n't see on horizon at time though ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN comes closest and I would vote for woman as well as minority , ` cept ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1082	338	As both sides say `` election has consequences . 
1083	338	And WE now are paying for consequences of obomba administration . 
1084	338	How well does work you who did n't vote ? 
1085	339	If CHOICE was choice between republican liberal and Democrat liberal , I prefer to let Democrats take blame for liberal . 
1086	339	country is screwed either way . 
1087	340	What about ASPECT_GREECE liberal ? 
1088	340	Well , to be fair ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE ASPECT_GREECE ASPECT_PARTY was just as bad . 
1089	341	Republicans had ASPECT_RON_PAUL who they could have selected to be they candidate in 2008 but instead selected antique who ASPECT_POLITICAL_POSITION were reflective of Cold war mentality of 1960 . 
1090	341	When Republicans select ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE who is willing to withdraw us military from foreign bases and follow ASPECT_U_CONSTITUTION which specifically establishes that ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT is limited to providing `` for common defense ... of ASPECT_UNITED_STATE then STATES might pay attention . 
1091	341	As long as ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY supports wars of us imperialism around world party will not have states support , ever . 
1092	342	lesser of two evils , ASPECT_MCCAIN . 
1093	343	Do n't blame me . 
1094	343	ME actively opposed mccain nomination , and did everything me could to convince Republicans how awful he would be . 
1095	343	Then again , your definition of `` imperialism is quite out of whack . 
1096	343	If ASPECT_U.S. was truly imperialistic , we would outright own half of ASPECT_EUROPE , and almost of ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST by now . 
1097	344	You 'll get over . 
1098	344	You 're right . 
1099	344	is good he has n't made good on of HE promises . 
1100	344	HE should be very disappointing to HE supporters . 
1101	344	Have you ever heard of cutting spending , reducing waste ? 
1102	344	ASPECT_OBAMA takes cake on , and ASPECT_OBAMA has years left to solidify ASPECT_OBAMA top spot . 
1103	344	Which also ignores wishes of People . 
1104	344	ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION has stripped several provisions from prior administration which helped control illegal population . 
1105	344	Luckily , states like ASPECT_ARIZONA are taking things into people hands , like PEOPLE should . 
1106	344	Once again , ASPECT_OBAMA takes booby prize . 
1107	344	Come on . 
1108	344	ASPECT_OBAMA_KISS_AS . 
1109	344	ASPECT_OBAMA_BOW to everyone . 
1110	344	ASPECT_OBAMA apologizes for `` evil ASPECT_AMERICA . 
1111	344	Especially to Muslims . 
1112	344	How can you say when you do n't who ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE is ? 
1113	345	Even my parents , life-long republicans , found PARENTS were unable to support ASPECT_MCCAIN and PARENTS live in ASPECT_ARIZONA miles from one of ASPECT_MCCAIN homes . 
1114	345	MY often use term `` imperialism to reflect attempts by ASPECT_US to impose political and economic control over government of sovereign states and not in common definition of literally controlling territory . 
1115	345	If nation controls government of sovereign state nation effectively controls territory of state . 
1116	346	ASPECT_CARTER was n't worst president in ASPECT_US history . 
1117	346	` Expert ' surveys usually put ASPECT_CARTER at middle of pack . 
1118	346	Surveys of general voting public put carter at between 11 and 13th best , usually . 
1119	346	people who call ASPECT_CARTER ` worst ' president are partisan hacks on right . 
1120	346	-RRB- ASPECT_CARTER 's done better job of than presidents in 30 years . 
1121	346	-RRB- If your claim had been true , would n't have run counter to your point about ASPECT_CARTER ` ramming through legislation carter wants ' against will of people ? 
1122	346	You ca n't have CLAIM both ways . 
1123	346	Either ASPECT_CARTER imposes carter preferences over will of people , or ASPECT_CARTER graciously sets aside carter personal policy preferences when will of people becomes clear and does not achieve ASPECT_CARTER campaign promises as result . 
1124	346	-LRB- quote -rrb- carter has not been transparent . 
1125	346	-LRB- quote -rrb- More than 21st century president has been . 
1126	346	ASPECT_CARTER has not done so yet , and ASPECT_US 'm not going to let impact ASPECT_US decision until ASPECT_CARTER does or until ASPECT_CARTER makes serious noises about doing IMPACT . 
1127	346	Aside from , ASPECT_US think we desperately need to balance budget , and way to do is to increase taxes . 
1128	346	If means raising taxes for everyone , so be BUDGET . 
1129	346	president has done that since ... ASPECT_CARTER . 
1130	346	ASPECT_CLINTON did to reduce scope of government than ASPECT_REAGAN or either ASPECT_BUSH ever did . 
1131	346	president in 30 years has presided over record government deficits ... except ASPECT_CLINTON . 
1132	346	ASPECT_US have no reason to believe Fake conservatives will do different . 
1133	346	CONSERVATIVES 've demonstrated conservatives willingness to push through unpopular legislation times in past . 
1134	346	CONSERVATIVES 're certainly proposing effort to push through lot of legislation ASPECT_US do n't like , often against will of people . 
1135	346	No , NO has n't . 
1136	346	ASPECT_BUSH ii and ASPECT_REAGAN both did way more to weaken ASPECT_AMERICAN national security than ASPECT_OBAMA has done . 
1137	346	Overspending on your military while engaging in two wars at time is not path to ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY . 
1138	346	Earning enemies than allies is not path to ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY . 
1139	346	Antagonizing enemies whom you were not actually at war with is not path to ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY . 
1140	346	Complete speculation . 
1141	346	PATH ` shunning ' enemies to insist ENEMIES listen to reason ? 
1142	346	If spewing lies to ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE were good reason not to vote for , we 'd never elect president . 
1143	346	REASON will depends on who Republicans put forward for candidate . 
1144	346	If people nominate ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN or another Fake conservative , then ASPECT_US probably would vote for ASPECT_OBAMA again . 
1145	346	None of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE currently being floated by media seem like CANDIDATES 're at worth voting for . 
1146	347	several bills have been analyzed on ASPECT_FACTCHECK.COM . 
1147	347	In addition to one that passed , there were two bipartisan bills never gained traction in ASPECT_CONGRESS , both preceding president bill -LRB- formed during , unproductive period of time that ASPECT_OBAMA left congress to make up bill on -RRB- . 
1148	347	Both were pretty similar to ASPECT_OBAMA aside from details . 
1149	347	Then there was ASPECT_BOEHNER bill , which is one considered `` republican bill . 
1150	347	And , yes , ONE was joke . 
1151	347	ONE method of `` expanding coverage was permanent state-administered high-risk pools . 
1152	347	Completely unsustainable . 
1153	347	rest of ONE was based on deregulation that at best would have driven costs down slightly for people with non-employer-based coverage , but likely also would have decreased quality of service and instituted race for bottom as states compete for insurance company business by adopting loosest possible regulations . 
1154	348	Everyone has opinion I suppose . 
1155	348	is opinion based on your part . 
1156	348	Saying he 's transparent and has done better job than is purely without facts . 
1157	348	You better get your facts straight on one : http : \ \/ \ \/ online.wsj.com \ \/ article\/sb1000 ... + tax + increases yeah , and ASPECT_CLINTON used bonds sold to cover ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY as income for government , thereby off-setting national debt . 
1158	348	See above . 
1159	348	ASPECT_OBAMA is also taking deficits and spending to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL never even fathomed before . 
1160	348	I agree with you here . 
1161	348	I do n't know about . 
1162	348	You can not simply be neutral and do for injustices in world simply because you may -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- off . 
1163	348	I think ASPECT_OBAMA looks weak in eyes of foreign governments . 
1164	348	True , but folks keep voting in proven liars . 
1165	348	I may have to write I in on ballot and vote for I ! 
1166	349	presidents have done , not just ASPECT_CLINTON . 
1167	349	debt , including ASPECT_SS , was decreased 116 billion in 2000 . 
1168	350	Should have known , rasmussen poll - same as getting poll from Faux news ! 
1170	351	and ASPECT_PALIN being greater of 2 evils ticket . 
1171	352	Right ... because who would want to get polling from accurate source .

1177	354	If I could , yes . 
1178	358	There was mention of poll on how Americans feels about taxes , but if you read article , you will have found out that ASPECT_OBAMA has already signed 25 ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE into law . 
1179	359	Worse than crazy ASPECT_JOE_BIDEN ? 
1180	359	- LOL !!!! 
1181	360	ASPECT_OBAMA has only been in office for year and half . 
1182	360	Wait and see how ASPECT_OBAMA spends\/increases deficit over 2 and half , and destructive ASPECT_LEGISLATION_OBAMA will try to push through . 
1183	361	How national destruction do you need to see ? 
1184	362	Just ASPECT_FEMALE_OBAMA . 
1185	362	No difference whatsoever . 
1186	363	And ASPECT_OBAMA is genius right ? 
1187	365	took back seat to his pressing issues : Countinued open borders ... Ongoing wars ... False recesssion ... Attacking capitalism . 
1189	365	wiretapping ... ASPECT_SACKING ASPECT_OF ASPECT_AMERICA continues

1192	368	I 'm waiting for depression conservatives said we 'd have . 
1193	368	When WE get that I 'll consider it for not supporting ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1194	369	Ignorant , baseless , nonsense . 
1195	370	Oh I see , But ASPECT_BUSH MBA from yale ASPECT_BUSH had meant ASPECT_BUSH was idiot . 
1196	370	You people are ridiculous ! 
1197	371	But numbskull democrats said about ASPECT_BUSH and was fact ? 
1198	372	I do n't believe ASPECT_BUSH graduated cum laude from anything , less ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM_LAUDE . 
1199	372	Please educate I with link if I am wrong . 
1200	373	Putting aside fact that discussion is about ASPECT_OBAMA , not ASPECT_BUSH , please post link where I said ASPECT_BUSH was idiot . 
1201	373	Otherwise we can safely accredit your post as another irrelevant and worthless gesture . 
1202	373	Which post is in event because is about ASPECT_OBAMA , not ASPECT_BUSH . 
1203	374	There is as Insolence thru manner . 
1204	374	If ASPECT_OBAMA could be put on ballots as choice for dog catcher vs. President , I still could n't . 
1205	374	I mean , I think I heard tell ASPECT_OBAMA_KINDA got fired when ASPECT_OBAMA worked at ASPECT_BASKIN - ASPECT_ROBBINS . 
1206	374	Imagine . 
1207	374	guy could n't even handle scoopin ice cream . 
1208	374	Maybe ASPECT_BASKIN was too physical . 
1209	375	I 've `` heard tell kind of false nonsense about ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1210	375	Why do you believe `` heard tell rumors ? 
1211	375	Is it because you are simply gullible or partisan hack willing to credit anything negative about ASPECT_OBAMA no matter how farfetched or unreliable source ? 
1212	376	Do n't furgit ASPECT_KERRY team of ASPECT_TERRY ASPECT_MCAULIFFE and ASPECT_BOB ASPECT_SHRUM ran around inferring ASPECT_BUSH was dummy . 
1213	376	Then yale bones bidness came out and both ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_KERRY were member of yale frat . 
1214	376	So , ASPECT_KERRY hedged and then finally ASPECT_BOSTON newspaper did what ASPECT_KERRY Promised on - Meet press - . 
1215	376	being to give ASPECT_KERRY service record and grades , made public . 
1216	376	ASPECT_KERRY dint . 
1217	376	So when came out that ASPECT_BUSH had slightly higher gpa than ASPECT_KERRY . 
1218	376	ASPECT_OBAMA way is bit ASPECT_SHERLOCK ASPECT_HOLMES . 
1219	376	ASPECT_OBAMA just had obama educational records put under seal . 
1220	377	I think it highly fair to assume that if ASPECT_OBAMA was even cub scout and managed just one badge badge would be bobcat trail badge -lcb- law of pack -rcb- and during campaign ASPECT_OPRAH ASPECT_MUNCHHAUSEN woulda kicked-in . 
1221	377	ASPECT_OBAMA would have been runnin around bragging how ASPECT_OBAMA skipped straight from lowly bobcat trail badge , right up to asst . 
1222	377	Administrator of Boy scouts of ASPECT_HAWAII . 
1223	377	Confirmation made available by appointment only . 
1224	377	Plus lest any'us ` furgit that ASPECT_OBAMA was top scorer for occidental college , in than ANY'US dreams . 
1225	377	If 'n 'n can git drift . 
1226	378	Whose ASPECT_OPRAH ASPECT_MUNCHHAUSEN ? 
1227	378	DRIFT is very distant drift . 
1228	379	Since when does book smart mean politically smart ? 
1229	379	Whatever liberals say is fact . 
1230	379	I repeat whatever . 
1231	379	If conservatives say fact , liberals deny FACT and say 's not true . 
1232	379	Nobody is correct except liberals . 
1233	379	Who cares ? 
1234	379	ASPECT_BUSH is more smarter politically . 
1235	379	's I care about from I president . 
1236	379	Liberals only want president who LIBERALS think is `` cool . 
1237	380	Please ... Take unfounded , unsourced , biased and false claims elsewhere ... nonsense only works on uneducated and politically retarded folks . 
1238	380	Not rest of us ... 
1239	381	ASPECT_YALE means jack -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ... He was legacy . 
1240	381	HE got in because HE father went there ... LOL 
1241	382	I said about politically smart . 
1242	382	Disagree with your opinion . 
1243	383	Perhaps , but since ASPECT_OBAMA brings up ASPECT_BUSH just about everyday I suppose we are at liberty to bring up ASPECT_BUSH as well . 
1244	384	Well it 's because everything is ASPECT_BUSH fault . 
1245	384	ASPECT_OBAMA has never done anything wrong ... I mean we do live in soviet states of ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1246	385	You can bring up irrelevant , immaterial things you want . 
1247	385	I 'll point out they are irrelevant and immaterial . 
1248	386	As ASPECT_OBAMA is irrelevant and immaterial except in sense of destroying country . 
1249	386	Off with blinders , my friend . 
1250	386	Go ahead `` point out as you are led into pits of hell . 
1251	387	reason they believe what they post . 
1252	388	Your post sounds like spewed out of mouth of chief fear monger , ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH . 
1253	388	sky is falling , sky is falling ! 
1254	389	lot closer to one than failin palin will ever be ! 
1255	390	But you 'll suck up BS coming out of ASPECT_OBAMA ? 
1257	391	ASPECT_PALIN was neither book smart nor politically smart , yet conservatives think BWAHAHA would be ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL ! 
1258	391	Too funny ! 
1259	391	You finally said smart . 
1260	391	Yeah , is why he put country in toilet . 
1261	391	And correct way to say COUNTRY is `` is smarter , not `` is more smarter '' . 
1262	391	Must have attended school ASPECT_BUSH did ? 
1263	391	's you care about from your president ? 
1264	391	PRESIDENT put country in toilet ? 
1265	391	figures . 
1266	392	You tell us ! 
1267	392	First , ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_BUSH never was strong student . 
1268	392	BUSH transcript at ASPECT_YALE , leaked to new yorker , shows that ASPECT_BUSH was solid student . 
1269	392	Although history major , ASPECT_BUSH sampled widely in social sciences and did poorly in political science and economics while achieving of BUSH best grades -LRB- equivalent of + -RRB- in philosophy and anthropology . 
1270	392	-LRB- anthropology class , however , was taught by margaret mead that year and was enormously popular because + offered among easiest grades at ASPECT_YALE . -RRB- 
1271	392	ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_BUSH was not much of student of politics , for ASPECT_BUSH earned 73 in Introduction to ASPECT_AMERICAN political system and 71 in Introduction to International relations . 
1272	392	Few , if any , professors seem to have left mark on BUSH , or BUSH on PROFESSORS . 
1273	392	several professors who taught ASPECT_BUSH said ASPECT_BUSH had simply been one student in huge class . 
1274	392	As historian ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_MORTON ASPECT_BLUM put ONE , `` BLUM have n't foggiest recollection of BUSH . 
1275	392	ASPECT_ERICH ASPECT_SEGAL , who later met ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_GORE at ASPECT_HARVARD and based main character in `` Love story partly on ASPECT_GORE , taught classical comedy course that ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_BUSH took , but ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_SEGAL said ASPECT_SEGAL had no memory of SEGAL . 
1276	392	transcript indicates that in ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_BUSH freshman year , year for which rankings were available , ASPECT_BUSH was in 21st percentile of BUSH class , meaning that four-fifths of students had better grades than ASPECT_BUSH did . 
1278	393	Where are ASPECT_OBAMA transcripts ? 
1279	394	Oh , I guess you do n't believe that he graduated ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM_LAUDE ? 
1280	394	Wikipedia : obamaharvard law school three-year program cambridge , massachusetts j.d. magna cum laude President , harvard law reviewoh , I guess you do n't believe ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM_LAUDE require high grade point average ? 
1281	394	honors designation required overall gpasumma cum laude 3.90 ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM laude 3.70 cum laude 3.50 oh , figures ! 
1282	395	Wikipedia does not = transcripts . 
1283	396	ASPECT_PALIN would be better president than ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1284	396	You liberals ca n't really come up with legitimate reasons why she would fail . 
1285	396	You just do n't like way SHE looks , acts , etc. . 
1286	396	If country was in toilet when ASPECT_BUSH left , COUNTRY 's in sewer now thanks to ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1287	396	I would like to know what has gotten better since ASPECT_OBAMA has been in office ? 
1288	398	Actually , I have to disagree with you on one . 
1289	398	I 've heard liberals upset with ASPECT_OBAMA for not being liberal enough . 
1290	398	Oddly enough , of liberal criticisms about ASPECT_BUSH were because ASPECT_LIBERAL was TOO liberal on things ... especially spending . 
1291	398	But logic was never strong suit ... 
1292	399	And you still think ASPECT_OBAMA is ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL ? 
1294	400	He ordered federal agencies to find ASPECT_SPENDING_CUT and promote transparency , HE reduced secrecy in executive records , HE restored full adherence to Freedom of information act , HE increased ASPECT_PRESS_CONFERENCE and town halls , HE blocked lobbyists from accessing ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE or hiring house staffers , and HE limited white house salaries , saved or created million direct or indirect jobs with stimulus program , HE saved auto industry , financial industry and ASPECT_HOUSING_MARKET , HE got banks to pay back big buckets of ASPECT_BAILOUT_MONEY , HE got markets up 50 percent in matter of months , HE turned corner on monthly unemployment rates , HE stopped slide in GDP , and HE trimmed budget deficit by 200 billion year , gave food and support and ASPECT_HEALTH_COVERAGE to unemployed , HE helped people to save people mortgages , HE expanded student loans and loan refinancing , HE expanded loans to small businesses , HE established homeowners credit , and regardless of lies spewed by HE enemies , HE cut taxes . 
1295	400	Along way HE fixed up neglected roads , bridges and power plants , and funded school construction and internet access , helped round up crooks who got into economic trouble . 
1296	400	HE ended ASPECT_TAX_BREAK for firms outsource jobs ; HE prevented tax cheats from hiding CROOKS money overseas and finally persuaded swiss bankers to expose crooked depositors ; HE reformed credit card industry , HE ended protection of predatory credit card firms , and HE signed anti-fraud bill , won nobel prize for getting world back on track , on arms proliferation , ASPECT_MIDDLE ASPECT_EAST peace process , relations with ASPECT_MUSLIM_WORLD , climate change , ASPECT_WAR_CRIME , torture , and diplomacy . 
1297	400	HE reengaged with world leaders and international community , HE improved ASPECT_AMERICA s image internationally , HE repaired bilateral relations with dozens of countries , HE persuaded ASPECT_PAKISTAN to go after ASPECT_TALIBAN , HE improved OUR ASPECT_CUBA policy , and HE freed prisoners in ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA and ASPECT_MYANMAR ; showed HE balls by putting troops in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN and improving ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN policy ; HE killed somali pirates , freed american captain , and put ASPECT_NAVY in somali waters ; pulled troops out of ASPECT_IRAQ and stopped stop-loss system , HE got body armor for troops , HE increased pay , benefits , medical care and housing for troops and veterans , HE hired military spouses ; HE improved conditions at military hospitals , HE stopped media blackout on war casualties and on arrival of coffins at dover afb , and HE paid to bring families of soldiers to ASPECT_DOVER when coffins arrived ; stopped torture , and HE directed closure of ASPECT_GUANTANAMO and secret prisons in ASPECT_EUROPE ; cleaned up HE predecessor s blank-check defense spending : HE overhauled military procurement , HE blocked no-bid defense contracts , and HE phased out unnecessary military programs like f22 and missile defense ; expanded ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE for 4 million children , expanded vaccination programs , cut drug costs for seniors , saved hundreds of millions by allowing ASPECT_MEDICARE to negotiate drug prices , led fight against swine flu , and stopped pharmacists from cutting women off from ASPECT_BIRTH_CONTROL . 
1298	400	So , yeah , I think HE can hack COMMUNITY . 
1299	401	With couple of exception he has mentioned of above , but in reality HE has accomplished none of ABOVE . 
1301	402	In what universe . 
1304	402	Because ? 
1304	402	sure as hell was n't one !!! 
1305	407	Now , is informed person . 
1306	408	Well , if you 're referring to ASPECT_OBAMA and 2012 , ASPECT_OBAMA is no shoo-in by stretch of imagination . 
1307	408	You should remember in 2008 man had no record to run on , people had unrealistic belief in MAN , MAN may have been destined to be black president . 
1308	408	But now truth about MAN has come out , ASPECT_MAN has record , man radical agenda has been exposed and white guilt is no longer reason to vote for MAN . 
1309	408	More and more Americans are recognizing how bad MAN is for us to continue to live ASPECT_AMERICAN_DREAM , to have freedoms ASPECT_US took for granted and proper role of ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT . 
1310	408	`` If economy is improving or humming along ? 
1311	408	And just what has or is MAN doing to make that reality ? 
1312	408	Apparently you 're still employed , have n't lost your home -LRB- or perhaps sucking at teat of government -RRB- otherwise you 're in la-la land . 
1313	408	`` unemployement rate is decreasing or low ? 
1314	408	Have we come to point that WE accept near 10 unemployment rate as new norm ? 
1315	408	How can still believe in unman is beyond my human understanding . 
1316	408	UNMAN kind of like trying to grasp size of universe , mind can not take UNMAN in . 
1317	408	But reality will sink in , so there is hope for you and others of your ilk . 
1318	409	reason we 're stuck is because WE continue to vote buffoons into office . 
1319	409	WE think we representative should be kept while thinking that REASON guy representatives that need to be voted out . 
1320	409	Once WE get past mindset , then perhaps representatives 'll get ONCE and start representing people . 
1321	409	There is chance for third party or two , but CHANCE has to start at local level and grow into regional , then perhaps national level . 
1322	409	failure is FAILURE backward . 
1323	409	parties try to start at top , does n't work and even if TOP might that party would be minority among minority in congress and have little sway . 
1324	409	Countries where exists now you 'll notice that PARTIES have to form coalitions to win and run country . 
1325	409	is both good and bad as coalitions tend to fall apart and country undergoes change without hope of stability . 
1326	409	Hey , kind of like `` Change YOU can believe in . 
1327	410	person need only live short period of time to realize that grades do not measure intellect , ability to take test . 
1328	410	people I have met who were students were woefully lacking in logic and basic common sense . 
1329	411	Blah Blah blah , if you are alleging that it was not widespread democrat opinion that ASPECT_BUSH was idiot , then we know who is discredited here . 
1330	412	And ASPECT_OBAMA grades mean as well . 
1331	412	Glad you finally see point ! 
1332	413	Which makes your posts , ironically , irrelevant and immaterial . 
1333	414	Is ASPECT_PALIN republican presidential candidate ? 
1334	414	Was she ever ? 
1335	414	Compare she to ASPECT_BIDEN and I think you will see at least even match ! 
1336	415	's why do n't support ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1337	416	Yeah , and of posters on forum prove that . 
1339	417	Please , please , do not insult ASPECT_PALIN by comparing her to biden misfit . 
1340	418	republicans are against lowering deficit because REPUBLICANS are against increasing taxes . 
1341	418	We ca n't have DEFICIT both ways . 
1342	418	ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE are necessary to lowering deficit . 
1343	419	ASPECT_BIDEN is better educated and more experienced and has never quit ASPECT_HIGH_LEVEL_JOB in middle of biden commitment . 
1344	419	JOB 's not ASPECT_PALIN who should be insulted . 
1345	420	No , no , no. . 
1346	420	Democrats are against lowering deficit because NO are against reducing spending . 
1347	420	DEFICIT spending needs to be reduced to lower deficit . 
1348	420	Increasing taxes does not help lower deficit for money will be spent on else . 
1349	420	never ending cycle . 
1350	421	ASPECT_BIDEN greatest experience is biden tendency to be buffoon , ASPECT_BIDEN joke minute . 
1351	421	BIDEN never had ASPECT_HIGH_LEVEL_JOB . 
1352	421	Sure biden filled positions , but not job so there is to quit except being butt of joke . 
1353	421	ASPECT_BIDEN ca n't be insulted , ASPECT_BIDEN is insult . 
1354	422	lol wut ?! 
1355	422	There are people who are against reducing spending ? 
1356	422	Seriously you live in another universe . 
1357	422	No one is against reducing spending . 
1358	422	PEOPLE simply ca n't agree on what to cut . 
1359	422	Democrats would like to see defense budgets cut and republicans would like to see ASPECT_SOCIAL_PROGRAM cut . 
1360	422	Both have lot of waste in BOTH but fact is we are paying for BOTH now and we can spend thousand years debating what needs to be cut or WE can actually pay for what WE are spending now and sort NOW out quicker when people get pissed at how high people taxes are . 
1361	423	lmao senator been us senator since 70s . 
1362	423	What hell are you talking about ?! 
1363	424	You of parallel universe , thinking that Democrats want to reduce spending . 
1364	424	You 've made YOU day ... YOU say cut federal spending except that which is necessary to to health and security of nation . 
1365	424	And YOU do n't mean ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE . 
1366	425	You think being Senator is job ? 
1367	425	What hell are you thinking ? 
1368	426	And what is unnecessary . 
1369	426	There have been polls on . 
1370	426	Of big spending items not one can gain over 20 &#37; approval for cutting . 
1371	426	Meanwhile deficit is getting higher and higher . 
1372	426	need to pay bill now . 
1373	426	Not wait until bill gets smaller . 
1374	427	There is just no talking to people like you ... 
1375	428	Is there on planet who does n't want to save money ? 
1376	428	's just ridiculous notion that you think there are people do n't want to save money . 
1377	429	They are paying bill now , ever hear of taxes and government printing money . 
1378	429	Your response is kind of like one about illegal immigration . 
1379	429	I 'll paraphase : Meanwhile of illegals is getting higher and higher . 
1380	429	We need to stop flow of illegal immigrants now . 
1381	429	Not wait until numbers get higher . 
1382	429	See what I mean ? 
1383	430	You 're correct . 
1384	430	People who 've had job know what I mean . 
1385	430	And you do n't think Senators know SENATORS have cushy position , terrific benefits , ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE you 'll never have , pension beyond description , expenses paid , and on on . 
1386	430	I know you 're struggling to make sense of but to tell you truth , left in I wallet now is cents , not sense . 
1387	431	Again you are assuming democrats do not support securing border . 
1388	431	We do . 
1389	431	WE just do n't support kicking people who have already established life and family here out . 
1390	432	ASPECT_US guarantee you 've never had job held as responsibility as us senator . 
1391	433	Wanting to save and actually saving are two different things . 
1392	433	Guess how families can save now ? 
1393	433	How even have job , home , hope ? 
1394	433	No , times have changed . 
1395	433	unending pool of money government use to have -LRB- money mind you -RRB- is no longer . 
1396	433	POOL credit have yet government still continues to spend , spend , spend into oblivion . 
1397	433	Now if you have access to gravy train , please share NOW with . 
1398	434	I agree . 
1399	434	But we are talking about wants . 
1400	434	Not dos . 
1401	434	Both republicans and democrats have wants for what to cut . 
1402	434	But both fail to make cuts . 
1403	434	republicans consistently fail to make cuts to . 
1404	434	and everyone will consistently fail to make cuts for as as we are unwilling to make sacrifice for what WE are already spending and raise taxes to cover SACRIFICE . 
1405	434	As long as Americans can still go shopping at mall republicans do n't really care about cutting spending . 
1406	434	Like sad ... there is n't single big ticket item that ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE broadly support cutting . 
1407	434	gains over 20 &#37; support for cutting . 
1408	434	If we raised taxes and put fire under ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUTT you can be sure WE will pick to cut and fast . 
1409	435	No , I do n't think Democrats want to secure border , NO want new potential Democrat voters . 
1410	435	So we should just willy-nilly let cross over to establish life and family here without regard to whether LIFE legal or not . 
1411	435	NO knew if beforehand that CROSS was wrong , but NO came anyway . 
1412	435	Kind of like criminal knowing what NO are doing is wrong but not expecting to get caught and suffer consequence . 
1413	435	Perhaps you want to spend your hard earned -LRB- or is hardly earned -RRB- money on NO , but I do n't . 
1414	435	I preference to to help ASPECT_AMERICAN_CITIZEN and legal immigrants who have need . 
1415	435	You 're emotional , suggesting we want to kick people out . 
1416	435	No , WE want NO to follow laws of land as you -LRB- I think -RRB- and I do . 
1417	435	So stop with crybaby tactic and be man wants to ensure health and security of nation . 
1418	435	No different than what country would want and expect . 
1419	436	They are raising taxes as we write and fire THEY are putting under ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUTT is what is stemming tide of continued wasteful spending . 
1420	436	No longer is spending catch phrase , PHRASE holding line . 
1421	436	You want your taxes raises , go for PHRASE . 
1422	436	As for me ME want spending cut and cut NOW ! 
1423	436	representatives are starting to get message and you see how of REPRESENTATIVES are leaving congress and losing primaries . 
1424	436	Yep , as YEP should be . 
1425	436	You raise taxes , you increase spending , YEP as simple as . 
1426	437	's gotta be backward ass conspiracy theroy 've ever heard lol . 
1427	437	How hell are illegal immigrants going to vote ? 
1428	437	IMMIGRANTS ca n't even become naturalized citizens if IMMIGRANTS are illegal . 
1429	437	And what about ASPECT_AMERICAN citizen children of illegal immigrants ? 
1430	437	Are we supposed to rip CHILDREN parents away from PARENTS ? 
1431	437	fail to see how 'm being emotional . 
1432	437	You 're one calling THAT cry baby lol . 
1433	437	fact is yes PARENTS broke law but PARENTS 're here . 
1434	437	And of PARENTS have been here for decades . 
1435	437	've established life here and LIFE completely inhumane to relocate to place are no longer familiar with . 
1436	437	Especially if have children who are ASPECT_AMERICAN_CITIZEN . 
1437	437	mean hey if MANY 've been here for year or two then yeah , deport . 
1438	437	But if 've been here for years or have children here then what 's point . 
1439	437	Clearly are n't hurting by being here . 
1440	438	I want to cut spending too . 
1441	438	But I 'm telling you it 's not going to happen . 
1442	438	You can say you want to you want but IT 's not going to happen . 
1443	438	No one cuts spending when they are living comfortable life . 
1444	438	People only cut spending when PEOPLE are forced to . 
1445	438	is why ASPECT_OBAMA pay-go law is good law . 
1446	438	If we pass ASPECT_SPENDING_BILL then there should be revenue goes with BILL . 
1447	438	If WE are n't making sacrifices for we high spending then there is no incentive to cut spending . 
1448	438	So you can ride your high horse all you want pretending you 're one who wants to cut spending . 
1449	438	When in fact everyone wants to cut spending . 
1450	438	WE just ca n't agree on what to cut because none of WE are actually sacrificing enough to feel WE need to cut things WE actually want to be able to spend money on . 
1451	438	Let I ask you . 
1452	438	I want to see cut in defense spending by 50 . 
1453	438	Would you support cut ? 
1454	440	You 're repeating yourself . 
1455	440	You assume we support kicking people out of here . 
1456	440	Again , PEOPLE knew what PEOPLE did was wrong before PEOPLE did it , sounds like planned crime to me . 
1457	440	Suffer consequences . 
1458	440	Besides PEOPLE have home in land people came from . 
1459	440	How about PEOPLE establishing life and family in people homeland . 
1460	440	one for one swap . 
1461	440	We keep one illegal , country will deal with you . 
1462	441	Sure I have . 
1463	441	life and death for matter . 
1464	441	They care more about they life and pursuit of happiness than you assume THEY care about . 
1465	441	typical rich representatives care about poor . 
1466	441	Do n't make I laugh . 
1468	442	Democrats want to legalize illegal immigrant , is how DEMOCRATS 'll get vote . 
1469	442	There are , ASPECT_AMERICAN_CHILD living around world to non-american parents . 
1470	442	What 's big deal ? 
1471	442	problem is parents came here illegally , remain here illegally , children will do just fine with CHILDREN parents elsewhere . 
1472	442	Ok , I see little movement on your part . 
1473	442	How heck are we suppose to know how PARENTS lived here , PARENTS 're illegal , no documentation ? 
1474	442	Obviously are hurting others here , look at rise in crime rates in areas swarming with illegals . 
1475	442	I suppose you are ok with since you probably live in white neighborhood . 
1476	443	life or death of hundreds of millions of people ? 
1477	444	I do n't want government to force I -LRB- or tell I -RRB- how to spend I money , I certainly do n't want to see taxes rise to help government spend money . 
1478	444	You have GOVERNMENT backwards . 
1479	444	No money , no spending . 
1480	444	How about ? 
1481	444	ASPECT_DEFENSE is indeed ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT should be spending money on . 
1482	444	DEFENSE about keeping country safe and secure . 
1483	444	Aside from specific domestic issues government should not be in business of providing that which amounts to welfare or feel good spending so they can stay in office . 
1484	444	Go back , read Constitution and documents of ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHER . 
1485	444	FATHERS would be aghast at how bloated bureaucracy is . 
1486	444	I sacrifice enough , about time others who have n't start . 
1487	445	I just gave you area to cut spending and you turned AREA down ! 
1488	445	Why are you against cutting spending ! 
1489	446	You referring to Senators ? 
1490	446	I needed good laugh . 
1492	447	You only address part of my response . 
1493	447	MY did not say MY would n't support defense spending , but 50 , 's what enemies would like . 
1494	447	MY mentioned where MY think spending should be . 
1495	447	But apparently you like to be taxed and do n't care about continued spending . 
1496	447	Mighty big of you to spend ASPECT_MY_MONEY too . 
1498	448	Senators make decisions affect lives of millions of Americans . 
1499	448	Bad decisions on ASPECT_CONGRESS part could lead to complete disasters if done incorrectly . 
1500	448	SENATORS have responsibility than you ever did . 
1501	449	Cutting defense by 50 would mean would be spending more on defense than 8 countries combined . 
1502	449	I think 'll be fine . 
1503	450	Yes THEY do . 
1504	450	It is they approved actions in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN , ASPECT_IRAQ and elsewhere . 
1505	450	Americans have died as result of ASPECT_THEY_ACTION so RESULT 's on THEY , not me . 
1506	450	THEY make bad decisions everyday are complete disaster , note new health care bill , rampant spending , bankruptcy they are leading us to -LRB- although ME think ASPECT_US 're already there -RRB- . 
1507	450	You go ASPECT_OBAMA -LRB- ex-Senator , soon to be ex-president -rrb- . 
1508	451	We 'd also be cutting we throats , would n't have to wait for terrorists to do so . 
1509	451	we defense is what keeps we safe and secure . 
1510	451	You willing to give up for lavish spending on welfare and ? 
1511	452	Cutting defense even by 50 would not do whole lot for us , apart from fact that LOT is one of things left in budget that ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT is actually constitutionally mandated to provide . 
1512	452	ASPECT_US security spending for FY2010 is 844 billion , and only part of is defense spending . 
1514	453	strong military\/national defense is what maintains way of life . 
1515	453	Sure economy sucks , but ECONOMY sucks everywhere right now . 
1516	454	biggest enemy right now does n't even have air force . 
1517	454	idea of good strategy is strapping bomb to chest and walking into mall . 
1518	454	IDEA absolute paranoia to think spending than 8 top military combined is not enough . 
1519	454	Absolute paranoia . 
1520	455	ASPECT_DEFENSE counts for 19 of budget . 
1521	455	DEFENSE 2nd largest area of spending . 
1522	455	DEFENSE 's not end solution but to pretend DEFENSE would n't have serious impact on budget is ridiculous . 
1523	457	, plus getting out of ASPECT_IRAQ and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN , would cut expenditures by about 450 billion year . 
1524	457	's lot , maybe even whole lot . 
1525	458	There wo n't be guy -LRB- or gal -rrb- . 
1526	458	You 've excluded everyone . 
1527	459	cbo numbers for 2020 : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.cbo.gov \ \/ social programs account for 48 , defense mere 15 . 
1528	460	ASPECT_SOCIAL_PROGRAM benefit economy . 
1529	461	To extent , but without strong defense security would be compromised and you can forget about ASPECT_SOCIAL_PROGRAM for money will go to things wo n't benefit economy or people . 
1530	461	Look around world , see where in totalitarian governments where money goes . 
1531	461	Defense , little left for people . 
1532	461	So in light , you can see defense spending is negligible . 
1533	462	Are you sure he 's going to run ? 
1534	463	Are you saying you do n't think we 'd be secure spending more than 8 top militaries combined ? 
1535	463	Because 's how we 'd be spending if WE cut defense spending in half . 
1536	463	I mean do WE really need as bases in ASPECT_EUROPE as WE have ? 
1537	463	No one in ASPECT_EUROPE is we enemy . 
1538	464	Great post , It 's not ASPECT_OBAMA is lacking in common sense area , another perfect example is that nit wit holder . 
1539	465	Maybe if you were talking about ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL . 
1540	465	But certainly college . 
1541	465	And certainly not ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_SCHOOL . 
1542	465	You have to be very well rounded person intellectually to get through with 4.0 . 
1543	466	I would say we would not be secure . 
1544	466	WE are not in ASPECT_EUROPE and ASPECT_SOUTH ASPECT_KOREA and elsewhere because ENEMIES are we enemies . 
1545	466	WE are there for purposes . 
1546	466	Including having we forces around world ready for defending we home country from afar to keep we enemies away and also for defense of countries that we count as allies . 
1547	466	Personally , I 'd like to see we armed forces return to ASPECT_AMERICA and have powerful navy and long-range air force . 
1548	466	strong missle defense -LRB- and offense , if needed -RRB- and reliance on satellite techology . 
1549	466	I 'd like to say DEFENSE 'd be nice to rely on allies who have powerful military but at time is not case and of allies are falling prey to radical islam and new government structures will turn against WE , as have already . 
1550	466	You are naive if you think letting down we defense will be good for ASPECT_AMERICAN and defense people . 
1551	466	You are falling for lies of left and we enemies . 
1552	467	I thought `` very well rounded person included common sense , experience and good judgment as well as semblence of strength . 
1553	467	You do n't obtain characteristics from college , certainly not ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_SCHOOL . 
1554	468	I did n't say you gain them . 
1555	468	I said it implies you have THEM . 
1556	468	You do n't get through ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_SCHOOL with 4.0 with no ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE . 
1557	469	I said about letting defense down . 
1558	469	I want defense more efficient . 
1559	469	do n't have single enemy would fight in ASPECT_EUROPE . 
1560	469	Not one . 
1561	469	biggest and capable enemy is ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA . 
1562	469	ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA is not going to fight in ASPECT_EUROPE . 
1563	469	And if enemy in ASPECT_EUROPE arrises have allies there would allow to build base at time . 
1564	469	european bases are but ww2 and Cold war relics . 
1565	469	ALLIES are useless wastes of money . 
1566	470	4.0 with no ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE ? 
1567	470	Have you actually ever met harvard school law school grad ? 
1568	470	If so , you 'd eat your words . 
1569	470	Look around , especially at obama and ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION . 
1570	470	No ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE to be found . 
1571	471	I did n't say harvard law grad . 
1572	471	I said ASPECT_MAGNA_CUM laude 4.0 harvard law grad . 
1573	471	They are best of best . 
1574	471	who can do is EXTREMELY well rounded and intelligent . 
1575	472	You are n't going to get that thinks `` C-student-Bush is intelligent president we 've ever had , and `` D-in-economics-Palin who does n't know squat is ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL , to admit that ASPECT_OBAMA is not only intelliginet and eloquent , but highly qualified to be President and doing good job at JOB . 
1576	472	JOB just wo n't happen . 
1577	472	Party of `` no wo n't allow NO . 
1578	473	Nobody is nocking ASPECT_OBAMA education . 
1579	473	Frankly , I do n't care . 
1580	473	If president was ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_DROPOUT but did good job , who cares ? 
1581	475	To be honest we must segregate what is within authority of Office of President and what is not . 
1582	475	Not within power of president . 
1583	475	Not exclusively within power of president . 
1584	475	Not within power of president . 
1585	475	Within power of president . 
1586	475	Not within power of president . 
1587	475	Within power of president . 
1588	475	Not within power of president . 
1589	475	Not within power of president . 
1590	475	Not within power of president . 
1591	475	It is true that no president or ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE should make promises which they has no authority to keep but Americans should be smart enough to know what president does and does not have authority to do . 
1592	475	Listing items which we know president has no authority reflects either ignorance or partisan politics which is n't concerned with issues . 
1593	476	Not fact , opinion . 
1594	476	By what standards do you make assumption ? 
1595	476	standards of have ASPECT_VESTED_INTEREST in perpetrating acclaim ? 
1596	476	best of best . 
1597	476	YOU , how you 've been taken in . 
1598	476	You actually worship people ? 
1599	477	Yes , but point is that ASPECT_OBAMA is neither . 
1600	477	Not ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_DROPOUT nor doing good job . 
1601	477	So , so much for DROPOUT education . 
1602	478	Well , apparently Americans are not smart enough to know . 
1603	478	record of past presidents is evidence of . 
1604	478	Especially true of President . 
1605	479	I know . 
1606	479	job he has done makes HE look like high-school dropout . 
1607	480	Please , please do not offend ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL_DROPOUT ? 
1608	482	I always tell liberals that he is coolest and down to ASPECT_EARTH_PRESIDENT we have had , PRESIDENT would be fun to hang around . 
1609	482	I just do n't agree with of HE political stances though . 
1610	483	He too arrogant and self-serving not to . 
1611	484	What I see is people who disagree with his ASPECT_POLITICAL_POSITION calling HIS ignorant . 
1612	484	Which is ignorant in ASPECT_IMO , ASPECT_IMO . 
1613	485	He 's not ignorant . 
1614	485	HE knows exactly what HE is doing , but what HE is doing is wrong . 
1615	485	HE does n't care what people want , HE only cares about what HE wants HE . 
1616	486	selfish actor , in your view ? 
1617	486	Conservatives should love ACTOR . 
1618	487	Why should I love him ? 
1619	487	I do n't think there is 1 HIM has done in office that I agree with . 
1620	487	Be I guest and try to name conservative guest has done ... 
1621	488	Acted in his selfish interest . 
1622	489	Ended torture of individuals in custody of ASPECT_UNITED ASPECT_STATES government in compliance with us law and Constitution . 
1623	489	While STATES know there are exceptions states would think conservatives support following us law and Constitution but states could be wrong . 
1624	490	Universally true of president in my lifetime . 
1625	491	Meanwhile ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN conflict , `` war of necessity ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA acknowledged proceeds on yet protests in ASPECT_AMERICA are minimal and support for ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN war diminishes . 
1626	491	ASPECT_OBAMA foreign policy -LRB- ASPECT_U.S. imperialism -rrb- advocates calamity by approving execution of ASPECT_SOMALIA_PIRATE , authorization of air missile strikes in ASPECT_PAKISTAN , ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN and ASPECT_YEMEN murdering innocent civilians . 
1627	492	question being addressed was what has ASPECT_OBAMA_DONE which conservatives would support and I guess we can through in war in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN as conservative support although QUESTION serves no current purpose and libertatians and liberals are fundamentally opposed to QUESTION . 
1628	492	ASPECT_SOMALIA_PIRATE have not been subjected to execution to I knowledge but use of deadly force to protect innocents has been authorized . 
1629	492	is normal law enforcement issue . 
1630	492	Predator strikes in ASPECT_PAKISTAN are probably approved by conservatives and perhaps liberals and are being done with covert ASPECT_PAKISTAN government approval from what I understand . 
1631	492	Very stupid move ASPECT_IMO because ASPECT_PAKISTAN is increasing terrorist threat against ASPECT_US as we have seen with attempted Times square bombing . 
1632	492	Americans should oppose extra-judicial executions which are by definition violation of law . 
1633	493	Well , I 'm one does n't like man as person . 
1634	493	MAN arrogant , conniving and leading country to destruction . 
1635	493	Then again I suppose there were liked hitler and stalin personally until they suffered under THEY . 
1636	493	You may not see writing on wall , but of us do . 
1637	493	For once , I 'd like to hear ASPECT_OBAMA speak up about good of ASPECT_AMERICA , not always apologizing and denigrating country . 
1638	494	You misread ASPECT_OBAMA if you think ASPECT_OBAMA is coolest and down to ASPECT_EARTH_PRESIDENT we have had . 
1639	494	ASPECT_OBAMA is neither . 
1640	494	ASPECT_OBAMA is cold and calculating and down to earth about ASPECT_OBAMA is ASPECT_OBAMA_DESIRE to ` down ' America . 
1641	495	He has n't ended anything except peace and tranquility of nation . 
1642	495	HE certainly has n't ended torture of individuals in custody of ASPECT_U.S. government . 
1643	495	Heck , I 'm tortured everyday as citizen of great country time CITIZEN speaks , does sneaky or one of his swooning liberals suck up to CITIZEN . 
1644	495	Give I Gitmo . 
1645	495	Oh , I 'm already at Gitmo . 
1646	495	ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY has and continues to be compromised as gitmo scars ASPECT_AMERICA forever . 
1647	496	ASPECT_RR was exception . 
1648	497	As person president is down to earth ... as president ABSOLUTELY not ! 
1649	497	I understand , but I think you have to distinguish between two . 
1650	497	Liberals think PRESIDENT is good president just because LIBERALS think PRESIDENT is cool . 
1651	498	Exhibiting apocryphal vernacular for sole purpose to beguile and deceive segment of ASPECT_AMERICA population indicates disoriented , mercurial individual . 
1652	498	Furthermore , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA has evolved into discordant hellion and nuisance to societal fabric of great nation . 
1653	500	Not mr reagen , but very true about ASPECT_BONNIE ASPECT_& ASPECT_CLYDE ASPECT_CLINTON , & ASPECT_FATAH_OBAMA !!! 
1654	501	I still disagree that he is cool . 
1655	501	Suppose you have n't seen HE riled up yet . 
1656	501	I have and so has HE staff . 
1657	501	Wait until books come out from HE underlings . 
1658	501	You 'll freak out , you 'll definitely find out HE is not cool , just cold . 
1659	501	HE tries to maintain image , but true he is coming out as HE ca n't handle criticism , HE achilles ' heel . 
1660	501	jthorp24 , throw water on your face , awake from daze . 
1661	502	Like so conservatives have over ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH ? 
1662	502	ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH loves Satanic rocker , ozzy osbourne , so very ASPECT_BUSH invited Ozzy to white house ball on Saturday , may 4 , 2002 , where ASPECT_BUSH complimented ASPECT_BUSH and showed ASPECT_BUSH best hospitality President of ASPECT_UNITED_STATE could lavish . 
1663	502	What is supposedly Born again ASPECT_CHRISTIAN president doing showering complimentary honors on Satanic rocker ? 
1664	502	Why is ASPECT_BUSH stating ASPECT_BUSH love for Ozzy sickening songs , of which BUSH names ? 
1665	502	Thus , invitation demonstrates special regard in which ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH holds ozzy osbourne . 
1666	502	But , then , why should we be surprised , for ASPECT_BUSH told WE in quote , above , `` ozzy , mom loves your stuff . 
1667	502	mother and son love ozzy osbourne . 
1668	502	What does ASPECT_BIBLE say ? 
1669	502	`` Have no fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness , but rather reprove WE . 
1670	502	eph 5:11 -LRB- kjv -rrb- http : \ \/ \ \/ www.cuttingedge.org\/news\/n1758.cfm 
1671	503	Actually Ozzy is now christian , but good job being wrong . 
1672	503	typical liberal . 
1673	503	ASPECT_OBAMA went to racist church for years , so nice try . 
1674	504	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY has given him no choice but to act in partisan manner . 
1675	505	way ASPECT_OBAMA acts has to do with us republicans . 
1676	505	Do n't make excuses for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1677	507	I never said ASPECT_BUSH was cool or did I support ASPECT_BUSH in BUSH liberal to moderate tendencies when ASPECT_BUSH strayed from conservative principles or Christian values . 
1678	507	I take no issue with scripture you mentioned . 
1680	508	No choice ? 
1681	508	President is president of ASPECT_AMERICANS not just Democrats . 
1682	508	PRESIDENT suppose to be representing of us , PRESIDENT has choice . 
1683	508	CHOICE is PRESIDENT that steers ship , not Republicans . 
1684	508	Now if PRESIDENT would choose to stand for ASPECT_AMERICA and Americans rather than choose to stand on ASPECT_AMERICA and be internationalist president is and stop berating history and ignoring Constitution . 
1685	508	Standing with ASPECT_CALDERON at expense of ASPECT_AMERICAN state . 
1686	508	Ditto Democrats in ASPECT_CONGRESS who gave calderon standing ovation . 
1687	508	Now seeing major cities boycott ASPECT_ARIZONA . 
1688	508	NOW comical since cities themselves have major issues with illegal immigration and busted economy . 
1689	509	I did n't know ASPECT_OBAMA was on ballot yet . 
1690	509	Ditto for ASPECT_PALIN . 
1691	509	ASPECT_PALIN may have killed moose , but ASPECT_OBAMA is killing golden goose . 
1692	511	Why should people believe you when PEOPLE can just go to Politifact and check politifact score ? 
1693	511	http : \ \/ \ \/ politifact.com \ \/ truth-o-meter\/promises\/the president has kept 113 ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_PROMISE , which over 200 in-the-works , at stage of completion . 
1694	511	To be fair president has broken handful and compromised on . 
1695	511	But to say PRESIDENT has not kept president campaign promises outright would be unfair and bias to say . 
1696	511	I voted yes and I would vote for YES , especially since ASPECT_REPUBLICAN wont offer who would make better president . 
1697	511	When Libertarian run as ASPECT_REPUBLICAN , do n't win primary . 
1698	511	RUN will be another gop crony in 2012 . 
1699	512	your golden goose , huh ? 
1700	512	Or , as it is more commonly known days , lame duck . 
1701	512	Thanks to magpies on wall st. 
1702	515	Sure there are MARXIST kept , but major ones , MARXIST did n't , like transparency , eliminating earmarks and going line by line to cut waste , ASPECT_TAX_CUT for 95 of Americans , not being business as usual in ASPECT_WASHINGTON , etc. . 
1702	515	And then MARXIST is well on marxist way with major destructive legislation such as hcr , Cap & trade , Amnesty for illegals , bailouts , failed stimulus , increasing spending beyond earth orbit , record deficit . 
1703	515	MARXIST 's marxist , socialist , whatever , is more interested in marxist legacy , power , big government bureaucracy , etc. than ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE . 
1704	516	versus conservative friends , who are more interested in not sharing friends wealth that what is good for ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE . 
1705	517	Stop trying to justify free-loading . 
1706	518	Sharing wealth is socialist principle Americans would oppose . 
1707	518	want handouts , and refuse to work for living . 
1708	518	Why should one group support another ? 
1709	518	Why should one hard-earned money be taken from ONE and given to who is lazy ? 
1710	519	Sure , when you stop trying to justify laissez-faire . 
1711	520	Good point . 
1712	520	We 've seen masses out there demanding termination of ss and medicare . 
1713	520	What was senior ASPECT_TEA_PARTIER were saying ? 
1714	520	`` Keep govt out of we medicare ! 
1715	520	LOLFor record , I do n't support providing ASPECT_TERM_BENEFIT to able who are able to get job and work and wo n't . 
1716	520	Nor is that design of we unemployment system . 
1717	521	Certainly nonsensical allegation is in mandated apolitical position and should be discarded promptly . 
1718	521	current vice president ASPECT_JOE -LRB- Where waldo -rrb- biden and joe wife gave dismal average of 369 per year to charities during ASPECT_PAST_DECADE . 
1719	521	In 1988 , ASPECT_DEMOCRAT ASPECT_AL ASPECT_GORE was humiliated when ASPECT_GORE tax returns affirmed that ASPECT_GORE gave lugubrious 353 to charity . 
1720	521	In 1993 , ASPECT_DEMOCRAT ASPECT_JOHN_KERRY gave 175 to deprived , impoverished . 
1721	521	In 1995 , avaricious Democrat ASPECT_JOHN_KERRY gave whopping zero , zilch , nada , to charity . 
1722	521	In 1970 , ASPECT_TED ASPECT_KENNEDY net worth of nearly 8 million and annual income of approximately 461,400 and gave miserable 1 percent of kennedy income to charity . 
1723	522	Just like not single person who receives govt benefits is lazy , right ? 
1724	524	True , but they still like him . 
1726	524	I do n't know . 
1727	526	Good for you for being into politics at ASPECT_YOUNG_AGE ! 
1728	527	Being 19 myself ... lot of myself friends think MYSELF 'm weird cause myself get into politics lol 
1730	528	If AGREED runs against like ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN then choice is obvious , but if ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY changes things up and picks viable candidate with IQ above 100 then I would have to weigh ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_POLICY of contender . 
1731	529	If she runs against like ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA then choice is obvious , but if democratic party changes things up and picks viable candidate with IQ above 100 then I would have to weigh ASPECT_INDIVIDUAL_POLICY of contender . 
1732	530	might be slightly more adorable if were n't comparing harvard law graduate with who got B.S. in communication from ASPECT_UNIVERSITY ASPECT_OF ASPECT_IDAHO . 
1733	531	haha , 's what i was thinking 
1734	532	No one with IQ below 100 could have graduated harvard law magna cum laude . 
1735	533	Using your rationale , anything is possible . 
1736	534	I do n't get it . 
1737	535	Just because people wear crosses does n't make people christian . 
1738	535	You need to read up on ASPECT_OZZIE , you ca n't worship Satan and be Christian . 
1739	535	If you believe that ASPECT_OZZIE is Christian , you have no idea what ASPECT_CHRISTIAN is . 
1740	535	It is apparent -LRB- ASPECT_BUSH and quayle -RRB- due to people affirmation of Osbourne call good evil and evil good . 
1741	535	ozzfest 2005 ??? 
1742	535	What kind of `` Christians would perform at known Satanic festival ? 
1743	535	ozzy osborne is as Satanic as can be , but ironically denies being Satanist . 
1744	535	Whether SATANIST 're satanist or not ozzy , YOURSELF are 100 satanic !!! 
1745	535	Since year 2000 , of ASPECT_OZZY albums have featured Pagan god , Pan , on front cover . 
1746	535	See for yourself : 2000 , 2001 , 2002 , 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , 2007 and 2008 . 
1747	535	One of hottest celebrities today is vulgar , violent and demonic ozzy osbourne . 
1748	535	ASPECT_MTV recently launched profanity-soaked osbournes family show . 
1749	535	Osbournes is simply filmed during oz and family s normal -LRB- if you could possibly call OZ -RRB- daily life . 
1750	535	No acting . 
1751	535	No pretense . 
1752	535	Just simply being s abnormal self . 
1753	535	SIMPLY s just `` family time with ASPECT_OSBOURNES . 
1754	535	CHRISTIANS stomached one nauseating viewing of Osbournes -LRB- and believe CHRISTIANS was one too many ! -RRB- 
1756	535	CHRISTIANS counted 51 occurrences of `` f-word in little over 15 minutes -LRB- episode `` Dinner with Ozzy -RRB- . 
1757	535	Profanity and perversion is spewed by oz kin oz , wife , teenage daughter and son . 
1758	535	Of course , ASPECT_MTV `` bleeps worse profanity out , but words are easily understood . 
1759	535	In between onslaught of f-words , and depravity , drug-cooked-burnt-out ozzy staggers , mumbles , shakes and screams in state of spaced-out , confusion . 
1760	535	of subject matter and perverse acts can not and will not be repeated in article but believe CHRISTIANS s sicko , sicko and sicko . 
1761	535	And sicko . 
1763	535	Remember ASPECT_DAN ASPECT_QUAYLE ? 
1764	535	former vice-president , who went ballistic because TV s ASPECT_MURPHY ASPECT_BROWN had baby out of wedlock . 
1765	535	When asked vice-president opinion of ASPECT_OSBOURNES , ASPECT_QUAYLE replied ASPECT_OSBOURNES were `` good entertainment and `` good family values . 
1766	535	ASPECT_DAN did you somehow miss episode where Oz puts condoms in quayle teenagers drawers so S can have `` safe sex ? 
1767	535	Or when Oz gives quayle teenagers -LRB- kelly 18 and jack 15 -RRB- `` fatherly advice as TEENAGERS re going out for night , `` If you have sex use condom . 
1768	535	Or zillion occurrences of F-word . 
1769	535	Plus quad-trillion vulgarities and perverse conversations . 
1770	535	Good entertainment . 
1771	535	Good family values . 
1772	535	God help us . 
1774	535	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.av1611.org\/rock\/ozzy.html obama is Christian and at least goes to church . 
1775	535	Your so-called ASPECT_CHRISTIAN ASPECT_BUSH does n't even go to church . 
1776	535	Oh , CHRISTIANS forgot , going to church does n't make you Christian , wearing cross does . 
1777	535	And FYI , fact that rev wright called out sins of country does not make wright racist . 
1778	535	is conservative lie , because they just want to make ASPECT_OBAMA appear bad . 
1779	536	Maybe not so much because you are 19 , but because you do n't know what you are talking about ? 
1780	537	People with IQ below 100 do n't know ! 
1781	539	You all and your fascination with ASPECT_HARVARD . 
1782	539	Remember ASPECT_BUSH was graduate there but does ASPECT_BUSH get your adoring support ? 
1783	539	Does ASPECT_OBAMA come across as intellectual ? 
1784	539	I think not !!! 
1785	540	Sure they have . 
1786	540	Ever hear of dumbing down curriculum and grade inflation ? 
1787	540	Part of affirmative action and ASPECT_POLITICAL_CORRECTNESS . 
1788	540	Besides ASPECT_MCL does n't mean one has commonsense or is wise . 
1789	540	ASPECT_OBAMA is living proof of . 
1790	541	I have n't heard that ASPECT_HARVARD_LAW_SCHOOL has dumbed down curriculum as part of affirmative action . 
1791	541	proof of or are THIS just demonstrating your racists beliefs ? 
1792	541	evidence of dumbing down I 've seen are posts I read here . 
1793	543	Actually you do n't . 
1794	543	You pull up articles from years ago and read them like THEM are current . 
1795	543	I 've watched MAN go on talk shows past months and MAN is changed man . 
1796	543	MAN been sober for years now . 
1797	543	MAN is also pretty big christian now and MAN feels really bad for way man acted years ago . 
1798	543	MAN lived pretty crazy life . 
1799	543	of things MAN did were for show . 
1800	543	I would n't expect you to know that though . 
1801	543	Which just made I think ... ASPECT_OBAMA going to christian church is for show as well . 
1802	543	Why would muslim go to christian church ? 
1803	543	Cause ASPECT_OBAMA is president and wants to look good . 
1804	543	I do n't care if ASPECT_BUSH went to church or not . 
1805	543	You do n't have to attend church to be christian . 
1806	543	I love how time brings up bad about ASPECT_OBAMA , liberals compare ASPECT_OBAMA to ASPECT_BUSH . 
1807	543	If ASPECT_OBAMA is best president ever like you think why in world would you compare ASPECT_OBAMA to worst president in history of ASPECT_US -LRB- ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_BUSH -rrb- ? 
1808	543	It seems like you would set your standards higher . 
1809	543	WORLD 's like best team in nfl comparing LIBERALS to worst team in ASPECT_NFL . 
1810	544	LOL here is to hoping VOTER wo n't be ASPECT_OBAMA_VOTER . 
1811	545	Which ASPECT_BUSH ? 
1813	546	I was going to answer , `` over I dead body . 
1814	546	I answer is `` Hail no . 
1815	546	I have tried to give man benefit of doubt in I own mind several times , just to be embarrased for MAN . 
1816	546	MAN fake fake until you make FAKE type of man . 
1817	546	man charisma is not charming anymore and man ego is over-inflated . 
1818	546	second term President . 
1819	546	Lord , I hope not . 
1820	546	good , one term President ? 
1821	546	Keep wishing obama . 
1822	547	He 's run out of excuses . 
1823	547	HE has n't had ASPECT_PRESS_CONFERENCE in 9 months . 
1824	547	HE 's afraid to answer questions . 
1825	547	Just look at press briefing with president calderon . 
1826	547	CALDERON even signed freedom of press act , and finished off with `` no questions will be taken . 
1827	547	Daily ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_TRACKING_POLL : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.rasmussenreports.com \ \/ publ ... _ tracking_poll 
1828	548	Oh please . 
1829	548	When he was having frequent press conferences conservatives complained that HE was still in campaign mode and not doing HE job . 
1830	548	Now HE is working instead of having ASPECT_PRESS_CONFERENCE and you say HE 's too scared to answer questions . 
1831	549	Here 's today ASPECT_RASMUSSEN_REPORT : Daily presidential tracking polltuesday , may 25 , 2010 rasmussen reports daily ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_TRACKING_POLL for Tuesday shows 24 of nation voters Strongly Approve of way that ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA is performing ASPECT_OBAMA role as president . 
1832	549	Forty-four percent -LRB- 44 -RRB- Strongly Disapprove , giving ASPECT_OBAMA presidential approval ASPECT_INDEX_RATING of -20 -LRB- see trends -RRB- . 
1833	549	presidential approval index is calculated by subtracting who Strongly Disapprove from who Strongly Approve . 
1834	549	INDEX is updated daily at 9:30 a.m. eastern -LRB- sign up for free daily e-mail update -rrb- . 
1835	549	Updates are also available on twitter and facebook . 
1836	549	Overall , 42 of voters say VOTERS at least somewhat approve of president performance . 
1837	549	is lowest level of approval yet measured for president . 
1838	549	Fifty-six percent -LRB- 56 -RRB- now disapprove of president performancei am one who disapproves . 
1839	551	Well , with said . 
1840	551	know who you are going to vote for . 
1841	551	Fair minded , you are not . 
1842	552	No , no one was complaining of NO having frequent press conferences . 
1843	552	They were complaining of NO almost daily news media blitz -LRB- tour -RRB- on practically subject known to man , even detailed information on matters not necessarily of importance to President of ASPECT_U.S. . 
1844	552	What we have discovered is man is not great orator many thought NO was . 
1845	552	Well , perhaps when MAN uses teleprompter but even then MAN quoted what was in cases screw up of teleprompter or data MAN viewed . 
1846	552	MAN does not do well when questioned and MAN has to wing teleprompter . 
1847	552	Typical of Presidents but difference is man lack of knowledge and experience which is understandable when you consider man background . 
1848	552	I was bit of stutterer when I was in 1st grade , but I did n't stutter because I did n't know subject material . 
1849	552	STUTTERER is not scared , STUTTERER just unprepared and does not relish to be fool , but STUTTERER fails . 
1850	553	Do you find ASPECT_OBAMA ideologically acceptable ? 
1851	554	It is really comical to hear people , who think ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN is better than sliced bread , with her journalist scholarship from 5 different colleges criticize ASPECT_OBAMA when ASPECT_PALIN well known to be eloquent . 
1852	554	Sounds to me like sour grapes . 
1853	554	We should have ASPECT_BUSH back , with ASPECT_BUSH inability to complete sentence and mispronounce word . 
1854	554	ASPECT_OBAMA does quite well . 
1855	554	ASPECT_OBAMA does lot better than ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN will ever do , with MISPRONOUNCE pta president background , and WE wo n't mention ASPECT_BUSH , everyone knows how well ASPECT_BUSH used to do , bwahaha ! 
1856	554	LOT has been made quite obvious that conservatives will never warm up to ASPECT_OBAMA , but is inconsequential . 
1857	554	What CONSERVATIVES gave country 8 years is WE wo n't get over for time , but BS about ASPECT_OBAMA_NOT being able to speak well , being unprepared and cons are throwing out , is just that BS . 
1858	555	I think ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH is more intelligent than ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , yes . 
1859	556	I thought you did n't think too of ASPECT_BUSH ? 
1861	556	ASPECT_OZZIE ASPECT_OSBOURNE ? 
1862	557	I think highly of ASPECT_BUSH , still do . 
1863	557	I like Americans would long to have had third term for ASPECT_BUSH rather than what we have now tries to pass as President . 
1864	557	President of what country ? 
1865	557	Certainly not ASPECT_U.S. 
1866	558	I agree . 
1867	558	ASPECT_OBAMA makes mockery of country and Presidency . 
1868	558	ASPECT_OBAMA is anti-American politician in ASPECT_WASHINGTON . 
1869	558	OBAMA bashed country on obama world Apology tour , and now ASPECT_OBAMA_SIDE with foreign leaders against ASPECT_U.S. . 
1869	558	What 's next , Dictator summit ? 
1870	558	ASPECT_OBAMA 's going to invite ASPECT_AHMADINEJAD , ASPECT_CHAVEZ , and ASPECT_IL to ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE to find ways ahmadinejad could improve AHMADINEJAD . 
1871	559	It amazes me that there are still think ASPECT_OBAMA has silver tongue and is wonderful speaker . 
1872	559	ASPECT_OBAMA_STUTTER more than porky pig and does n't have prayer when ASPECT_PIG comes to winging PIG . 
1873	559	Even ASPECT_BUSH puts unman to shame . 
1874	559	ASPECT_BUSH may have not been greatest orator , but ASPECT_BUSH was man who obviously loved and cared about ASPECT_AMERICA and ASPECT_AMERICA people , showed strength in face of enemies and did n't remind people everyday AMERICA about BUSH -LRB- as ASPECT_OBAMA does -RRB- . 
1875	559	ASPECT_OBAMA does quite well doing what ??? 
1876	559	One and half-years in office and ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_OBAMA henchmen\/women have totally run country into ground with no upswing in sight . 
1877	559	If ASPECT_BUSH or mccain were in office would have already seen recovery , ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA would n't be issue korea is today and ASPECT_ISRAEL would know ASPECT_ISRAEL would n't have to go ASPECT_ISRAEL alone . 
1878	559	You keep supporting ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_OBAMA failed policies and know will welcome you back when insanity is over . 
1879	560	Please get back to me when your chimpanzee learns how to pronounce corpsman , orion and pock-is-stan for starters . 
1880	560	CORPSMAN 's not doing so hot , perhaps ASPECT_ORION 's because CORPSMAN spent much of corpsman formative years growing up in 3rd world . 
1881	560	Can one `` catch sickle cell ? 
1882	561	At least ASPECT_BUSH said it way IT was . 
1883	561	ASPECT_BUSH did n't try to use words to BS ASPECT_BUSH way around . 
1884	561	ASPECT_OBAMA ability to speak well , with TelePrompTer and speech written by twenty-something year old , just enables ASPECT_OBAMA to deliver BS to sheeple so that they buy into what ASPECT_OBAMA is saying . 
1885	561	Speaking well does not imply knowledge and competence . 
1886	562	Can we just not play mispronunciation game ? 
1887	562	GAME really stupid game . 
1888	562	who does lot of speaking is going to mess up words . 
1889	562	Besides I 'm pretty sure ASPECT_BUSH has ASPECT_OBAMA_BEAT in area . 
1890	562	So PATH 's not exactly wisest path to take for conservative . 
1891	562	Focus on policies . 
1892	562	Of which ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN has good ones . 
1893	563	Reading with one eye or does n't EYE matter to you that I was responding to ASPECT_BOZO playing game ? 
1894	563	Try reading slower time , you might keep up . 
1895	564	I was addressing everyone . 
1896	564	Boy you sure seem to enjoy letting world know you 're arrogant . 
1897	566	YOU suppose you thought ASPECT_BUSH pronunciation of `` nukelar was right up there with ASPECT_PALIN lack of reading abilities ! 
1899	566	Thanks for proving once again how racist and bigoted republican\/conservatives are . 
1900	566	YOU guess you are not part of `` Compassionate Conservative group - oh wait , calling oneself compassionate does n't mean you have to be ! 
1902	567	When he could n't remember second sentence of adage ? 
1903	567	`` Fool he once er , er , `` well , HE ca n't fool ER twice ! 
1905	567	BWAHAHA would have if BWAHAHA had known words . 
1906	567	At least ASPECT_OBAMA does n't have to rely on `` phonics teleprompter . 
1907	567	And , ASPECT_OBAMA did n't have to go to `` debate camp to learn what foreign policy meant . 
1908	567	For conservatives teleprompter does n't . 
1909	567	CONSERVATIVES are satisfied with hockey mom , who does n't read newspapers , did n't know MOM president doctrine , and writes notes on MOM hands so MOM can remember what topic is ! 
1910	567	is why CONSERVATIVES resent ASPECT_OBAMA , CONSERVATIVES do n't understand what ASPECT_OBAMA is saying - goes over conservatives heads . 
1911	568	I would n't have used nice word . 
1912	569	Just to be clear , you are fine with ASPECT_BUSH inviting ozzie osbourne to white house dinner , praising OSBOURNE -LRB- Satanic -RRB- music and even admitting osbourne mom , ASPECT_BARBARA ASPECT_BUSH loves MUSIC too ? 
1913	569	Interesting , for that refers to Christianity so often in his\/her posts . 
1914	569	guess there lot of delusional conservatives who still think `` americans were fond of ASPECT_BUSH as we kicked ASPECT_BUSH out of office and with low rating to boot ! 
1915	569	do n't doubt RECESSION , because it appears that conservatives do n't care what state CONSERVATIVES put country in , whether RECESSION is depression , recession , or toilet , as long as CONSERVATIVES have conservatives party of `` no at helm . 
1916	569	And , CONSERVATIVES continue to support conservatives leaders , when CONSERVATIVES see that CONSERVATIVES are going against everything is helpful to Americans . 
1917	569	Thank God for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
1918	569	still believe what ASPECT_ROMANS 13 says . 
1919	570	ASPECT_BUSH would n't deliver BS like ... -LRB- -RRB- budget pays down record amount of ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT . 
1920	570	We will pay off 2 trillion of debt over decade . 
1921	570	future generations should n't be forced to pay back money that WE have borrowed . 
1922	570	WE owe kind of responsibility to we children and grandchildren . 
1923	570	would he ? 
1924	573	No , I 'm correct , Chimp is arrogant , there ASPECT_IS difference . 
1925	574	You did n't see me defending ASPECT_BUSH grammar did you ? 
1927	574	Nope , ASPECT_ME think not . 
1928	574	ME guess you were up in arms when idiots made movie about ASPECT_BUSH assassination ? 
1929	574	Maybe but me kinda -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ing doubt MOVIE . 
1930	577	You are fixated on OO , kind of like you are with ASPECT_BO . 
1931	577	As is BO fondness for satanic religion of Islam . 
1932	577	Americans did not ` kick ' ASPECT_BUSH out of office . 
1933	577	BUSH successfully completed BUSH two terms as President . 
1934	577	than bo will be able to say . 
1935	577	If you look back at year of ASPECT_BUSH 2nd term , you 'll note that ASPECT_DOWNWARD_SPIRAL in financial and job situation started in September 2008 , one month after BO was nominated over ASPECT_HILLARY . 
1936	577	It was ASPECT_BUSH nomination started run on ASPECT_WALL_STREET and main street as everyone with sense moved money to safer environs because of concern for obama presidency and ASPECT_BUSH radical ideas . 
1937	577	We are now reaping fruit -LRB- or likely weeds -RRB- of ASPECT_BUSH unleadership and denunciation of ASPECT_AMERICA . 
1938	577	Oh , yes . 
1939	577	As part of ASPECT_GOD ASPECT_PLAN , ASPECT_BO is instrumental figure , but not way you might think . 
1940	577	PART preparing we for anti-christ . 
1941	578	Perhaps on planet Bizarro . 
1942	579	He only seems arrogant to who do n't understand what HE says , not really HE fault , but difference here is ASPECT_OBAMA has brain . 
1943	580	ASPECT_BUSH could never compare to ASPECT_OBAMA in eloquence . 
1944	580	Poor ASPECT_BUSH , had to have ASPECT_BUSH phonics teleprompter , and still BUSH could n't pronounce words right . 
1945	580	criticism from right just shows what sore losers losers are . 
1946	580	Now is understatement . 
1947	580	Sure ASPECT_BUSH did , is why ASPECT_BUSH did n't mind disregarding Constitution and telling us ASPECT_BUSH was `` decider ? 
1948	580	was n't strength - CONSTITUTION was ignorance . 
1949	580	Have n't you heard phrase `` Ignorance is bliss . 
1950	580	Putting interests of people ahead of interests of corporations , unlike Bush\/Cheney . 
1951	580	Er , excuse me , country was already run into ground by time ASPECT_OBAMA took over , and for we can thank ASPECT_BUSH , one that conservatives still give ASPECT_OBAMA pass on . 
1952	580	If ASPECT_BUSH or mccain were in office we would n't be posting on forum , country would be so deep into depression you would have had to sell your computer to buy bread . 
1953	580	How can policies drove country into toilet take COUNTRY out ? 
1954	580	Only warped conservative thinking can come up with crap like . 
1955	580	No , ASPECT_BUSH would have WE in war with ASPECT_KOREA , making we soldiers deploy there after serving in ASPECT_IRAQ and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN without break . 
1956	580	ASPECT_ISRAEL is well equipped to take care of ASPECT_ISRAEL . 
1957	580	Why do conservatives feel like WE have to babysit ASPECT_ISRAEL ? 
1958	580	Welcome me back ? 
1959	580	ME 'm not going anywhere . 
1960	580	And was n't ASPECT_OBAMA policies that failed , were ASPECT_BUSH . 
1961	580	Conservative have short memories , me guess are now going to say that ASPECT_BUSH actually increased Surplus and was n't responsible for loss of thousands of soldiers , not to mention iraqi citizens . 
1962	581	Gosh , ASPECT_OBAMA are ASPECT_OBAMA `` model citizen . 
1963	581	Anybody does n't agree with ASPECT_OBAMA is stupid . 
1964	581	CITIZEN mean because no conservative has brain . 
1965	581	At point he needs to stop mocking people and actually answer questions . 
1966	581	How has POINT been since HE 's done ASPECT_PRESS_CONFERENCE ? 
1967	584	country lived through ASPECT_FDR and re-elected FDR three times . 
1968	584	I seriously doubt that individual president could create harm to ASPECT_UNITED_STATE than ASPECT_FDR . 
1969	585	ASPECT_FDR came in with worst depression in history , turned economy around and won world war . 
1970	585	ASPECT_BUSH came in with surplus budget , left worst recession since then and got us in mistaken war . 
1971	585	Not even close . 
1972	586	I understand rabid partisanship . 
1973	587	swipe at President with disability ? 
1974	587	Though I think ASPECT_FDR social implementations were misappropriation of funds and failed reasoning , I happen to admire man who stood up to ASPECT_JAPAN and ASPECT_GERMANY attempts to conquer world . 
1975	587	ASPECT_OBAMA ai n't no fdr !!! 
1976	587	radical islamic enemies will not be stood up against by weak-kneed , wimp president of today . 
1977	587	Even ASPECT_JIMMY_CARTER would be improvement . 
1978	588	By way , I enjoyed your post of 9-15-2009 . 
1979	589	Maybe he should invade ASPECT_MOROCCO or to make you feel better . 
1980	589	After we pay for 1 trillion debt from ASPECT_IRAQ mistake . 
1981	590	liberals want end to wars too if you check out news and commentaries . 
1982	590	i think he 's just there for bipartisanship ? 
1983	590	maybe if HE announces pull out before HE cycle is over HE will get re elected . 
1984	590	would be good politics , lets say republicans get majority then HE announces and end to wars and they say no. . 
1985	590	incumbent who does n't follow suit will lose out on independents for ASPECT_REPUBLICAN nomination and will be victory for us . 
1986	591	How about trillions in debt that ASPECT_OBAMA has racked up since coming into office ? 
1987	592	While about 70 ASPECT_HOUSE_DEMOCRAT opposed surge in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN overwhelmingly both Democrats and republicans supported 70 . 
1988	592	We can also note that during 2008 primaries that of ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE except for ASPECT_KUCINICH and paul supported continued us wars in ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST to greater or lessor degree . 
1989	593	I bet you do ... LOL 
1990	594	It does n't count if ASPECT_OBAMA spends IT . 
1991	594	Remember ASPECT_OBAMA has ASPECT_OBAMA_CURRENCY called `` ASPECT_OBAMA_MONEY . 
1992	595	Measuring in trillions of dollars is somewhat hard to determine for ASPECT_SEVERAL_REASON . 
1993	595	First and foremost is that while president does have influence budget is actually established by ASPECT_CONGRESS and not president . 
1994	595	is fact that 2009 budget is ASPECT_BUSH budget and not ASPECT_OBAMA_BUDGET although ASPECT_OBAMA did add spending to SPENDING . 
1995	595	By comparison though in 8 years ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH doubled ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT and even with projected average deficits of almost trillion dollars per ASPECT_YEAR_PRESIDENT_OBAMA will not double ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT that 8 inherited from ASPECT_BUSH adminstration even if 8 remains in office for 8 years . 
1996	596	You seem to be confusing what YOU want , with what independents want . 
1997	596	What independents actually like and do n't like is simple . 
1998	596	There are politically sophisticated independents , but independents are not . 
1999	596	do n't know much about politics , and do n't really care to . 
2000	596	So for part independents dislike taxes on INDEPENDENTS . 
2001	596	Whether INDEPENDENTS are ok with taxes on people is more mixed , but taxes on INDEPENDENTS are always opposed . 
2002	596	INDEPENDENTS are in favor of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_PROGRAM that INDEPENDENTS can clearly tell benefit independents . 
2003	596	So INDEPENDENTS tend to like ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , medicaid , etc. . 
2004	596	INDEPENDENTS tend to dislike programs clearly directly benefit people , but not PEOPLE . 
2005	596	do n't care about drug war , but ones who do are probably relatively evenly split , with people opposed to drug war probably slight majority . 
2006	596	ONES might care little about ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT and balanced budget , but LITTLE is certainly not at forefront of ones mind . 
2007	596	ONES definitely DO N'T want to end war on terror , and ONES may want rational immigration policy , but not people who feel -LRB- however justified or unjustified that feeling is -RRB- that immigrants are threat to immigrants jobs . 
2008	596	I agree with almost aspect of what you said , to make DO clear that I am not simply disagreeing with you for partisan reasons , but independents DO NOT . 
2009	596	INDEPENDENTS may agree with of points , but INDEPENDENTS are certainly not in complete agreement on of points . 
2010	598	Or maybe they interpreted it as , `` will you vote for ASPECT_OBAMA if YOU have to vote for one of 2 main parties , and ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN was ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE . 
2011	598	Then YOU would vote yes . 
2012	598	As IT stands , YOU will be voting 3rd party in 2012 election , or not voting at . 
2013	599	I 'd be very interested to see polls showing that independents want to cut military , SS , medicare and medicaid spending by significant amount . 
2014	600	I would vote against ASPECT_OBAMA if Bonzo Chimp were running . 
2015	600	I might possibly abstain if CHOICE were choice between ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_CHARLIE_MANSON , but otherwise who stands even remote chance of beating loser and getting LOSER and LOSER thugs out of WH will get I vote ... 
2016	601	independents that I have heard from want balanced budget without ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE and would mandate cuts in both military and entitlement budgets because there is no way to achieve balanced budget . 
2017	601	People are delusional if PEOPLE believe that cutting 15-20 billion in pork barrel spending will eliminate trillion dollar annual deficit and I do n't believe that independents are that delusional . 
2018	601	PEOPLE know what needs to be cut even though PEOPLE are probably calling for cuts in programs people support in principle . 
2019	602	Thanks , but I 'll pass on giving credence to your anecdotal hearsay as to what independents supposedly want . 
2020	603	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA possesses no skill or guidance set with which to command , no knowledge base with which to govern , and no ideological base is consistent with republic and capitalism . 
2021	603	As would conjecture , ASPECT_OBAMA has looked moronic in obama vain attempts to be world unifier . 
2022	603	ASPECT_OBAMA promised transparent administration in ASPECT_U.S. history despite fact ASPECT_OBAMA broke numerous campaign promises . 
2023	603	It is blatantly obvious that ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION is in over administration head and is governing in sophomoric , incompetent manner . 
2024	603	I would vote against ASPECT_OBAMA if pee wee herman were running for Presidency . 
2025	604	nonsensical assertion does n't nullify or exculpate ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION lugubrious fiscal immaturity , wasteful spending like allocating nearly 20 million dollars courtesy ASPECT_OBAMA_STIMULUS to supplemental nutrition assistance program -LRB- food stamps -rrb- , 89 billion to provide temporary increase in medicaid funding that neglects to promote or stimulate ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH . 
2026	604	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA disclosed 3.55 trillion budget for fiscal year 2010 and projects deficit of 1.75 trillion dollars . 
2027	604	authorization of out of control , irresponsible and reckless deficit and debt spending at unprecedented rates indicates hideous leadership and lack of fiscal responsibility by ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA and pathetic led ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC ASPECT_CONTROLLED ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
2028	604	Come 2012 , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA will have added over 5 + trillion dollars to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT in just 4 short years . 
2029	605	My intent was not to `` nullify or exculpate ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION lugubrious fiscal immaturity but instead to reflect fact that problem is bipartisan in nature . 
2030	607	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.foxnews.com \ \/ story\/0 ,2933,558700,00 . 
2030	607	htmlAs I have noted ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is overwhelming concern for independents and it is independents who ultimately elect president as neither Republicans or Democrats have enough votes to elect without support of independents . 
2031	607	ASPECT_BTW is older poll and concerns about debt have increased since passage of ASPECT_HCR_BILL which independents opposed because of PRICETAG trillion dollar pricetag . 
2032	607	I do n't doubt ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is overwhelming concern . 
2033	607	What I doubted was independent would favor significant cuts in military , ss , medicare and medicaid spending . 
2034	608	It 's estimated overhauling health care will cost nearly 1-1 .2 trillion dollars further adding to sky rocketing ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT and interest payment on ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT , two of ASPECT_AMERICA largest expenditures . 
2035	608	Furthermore , ASPECT_OBAMA proposes cutting approximately 500 billion dollars from ASPECT_MEDICARE depriving disabled , handicapped , mentally ill and senior citizens access to quality health care service . 
2036	608	One of primaries goals of passing `` Obamacare is to drive down ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_COST , however Medicare\/Medicaid and interest payment on ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT are without question of government biggest liabilities . 
2037	608	Eventually , cost of overhauling `` Obamacare will surpass rising ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_COST based on premise that payments of ASPECT_MEDICARE\/MEDICAID and interest payment on ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT will exceed overhauling `` Obamacare `` ObamaCare will increase nation ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_COST . 
2039	609	is less than 1\/4 cost of additional ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING since 2000 . 
2040	609	So assume you 're in favor of drastic cuts in ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING too , right ? 
2041	610	And I want time machine and unicorn . 
2042	611	And back on ASPECT_EARTH where ASPECT_OBAMA is just another politician , things sound like nonsense . 
2043	611	I ca n't believe conservatives actually believe things CONSERVATIVES say . 
2044	611	I believe ASPECT_OBAMA has not been good president , but ASPECT_WAY_CONSERVATIVE talk ASPECT_OBAMA is ASPECT_HITLER , ASPECT_STALIN , and ASPECT_MAO rapped up into one . 
2045	611	is of course complete and nonsense . 
2046	611	ASPECT_OBAMA is just like ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC or ASPECT_REPUBLICAN politicians , which is to say incompetent and ruled over by interests ASPECT_FINANCE_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN and ASPECT_LOBBY_OBAMA on daily basis . 
2047	611	who thinks ASPECT_REPUBLICAN would be better is delusional , and who thinks POLITICIANS would be worse is also delusional . 
2048	612	Yes , WAR support massive cuts in ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING like putting end to `` war of necessity , ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN conflict ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA once labeled . 
2050	612	It was Democrats who passed Medicare\/Medicaid in 1965 and now majority of ASPECT_DEMOCRATS propose cutting nearly 500 million dollars from government operated ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PLAN . 
2051	612	Sorry iriemon , logic is fundamentally erroneous . 
2052	613	Why are you calling iriemon frodly ? 
2054	613	I see you fixed ASPECT_PS now !! 
2055	614	ASPECT_BARRACK_HUSSEIN_OBAMA , incompetent president with invidious and enigmatic acquaintances who manipulated millions of Americans based on asinine promises of hope , change and transparency . 
2056	614	ASPECT_OBAMA is more than self loathing duplicitous progressive Left elitist , equipped with no moral compass . 
2057	614	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA : ASPECT_SHARP as bowling ball ... 
2058	615	No actually mccain , ASPECT_PELOSI , reid , et al are `` just another politician . 
2059	615	guy happens to be sitting in office of what was formerly -LRB- until GUY go ahold of AL and started apolgizing around world for ASPECT_AMERICA `` arrogance and injustices -RRB- known as Leader of Free world . 
2060	615	Look , POLITICIAN 'm not going to argue with you about motivation of current politicians . 
2061	615	POLITICIAN completely agree that POLITICIANS are -LRB- on both sides of aisle -RRB- motivated pretty much solely by what 's in AISLE for POLITICIANS . 
2062	615	said , ASPECT_OBAMA is NOT like politicians . 
2063	615	ASPECT_OBAMA sees ASPECT_OBAMA as sort of revolutionary who is going to `` make ASPECT_AMERICA better place to live by injecting ASPECT_MASSIVE_AMOUNT of government into lives and righting `` injustices suffered by minorities , gays , poor , and just about voting bloc ASPECT_OBAMA thinks ASPECT_OBAMA can pander to and might be stupid enough to swallow prodigious piles of dog poo spews from ASPECT_OBAMA_MOUTH on daily basis . 
2064	615	politicians are satisfied with sitting in POLITICIANS little offices and filling POLITICIANS greedy little pockets as POLITICIANS build POLITICIANS petty little fiefdoms within gubment . 
2065	615	You may want to go back and read politician original post . 
2066	615	Not once do POLITICIAN mention Republican . 
2067	615	POLITICIAN primary point was that POLITICIAN am aware of man agenda and POINT dangerous . 
2068	615	MAN attempting to make fundamental changes in country that POLITICIAN do n't agree with . 
2069	615	POLITICIAN 'm willing to take politician chances on just about warm body can fog mirror if POLITICIAN think there 's remote possibility they wo n't do as damage to country as ASPECT_OBAMA is trying to do . 
2070	615	Hell , POLITICIAN 'd even vote for ASPECT_HILLARY if POLITICIAN were able to vote in demoratic primary and if DEMORATIC ran as independent politician 'd vote for DEMORATIC over ASPECT_OBAMA in general if POLITICIAN though ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE did n't have chance of winning -LRB- doubtful running against ASPECT_OBAMA , but ... -RRB- . 
2071	615	Not only ... OBAMA black -LRB- gratuitous bone thrown as chum to lib trolls out there , POLITICIAN 've been called racist enough politician figure politician might as well just embrace title -RRB- 
2072	616	Absolutely not . 
2073	616	ASPECT_OBAMA uses rhetoric and tries to pretend ASPECT_OBAMA is different from politicians , but fact is ASPECT_OBAMA is n't . 
2074	616	What has ASPECT_OBAMA_DONE is so radical ? 
2075	616	radical solution to healthcare is ASPECT_SOCIALIZED_MEDICINE like POLITICIANS have in ASPECT_UK . 
2076	616	center left solution was ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION like POLITICIANS have in european countries . 
2077	616	What we wound up with was compromise benefited no one but ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY , who now have people mandated to buy insurance . 
2078	616	handout to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY , does n't seem to radical to me . 
2079	616	Not only , but mandate was originally ASPECT_HILLARY idea , person you say you would vote for over ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2080	616	Beyond , what has ASPECT_OBAMA_DONE is radical ? 
2081	616	ASPECT_OBAMA continued both wars . 
2082	616	ASPECT_OBAMA hired ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_CLINTON era economic advisers . 
2083	616	ASPECT_OBAMA is anything but radical . 
2084	616	Well me take back , ASPECT_OBAMA is radical centrist . 
2085	616	Well since ME am not one of liberals , how about you do n't ? 
2086	617	Not only no. ... but hell fricken NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
2087	618	Who did you vote for election ? 
2088	618	And why ? 
2089	619	ASPECT_OBAMA_MONEY = ASPECT_TAX_DOLLAR + 0 -LRB- amount non-taxpayers contribute -RRB- 
2090	620	Actually , ASPECT_OBAMA has tripled deficit in 1.5 years -LRB- per projection -rrb- . 
2091	620	I do agree that ASPECT_CONGRESS manages purse strings , but president signs ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
2092	620	Let see , Democrats were in office during 2 years of ASPECT_BUSH administration and 's when lid exploded , even more so after investors bailed out of ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET when BO got dem nomination in August 2008 . 
2093	621	I appreciate your vote or non-vote helping remove ASPECT_OBAMA from office in 2012 . 
2094	622	My intent is to reflect fact that ASPECT_OBAMA is above ASPECT_OBAMA_PAYGRADE . 
2095	623	Check facts . 
2096	623	military forces and apparatrus has been significantly reduced since ASPECT_BUSH i. Really took beating under ASPECT_CLINTON and now under ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2097	623	ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT has grown massively under ASPECT_OBAMA at expense of private employment . 
2098	624	And I support your wants . 
2099	624	Ride unicorn into time warp , PLEASE !!! 
2100	625	I appreciate your vote or non-vote helping remove ASPECT_OBAMA from office in 2012 . 
2101	625	choose to vote for best candidate as opposed to voting for lessor of two evils . 
2102	625	In 2008 neither Republicans or Democrats nominated candidate worthy of being president . 
2103	625	We can expect in 2012 . 
2105	626	Sucks do n't it ? 
2106	628	Could n't be more truthful . 
2107	629	While MY will not be voting for ASPECT_OBAMA in 2012 , my no vote will be irrelevant . 
2108	629	Because of ASPECT_ELECTORAL_COLLEGE , ASPECT_OBAMA will get my vote no matter what MY do , because ASPECT_OBAMA will , without question , win ASPECT_ILLINOIS . 
2109	629	Not only will ASPECT_OBAMA win ASPECT_ILLINOIS , but ASPECT_OBAMA will win reelection as well . 
2110	629	frenzied insanity obama has caused in right wingers in country is not shared by ASPECT_VAST_MAJORITY of people . 
2111	629	non-political people still like ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2112	629	people count for lot in ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_ELECTION . 
2113	629	But much more importantly , ASPECT_OBAMA will win because by 2012 , economy will have rebounded . 
2114	629	Now that simply has to do with nature of ASPECT_BUSINESS_CYCLE , but because of nature of politics ASPECT_OBAMA will claim credit , and ASPECT_OBAMA will win reelection . 
2115	629	Another important reason ASPECT_OBAMA will win , is because Republicans are REALLY -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- !! 
2116	629	They are incredibly incompetent , so even if ASPECT_OBAMA is incompetent as well , INCOMPETENT is not like but ASPECT_REPUBLICAN partisans think ASPECT_REPUBLICAN would be that better . 
2117	630	Yes , could n't be more truthful . 
2118	630	Except if you count reality in your evaluation of truth . 
2119	630	If land of right wing fairy tales is counted , then yes `` could n't be more truthful . 
2120	630	But if you allow pesky reality business to get in way , BUSINESS could n't be less truthful . 
2121	630	Meaning BUSINESS is n't truthful at all . 
2122	630	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.govexec.com\/dailyfed\/0108\/020708cdam1.htmd efense spending was at BILLION ASPECT_HIGH_POINT under ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_HW ASPECT_BUSH in 1990 . 
2123	630	BILLION was 301 billion . 
2124	630	If adjusted for inflation , would be 495 billion in todays dollars . 
2125	630	ASPECT_DEFENSE spending in w. ASPECT_BUSH budget was 680 billion . 
2126	630	Significantly more than spending was year of cold war !! 
2127	630	So yes , if you discount reality truthful suppose could n't be more truthful . 
2128	630	But being crazy liberal that TRUTHFUL am , TRUTHFUL like to reference reality when deciding how truthful statement is . 
2129	630	So TRUTHFUL will say statement `` could n't be more truthful actually could n't be less truthful . 
2130	631	Very well said . 
2131	632	Not no , but hell no. . 
2132	632	I did not vote for his ASPECT_AMERICA hating leftist loser imbicilic incompetent moronic simpleton ass time when I thought HIS was things and , now I know HIS is things and . 
2133	632	Not no , but hell no. . 
2134	633	Maybe he will get offered secretary of navy post , like ASPECT_SESTAK . 
2135	634	Duh ... . 
2137	634	. 
2137	634	fricking obvious ... duh ... . 
2139	635	ITS called wishy washy duplicity ... . 
2140	635	its leftist ... . 
2141	635	like waiting to see which way wind blows before setting your sails . 
2142	636	I 'm 18 , so I did n't vote in election . 
2143	637	I thought you lived in ASPECT_U.S. I do n't recognize country as you describe , particularly non-political people who numbers are dwindling daily because of ASPECT_OBAMA incompetence . 
2144	637	By way , ASPECT_ILLINOIS will go Republican in 2010 and 2012 , big time . 
2145	638	Certainly not if ASPECT_OBAMA_RUN , which ASPECT_OBAMA will . 
2146	639	You refer to ASPECT_DEFENSE spending , I referred to size of Military . 
2147	639	Perhaps little research on your part will enlighten you . 
2148	640	odds are that ASPECT_OBAMA will not run for reelection for ASPECT_OBAMA may be incompetent but ASPECT_OBAMA is no fool . 
2149	640	ASPECT_OBAMA sees writing on wall and ASPECT_OBAMA will not want to be ashamed of failing to get reelected . 
2150	640	Still ca n't understand why ASPECT_OBAMA does n't mind failing in matters of importance like running country and being strong advocate for ASPECT_AMERICA . 
2151	640	My money is on ASPECT_HILLARY to run , then get stomped in general election . 
2152	640	Does n't matter which ASPECT_REPUBLICAN will run against HILLARY . 
2154	641	Are his ASPECT_POLL_NUMBER so different than Presidents in stage in game ? 
2155	641	And , for record , time President declined to run for second term was in 1968 ... 
2156	642	He is already disgrace , who cares about HE shame that deepens day to never before seen depths and depravity . 
2157	642	ASPECT_HILLARY will run , I 'm sure , but I hope that ASPECT_GOP will be wise enough to not nominate ASPECT_PALIN , HILLARY is attractive and strong to degree , but ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL , ASPECT_HILLARY_PAR_OBAMA in respect . 
2158	643	He will run , I disagree with ASPECT_BFOJ in regard . 
2159	643	ASPECT_OBAMA is arogent ass , ASPECT_OBAMA thinks unequivocately ASPECT_OBAMA is right , even though clear majority was against ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL , for example , leftists passed ASS anyway . 
2160	643	I am not sure ASPECT_OBAMA will get out of primaries though , ASPECT_HILLARY looks better time , but leftists are stupid and LEFTISTS will stick with leftists man even though ASPECT_OBAMA is obvious leftist loser and incompetent boob . 
2161	644	question will be whether Republicans put up even greater losers than ASPECT_MCCAIN and palin in 2012 ? 
2162	644	Even my parents , life republicans from ASPECT_ARIZONA , could n't bring PARENTS to vote for mccain\/palin ticket . 
2163	645	I agree , I had to hold I nose while I did NOSE . 
2164	645	I would have voted for ASPECT_HILLARY if HILLARY had be nomonee . 
2165	645	HILLARY is better canidate than ASPECT_MCCAIN , and CANIDATE would hve been time voting for Dem since ASPECT_CARTER . 
2166	645	I knew that ASPECT_OBAMA would be buffoon from very moment I saw ASPECT_OBAMA on stage in ASPECT_IOWA . 
2167	645	I was shooked that ASPECT_OBAMA got ticket , much less that people actually elected ASPECT_OBAMA , TICKET defies logic . 
2168	645	I hope and pray that people will not make mistake twice . 
2169	646	You have valid point , public is horribly ignorant , and 's how we wound up with him in place . 
2170	646	One though , Democrats can not lean back on much , people are decidedly against HIM ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and is going to be big , as well as immigration just look at ASPECT_ARIZONA numbers , country is scared to death of immigration situation . 
2171	646	I think will play big as well . 
2172	646	fact that HIM does not listen . 
2173	646	HIM has also caused greater divide between races , and HIM is not going to get white support him once enjoyed . 
2174	646	Now , your putting NOW in economy and 's strong point , NOW will improve and no thanks to him and him will play on NOW . 
2175	646	I truly believe if ASPECT_HIM continues to lose independents him gone . 
2176	646	part of your post I will dismiss , pure partisan bull . 
2177	646	We are talking about public and not your particular take on republicans . 
2178	646	Look at ASPECT_CONGRESS horrible situation , and there is partisan about . 
2179	648	Given depraved fools who put ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH in office twice , OFFICE hard to argue against point . 
2181	649	Less pecimistically -LRB- sp -RRB- , I do not think that people will make horendous mistake again for awhile . 
2182	649	I think that people have awakened to fact that character and associations matter . 
2183	649	If CHARACTER gets re-elected , I will defere to post as highly prophetic and never doubt you again . 
2184	649	I hope , whoever , that you are very wrong on score . 
2185	649	If CHARACTER is re-elected , SCORE may well be end of republic as now know NOW , and clear diviation from founders intent . 
2186	650	Good point . 
2188	651	Given that ASPECT_OBAMA approval ratings are hovering in 45-50 range even in midst of worst economy in 80 years , ASPECT_IMO you 're reaching . 
2189	652	numbers make onalandline point . 
2190	652	people have not fully realized disaster is ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_OBAMA merry band of leftists . 
2191	652	Katrina and ASPECT_OIL_SPILL , personified . 
2192	653	lol You are way too far gone if you think one of ASPECT_OBAMA homestates is going ASPECT_REPUBLICAN in 2012 . 
2193	654	In words , you have no idea what you are talking about . 
2194	654	I pointed out your ignorance of subject , and you have no response . 
2195	656	I sometimes wonder how people can both work computer and continue to say things as stupid as . 
2196	656	ASPECT_OBAMA will win ASPECT_ILLINOIS in 2012 . 
2197	656	I will bet you through pay pal . 
2198	656	Not only will I bet you , but I will give you 10-1 odds as well . 
2199	656	is because ASPECT_OBAMA will win ASPECT_ILLINOIS . 
2200	656	ASPECT_ILLINOIS is not even up for debate . 
2201	657	What DEMOCRAT said was partisan ???? 
2202	657	DEMOCRAT said Republicans were incompetent -LRB- they are -RRB- and DEMOCRAT said Democrats are incompetent . 
2203	657	Which side was DEMOCRAT partisan for ? 
2204	657	Simply pointing out how absolutely terrible ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY is , is not partisan unless DEMOCRAT did it only because DEMOCRAT was Democrat . 
2205	657	DEMOCRAT am not , DEMOCRAT think Democrats are almost as bad if not equally as bad . 
2206	658	Good lord what hell are you guys talking about ?? 
2207	658	ASPECT_OBAMA is not significantly worse than ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH . 
2208	658	If you think ASPECT_OBAMA is , you are delusional . 
2209	658	ASPECT_OBAMA has been bad president -LRB- in my opinion -rrb- , but no worse than ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH . 
2210	658	insane hyperbole coming from right , in which they try to pretend ASPECT_OBAMA is worst leader since ASPECT_STALIN , is simply insanity . 
2211	659	You have totally , and I mean totally , missed point . 
2212	660	No I did n't . 
2213	660	EXAMPLE was example of ignorant person decrying how terrible obama is , and how terrible electorate is elected obama . 
2214	660	person who wrote that statement is clearly fool as well , as evidenced by what they wrote . 
2215	660	I bet is one of internet chainmails going about . 
2216	660	Where really stupid people go on and on about who stupid or foolish obama is . 
2217	660	ASPECT_OBAMA is certainly not stupid or foolish . 
2218	660	ASPECT_OBAMA is actually very bright . 
2219	660	ASPECT_OBAMA is simply incompetent president , and like politicians , ASPECT_OBAMA is more worried about pleasing ASPECT_OBAMA campaign financiers and lobbyists , than ASPECT_OBAMA is about doing what is best for country . 
2220	661	She is right in both cases . 
2221	661	ASPECT_OBAMA is ASPECT_POSTER_CHILD for imbicilic incompetence , and people totally ignored ASPECT_OBAMA being mentored politically at ASPECT_YOUNG_AGE by self identified communist , and spiritually mentored by ASPECT_AMERICA hating racist non-christian preacher , have COMMUNIST political career launched at home of murderous domestic terrorist . 
2222	661	How evidence do you fricking need . 
2223	661	If YOU can not see magnificent examples of ASPECT_OBAMA_INCOMPETENCE flowing freely from ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE daily then FRIEND , my young friend , are in desperate need of awakening . 
2224	661	ASPECT_OBAMA is both stupid and foolish added to ASPECT_OBAMA_INCOMPETENCE and corruption and collusion and criminalities is pleaseing no one . 
2225	661	But MY have never been fooled by idiot . 
2227	661	INCOMPETENCE is beyond MY why misses INCOMPETENCE , INCOMPETENCE is so obvious . 
2228	662	If IDEOLOGUE are right wing ideologue , yes . 
2229	662	For sensible people , what you are saying is nonsense . 
2230	663	You know about my ideology , pretending you do is foolish . 
2231	663	MY oppose ASPECT_OBAMA on principle , because ASPECT_OBAMA has none . 
2232	664	We survived ASPECT_FDR who deviated from Constitution than president in history and was original architect behind ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT that WE have today . 
2233	664	Yes , ASPECT_FDR was added to by lbj in ' 60 and by ASPECT_SEVERAL_PRESIDENT who have squandered ASPECT_AMERICA wealth on military interventionism over 60 years but ASPECT_FDR was and worst president when ASPECT_FDR came to complete distain for constitutionally limited government . 
2234	665	While debt has increased in terms , relative to GDP , DEBT declined steadily , including during ASPECT_LBJ term until 1981.Year-Debt GDP1946 121.0 1947 105.7 1948 93.6 1949 94.7 1950 87.5 1951 75.2 1952 72.3 1953 70.1 1954 73.3 1955 67.7 1956 63.3 1957 59.6 1958 60.4 1959 57.2 1960 55.1 1961 54.3 1962 51.7 1963 50.0 1964 47.8 1965 44.6 1966 41.8 1967 41.4 1968 39.3 1969 37.4 1970 37.5 1971 37.6 1972 36.3 1973 34.0 1974 32.8 1975 35.2 1976 35.8 1977 35.4 1978 34.4 1979 33.0 1980 33.4 1981 32.9 1982 36.8 1983 39.9 1984 42.3 1985 46.1 1986 47.6 1987 49.6 1988 51.0 1989 52.1 1990 55.7 1991 61.2 1992 64.1 1993 66.2 
2235	666	Well , is true . 
2236	666	Perhaps was being little melodramatic . 
2237	666	But point remains that ASPECT_OBAMA has made few , if , good decisions . 
2238	666	And came at deliberation and consternation shelled within ASPECT_OBAMA_INABILITY to make decision is driven by principle , ASPECT_OBAMA seeks consencus to even simple things , let alone hard things . 
2239	666	Take ASPECT_OIL_SPILL for instance , ASPECT_OBAMA is pushing SPILL off on ASPECT_BP . 
2240	666	which is not wrong , but ASPECT_OBAMA has taken no leadership role in disaster , instead of getting skimmer recources here as quickly as possible , ASPECT_OBAMA placed ROLE on hold for God only knows what reason , where RECOURCES could have been getting as oil as possible from open water mitigateing amount that reached shore making impact and cleanup more manageable . 
2241	666	As ROLE is , disaster is maximized and efforts of prevention minimized . 
2242	666	ROLE ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2243	667	Well , we have no idea who Repubs will run , or how they will perform , but WE do have Dems in office now so opinion can be given . 
2244	667	So , I would have to assume you are being bias at very least . 
2245	667	I liked rest of your post though ... I may not agree but you presented point well . 
2246	668	Yes , field is wide open . 
2247	668	I do not see ASPECT_PALIN doing well . 
2248	668	People float her name for now , even though HER has not declared , because no names are out there . 
2249	668	But there are alot of quality republicans out there who would do well . 
2250	668	ASPECT_PALIN to I is like ASPECT_OBAMA , looks good , speakes well , but has no depth or experience . 
2251	668	However from hip , even ASPECT_PALIN out shines barry . 
2252	668	But is no achievement of note . 
2253	669	guy who manages to poll well against ASPECT_OBAMA is ASPECT_ROMNEY . 
2254	669	And I have strong doubts Mormon will ever get nominated . 
2255	669	As long as there is halfway decent christian on table like ASPECT_MIKE ASPECT_HUCKABEE ASPECT_ROMNEY does n't stand chance . 
2256	670	Your figures are backward . 
2257	670	No one can suggest forum is overwhelmingly conservative . 
2258	670	Who are you kidding ? 
2259	671	If ASPECT_MUSLIM can get nominated and win Presidency , then ASPECT_MORMON has chance . 
2260	672	Of course you can . 
2261	672	conservative claim board is full of liberals . 
2262	672	liberals claim board is full of conservatives . 
2263	672	And libertarians claim board is full of idiots . 
2264	675	ASPECT_HUMM , could be . 
2265	675	I like them both , and I liked either compared to ASPECT_MCCAIN , whom I admire , just not as president , ASPECT_MCCAIN is too much RINO for I taste . 
2266	675	But I think that ASPECT_JINDAL will be in mix , and in ASPECT_PRESENT_CRISIS in ASPECT_GULF_JINDAL_OUTSHINE_OBAMA , but admittedly , thats not hard to do . 
2267	675	But yet jindal has exercised leadership in vacuum left by ASPECT_OBAMA incompetence . 
2268	675	People need to get over religion . 
2269	675	Wer have closet ASPECT_MUSLIM in there now , how worse could good mormon family man be ? 
2270	676	... he never intended to ... 
2271	677	There is no one in whole of known and unknow universe as far as Hubble may peer , who is more incompetent than ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2272	677	ONE is absolute impossibility . 
2273	677	Off scale even . 
2274	678	's funny . 
2275	678	Republican website does n't show majority against ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL . 
2276	678	In fact , it seems to show just opposite ; that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL did n't go far enough . 
2277	678	And know why OPPOSITE did n't go far enough : ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_OBSTRUCTIONISM . 
2278	679	Just now noticing that huh ? 
2279	680	Please tell me name and location of your doctor . 
2280	680	ME want what doctor is prescribing . 
2281	681	ASPECT_OBAMA and I have doctor . 
2282	681	doctor likes to have patients that counter-balance one another . 
2283	681	You 're either for I or you 're against I . 
2284	682	It makes sense to me now . 
2285	682	On me personal hotline to ASPECT_OVAL_OFFICE , ASPECT_OBAMA told ASPECT_ME_OBAMA was planning to research plague of hallucinatory pyschoses afflicting Republicans . 
2286	683	You actually were n't speaking with ASPECT_OBAMA , it was ASPECT_GIBBS . 
2287	683	Speaking of one who suffers from hallucinatory psychosis , now that man picture is in dictionary for phrase . 
2288	684	Your delusional fixation on ASPECT_OBAMA does not reflect reality . 
2289	684	ASPECT_OBAMA will win ASPECT_ILLINOIS , and I would bet you sum of money to effect . 
2290	685	When ASPECT_MUSLIM does get nominated , please let me know . 
2291	686	ASPECT_BUSH is ASPECT_POSTER_CHILD for imbecilic incompetence . 
2292	686	ASPECT_BUSH did harm to country by acting like bully and bragging about torturing prisoners . 
2293	686	grandchildren and great grandchildren will be ones to pay for ASPECT_BUSH stupidity.right-wingers saw what ASPECT_BUSH administration did to country , yet ONES have audacity to get on here and criticize ASPECT_OBAMA , who kept from going into depression , in spite of having to work with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN congressmen who vote no on issue . 
2294	686	are so fortunate that majority of people in ASPECT_AMERICA were able to see ignorance of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN ASPECT_PARTY play out and decided had had enough of people incompetence . 
2295	686	Conservatives keep repeating lies of conservative media , who main interest is having ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY in office so CONSERVATIVES can get ASPECT_TAX_CUT and get wealthier on back of hard working people . 
2296	686	And dummies that watch conservatives programs are believing everything dummies tell DUMMIES , because DUMMIES are not smart enough to figure out that WEALTHIER is bunch of lies . 
2297	686	If conservatives were able to take CONSERVATIVES bigoted racists blinders off , CONSERVATIVES might be able to see that everything conservative media tells CONSERVATIVES is just bunch of BS . 
2298	686	CONSERVATIVES do n't like ASPECT_OBAMA because ASPECT_OBAMA is black and mostly because ASPECT_OBAMA makes ASPECT_BUSH and cheney look like Dumb and dumber . 
2299	687	I 'm not sure what his doctor is prescribing is good . 
2300	687	It makes you lunatic , do you actually want to subscribe to ? 
2301	688	How do you figure . 
2302	688	Check of polls - it is most certainly mostly rightist ! 
2303	688	of mods are conservative , so explain that . 
2304	689	is funny that you should say that . 
2305	689	ASPECT_US 'm having discussion with another conservative who argues that right wing is not trying to dictate religion into ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AND , that ASPECT_SEPARATION ASPECT_OF ASPECT_CHURCH and state is myth . 
2306	689	claims that FF did not intend for specific religion , but certainly wanted religion into government . 
2307	689	Now , you explain to ASPECT_US , if is case , why would right wing get panties all in wad if WING had been true that ASPECT_OBAMA was ASPECT_MUSLIM ? 
2308	689	After , we do have Muslims living here in us and pay taxes . 
2309	689	THEMSELVES , by your statement have just proven that right-wingers who call themselves Christian do n't practice what right-wingers preach . 
2310	689	RIGHT-WINGERS want to dictate right-wingers beliefs to everyone in country , by law , if RIGHT-WINGERS can , and RIGHT-WINGERS do n't want to extend certain rights to citizens . 
2311	689	True christians would want to be fair , would n't RIGHT-WINGERS ? 
2312	690	So I win if he does n't run for reelection ? 
2313	690	I do n't bet , certainly not for money . 
2314	690	There 's too money in politics as it is . 
2315	690	ASPECT_OBAMA proved IT by ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_MASSIVE_AMOUNT collected during ASPECT_OBAMA run for Presidency . 
2316	690	ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_SOROS is getting soros payback as we write . 
2317	691	Sorry , you must have missed democratic nomination August -LRB- or was that July ? -RRB- 
2319	691	Asleep at wheel again ... 
2320	692	True christians would want you to be saved . 
2321	692	is my hope for you . 
2322	693	Prejudiced and bigoted partisan blinders aside , ASPECT_GOP , patriot americans and fraction of blue dog democrats are aggravated at ASPECT_OBAMA socialist policies and they are progressively bewildered that ASPECT_OBAMA is incompetent cretin . 
2323	693	ASPECT_AMERICA watches apprehensively as `` misguided ASPECT_POLICY_OBAMA enacted in great nation are failing miserably and plainly in ASPECT_EUROPE . 
2324	693	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA possesses no intelligence with which to dictate , no knowledge base with which to lead , and no ideological base is consistent with republic and capitalism . 
2325	693	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA : One term blunder ... 
2326	694	Meanwhile , ASPECT_LBJ tyrannical party spent millions of dollars on unconstitutional war -LRB- ASPECT_U.S. imperialism -RRB- further driving up ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT and interest payment on ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT . 
2327	694	In 1965 , after ASPECT_MEDICAID\/MEDICARE was passed by ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC led ASPECT_CONGRESS and signed into law by ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC president lbj -LRB- klu klux klan member -RRB- , Republicans obtained 47 congressional seats in 1966 . 
2328	694	Ostensibly , history has trend of repeating 1965 . 
2329	696	I thought maybe there would be pretty colors too ? 
2330	697	interesting perspective from neighbors to North and not unlike Americans who would oppose potential candidates ron or ASPECT_RAND_PAUL who unquestionably support Constitutionally limited ASPECT_US ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT . 
2331	697	ASPECT_PALIN does not support limiting ASPECT_U_GOVERNMENT to GOVERNMENT enumerated roles and responsibilities and is , from us perspective , just another ignorant politican perhaps slightly more ignorant than . 
2332	697	But ASPECT_US do find GOVERNMENT somewhat amazing that Americans do not support candidates which believe in adherence to ASPECT_U_CONSTITUTION . 
2333	697	Even `` Constitution party does n't support following Constitution when GOVERNMENT comes to imposing candidates religious beliefs upon ASPECT_AMERICA as platform plank . 
2334	698	BILL never knew even Constitutional party was n't constitutional . 
2335	698	BILL wonder what they were thinking ? 
2336	698	Bob : Well , ASPECT_BILL , ASPECT_BILL think we should establish religious fundamentals in we party . 
2337	698	Bill : we party ? 
2338	698	You mean Constitutional party ? 
2339	698	Bob : Indeed , ASPECT_BILL . 
2340	698	Bill : But is that not , well , unconstitutional ? 
2341	698	Bob : Nonsense ! 
2342	698	Where does bob say that politicians ca n't endorse religion ?! 
2343	698	Bill : Um , right at beginning , ASPECT_BOB . 
2344	698	Bob : BILL bet ASPECT_COMMIES put you up to ! 
2345	698	In seriousness , BILL have very rare particular opinion on ASPECT_OBAMA when ASPECT_BOB comes to Canadians . 
2346	698	Canadians , when asked `` Would you vote for ASPECT_OBAMA ? 
2347	698	, would be quicker to say yes than YES would if asked `` Would you vote for ASPECT_HARPER ? 
2349	699	COIN actually attempted to contact them regarding disparity between Constitution and THEM party platform but of course coin question went unanswered . 
2350	699	Whenever question of Constitutionality is addressed to politicans WHENEVER goes unanswered . 
2351	699	COIN received non-response from COIN senators when COIN question NON-RESPONSE about `` legal tender laws and pointed out that Article I of Constitution only allowed ASPECT_CONGRESS to `` Coin money -LRB- not print currency -RRB- in section 8 and prohibited State from making `` but gold and silver Coin Tender in Payment of Debts in section 10 . 
2352	699	While we do n't have state income tax in wa coin am waiting for day when COIN get check from wa government , perhaps from overpayment of property taxes , so COIN can go to state treasury and demand payment in gold or silver in compliance with Article I section 10 of ASPECT_U_CONSTITUTION . 
2353	699	COIN wonder why no one has done before ? 
2354	699	Perhaps non-response have and COIN am merely unaware of ONE but ONE certainly reflects that `` legal tender laws are unconstitutional imo . 
2355	699	If States can only make payment in gold and silver under Constitution then ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT which is subject to rule of States can not do that which States can not do . 
2356	699	States can not authorize that which NON-RESPONSE are prohibited from doing . 
2357	700	Constitutions , at least in ASPECT_AMERICA and ASPECT_CANADA , seem to be documents are flaunted rather than followed . 
2358	700	More so with ASPECT_AMERICA because of americans ' obsession with ASPECT_AMERICAN founders and constitution , yet of FOUNDERS would vote\/endorse politician breaks constitution . 
2359	700	One of politicians , more explicitly , being ASPECT_MIKE ASPECT_HUCKABEE for example . 
2360	700	It is huge shame Americans do n't take constitution as legal document , but as political holy paper . 
2361	701	First of , you did n't answer my questions , mainly : 
2362	702	blue dog democrat side with Republicans are are more interested in keeping jobs in conservative infested states , than what is good for country , and are in minority , just like reps. calling obama socialist is phrase coined by ASPECT_BUSH limbaugh , repeated by gop media , ASPECT_FOX news and company , and conservatives who have no earthly idea what true socialism is , but find SIDE comforting to make assumption about ASPECT_OBAMA , because way do n't have to expose true reasons , prejudice ad bigotry . 
2363	702	Socialists claim calling ASPECT_OBAMA socialist is ABSURDObama not socialist , I should knowObama ASPECT_TAX_POLICY not Socialist 
2364	703	ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH calls socialist and communists evil people and PEOPLE want to destroy `` country , yet whenever ASPECT_LIMBAUGH defines socialism and communism it 's always psuedo-Stalinism . 
2365	703	ASPECT_GLENN_BECK , on hand , is completely insane . 
2366	703	ASPECT_BECK believes progressives are evil kind of people in world , and ASPECT_BECK thinks ASPECT_WOODROW_WILSON , progressive , created eugenic camps . 
2367	703	truth is , believe ASPECT_SPARTA was to do so . 
2368	705	's because ASPECT_REAGAN was President . 
2369	705	ASPECT_OBAMA is but talking head , ASPECT_EMPTY_SUIT . 
2370	706	implying reagan -LRB- surprised nobody can actually spell reagan name -RRB- was else either . 
2371	707	I am usually very conscientious with spelling but let that one slip by . 
2372	707	SLIP is corrected . 
2373	707	ASPECT_REAGAN was far superior to ASPECT_OBAMA , and compare ASPECT_OBAMA to ASPECT_REAGAN are very insulting to ASPECT_REAGAN . 
2374	708	While ASPECT_OBAMA is anything but competent , I can say about ASPECT_REAGAN . 
2375	708	's just I , though . 
2376	710	It 's actually easy to answer , at least if you are not democrat or liberal-leaning independent . 
2377	710	odds of ASPECT_OBAMA adopting conservative or `` ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PLATFORM during couple of years is extremely remote . 
2378	710	If you are polar opposite of majority of ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICY_TODAY , ASPECT_BET fair bet you 're going to ASPECT_POLAR_OPPOSITE of majority of ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICY come ASPECT_ELECTION_TIME . 
2379	711	He has already adopted much of `` ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PLATFORM . 
2380	711	Most notably on foreign policy issues . 
2381	711	Where HE has changed way president talks , but has done very little to change way president acts . 
2382	711	HE has also failed to pass meaningful financial reform , and appointed ASPECT_TIMOTHY ASPECT_GEITHNER , man who played major role in ASPECT_BUSH administration , as ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TREASURY_SECRETARY . 
2383	711	HE has obviously deviated on issues as well , but narrative right wing fantasy story tellers -LRB- aka fox news and am radio -RRB- have been propagating , about ASPECT_OBAMA radical agenda is completely detached from reality . 
2384	711	There is than enough there for rational and independent minded conservative to like . 
2385	711	TELLERS may not like things , specifically increased spending -LRB- though narrative did n't bother TELLERS under ASPECT_BUSH -rrb- , but there are issues on which TELLERS could come to agreement . 
2386	711	SPENDING just happens that ASPECT_OBAMA sparks irrational hatred among people on right , and causes PEOPLE to invent reasons to hate OBAMA more than reality could ever dictate . 
2387	712	You think ASPECT_OBAMA is different than ASPECT_BUSH ? 
2389	713	I agree that he 's similar to ASPECT_BUSH , particularly in foreign affairs . 
2390	713	As for rest , REST extremely debatable . 
2391	713	ASPECT_BUSH might have been republican , but would seriously call BUSH conservative . 
2392	713	Stating that ASPECT_BUSH adopted ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PLATFORM is stretch of enormous proportions . 
2393	713	Not being able to carry out BUSH original promises does n't equal adoption of opposite stance . 
2394	713	new presidents fail miserable when ADOPTION comes to delivering on presidents campaign promises . 
2395	713	You seem to have pretty strong feelings there , frodly . 
2396	713	Maybe conservatives are n't ones with irrational hatred . 
2397	713	Just because does n't agree with ASPECT_OBAMA does n't mean he 's being called radical . 
2398	713	You seem to be under impression that hatred for opposing team in new ; IMPRESSION not . 
2399	713	democrats were absolutely rabid towards ASPECT_BUSH . 
2400	714	I dislike ASPECT_OBAMA as much as ASPECT_BUSH . 
2401	714	I simply reject conservative position being taken of late , that ASPECT_OBAMA is worst evil politician in world , when reality is , ASPECT_OBAMA is just like pretty politicians . 
2402	714	I should say ASPECT_OBAMA is like ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN politicians , which means lacking in true principles and loyal to interests fund obama campaign and ASPECT_LOBBY_OBAMA on daily basis . 
2403	715	ASPECT_BUSH was much worse then ASPECT_OBAMA , but that still does not make obama good enough for me to vote for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2404	717	Obviously Americans also considered mccain\/palin worse than ASPECT_OBAMA and did vote for ASPECT_OBAMA which is why ASPECT_OBAMA was elected . 
2405	717	2012 elections will probably hinge on fundamental decision . 
2406	717	ASPECT_OBAMA maybe bad but is OBAMA worse than who Republicans will run against ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2407	717	On side note if we compared ASPECT_MCCAIN and palin I would state that ASPECT_MCCAIN was superior to ASPECT_PALIN -LRB- even though ASPECT_MCCAIN is dinosaur of politics -RRB- and ASPECT_PALIN choice obviously hurt ASPECT_MCCAIN in election . 
2408	717	Republicans would certainly reflect absolute stupidity to run worst part of 2008 ticket as 2012 ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE . 
2409	717	Hopefully will actually nominate good candidate but PART is doubtful based upon past history . 
2410	719	One of problems we have is that elections are not carried by voting for candidates so much as voting against candidates . 
2411	719	I believe ASPECT_OBAMA was elected with support of independents who were fundamentally voting against mccain\/palin ticket . 
2412	719	SUPPORT was choice between `` two evils and independents selected lessor of two evils . 
2413	719	Americans will probably be faced with choice in 2012 . 
2414	721	I do n't think so , but you are entitled to your opinion . 
2415	721	ASPECT_OBAMA has done damage in 1 1\/2 years than ASPECT_BUSH did in 8 . 
2416	722	Let see , economy was imperiled by ASPECT_BUSH adminstration lack of attention and neglect of united states while off waging wars based upon unsupported and often false allegations which resulted in as as one million innocent people dying while also leaving government with over trillion dollar budgetary deficit in 2009 and having doubled ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT in 8 years . 
2417	722	FAN 'm not fan of ASPECT_OBAMA but ASPECT_OBAMA is going to have to do quite bit equal damage done to ASPECT_UNITED_STATE by prior adminstration . 
2418	723	I really ca n't see how he 's as ASPECT_BUSH . 
2419	723	HE 's working to get DADT repealed . 
2420	723	HE passed major ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL ASPECT_BUSH would have never touched . 
2421	723	And HE completely reformed healthcare in way ASPECT_BUSH never would have done . 
2422	723	Not to mention HE has sensible tax plan and HE policies are actually improving economy rather than destroying ECONOMY . 
2423	723	HE 's not perfect . 
2424	723	But HE 's leagues above ASPECT_BUSH . 
2425	726	Besides for throw in about globalists -LRB- is small anyways -RRB- , HE agree with almost your post . 
2426	726	HE also voted for ASPECT_OBAMA , and HE now regret NOW and will never vote for ASPECT_OBAMA , or Democrat of kind for matter , ever again . 
2427	726	You are right . 
2428	726	HE was too young to remember ASPECT_CLINTON . 
2429	726	HE became politically aware under ASPECT_BUSH , and HE knew was that ASPECT_BUSH was really terrible president . 
2430	726	HE figured that if we got ASPECT_BUSH out , IMPROVEMENT would be major improvement , and HE really had high expectations for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2431	726	Instead BUSH passed mandate required people to give money to private health care companies . 
2432	726	ASPECT_BUSH has failed to stop rendition , close ASPECT_GUANTANAMO , stop torture , get WE out of ASPECT_IRAQ , open talks with ASPECT_IRAN , etc. . 
2433	726	HE do n't necessarily agree with of issues -LRB- guantanamo for example is just political football , even if WE closed rendition we just would have moved people somewhere else without actually changing anything substantial -rrb- , but if ASPECT_BUSH had lived up to promises rendition would show HE that ASPECT_BUSH is not just politician . 
2434	726	He of course has not . 
2435	726	HE now realize is NOW is political theater . 
2436	726	There is no right wing or ASPECT_LEFT_WING_MEDIUM , there is corporate media . 
2437	726	ASPECT_NBC , ASPECT_FOX , ASPECT_CNN , and ASPECT_NEWS_NETWORK receive revenues from advertising dollars from corporations . 
2438	726	ASPECT_CNN is interests of corporations media represents , not ideological viewpoint . 
2439	726	CORPORATIONS simply need to have fox news distract right wingers from legitimate issues facing country , and ASPECT_MEDIUM_SOURCE to distract people from legitimate problems facing country . 
2440	726	As you said , who thinks there is major difference between Democrats and republicans in action is twit . 
2441	726	There rhetoric may be radically different , but when was time conservative balanced budget and when was time liberal passed significant piece of social welfare legislation was not just giant handout to ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PROVIDER ? 
2442	726	ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_REAGAN spent like drunk sailors , and ASPECT_CLINTON gutted welfare . 
2443	726	SAILORS do n't actually live up to rhetoric SAILORS spout . 
2444	726	It is simply way to keep normal people of country occupied . 
2445	726	So PEOPLE make up fake issues like ASPECT_OBAMA is socialist , or look at how ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN spent on shoes , or ASPECT_MICHAEL ASPECT_JACKSON died -LRB- even better -RRB- , or element of political or pop culture circus to distract us from political realities currently facing country . 
2446	728	video is put together by schizophrenic lunatic , and who takes EMBARRASSMENT seriously is embarrassment to human race . 
2447	728	With legitimate criticisms can be made of politician , ASPECT_BARRACK_OBAMA very much included , why are right wingers obsessed with insane and off wall criticisms . 
2448	728	ASPECT_OBAMA was actually born in ASPECT_KENYA !! 
2449	728	ASPECT_OBAMA is marxist !! 
2450	728	OBAMA never actually went to college . 
2451	728	And on and on . 
2452	728	I see stuff , and can not imagine how human being could take BEING seriously , and height worries I to no end , to know that people do in fact take HEIGHT seriously . 
2453	728	HEIGHT is height of irrationality . 
2454	728	I try to give people benefit of doubt as as is possible , but many of right wingers on forum make FORUM very difficult . 
2455	729	Say what you want . 
2456	729	I do n't trust guy . 
2457	729	History will show GUY is fraud . 
2458	730	I do n't trust AGENT either !! 
2459	730	does n't mean I think AGENT is actually muslim marxist double agent from ASPECT_KENYA !! 
2460	732	ASPECT_OBAMA is one of conservative democrats to run in awhile . 
2461	732	On global ASPECT_STANDARD_OBAMA center right . 
2462	732	of major accomplishments have been too conservative for on left . 
2463	733	You are out of your mind man . 
2464	733	Name one president who passed -LRB- borrowed from chinese -RRB- 800 BILLION dollar `` stimulus and passed 4 trillion dollar healthcare welfare plan for fat lazy poor people to get free drugs . 
2465	733	Osama is by far extreme lefty to ever step foot in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE . 
2466	733	And look what happens . 
2467	733	.10 unemployment and 6 million lost jobs 
2468	734	Just because he has n't come through on various things promised does n't necessarily mean HE leans less to left than previouslythought . 
2469	734	It just means that HE has failed to accomplish what was promised . 
2470	735	Yeah , you 're right , ASPECT_BUSH only spent 700 billion in BUSH days and spent 11 trillion largely on war of choice in ASPECT_IRAQ . 
2471	736	ASPECT_BUSH passed 1.8 trillion dollar stimulus comprised completely of corporate ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
2472	736	also BUSH 600 dollar tax rebate stimulus cost about 150 billion . 
2473	736	ASPECT_REAGAN ASPECT_TAX_CUT cost us even than ASPECT_BUSH as percentage of ASPECT_US GDP . 
2474	737	war for 7 years while ASPECT_BUSH was in office was 600 Billion dollars , for 7 years of war . 
2475	737	Where in hell are you getting 11 trillion dollars brah ? 
2476	740	You know , thats good question . 
2477	740	I do believe I heard QUESTION but now I 'm not sure . 
2478	740	I 'll cop to . 
2479	740	I withdraw figure and apologize . 
2480	740	Seriously , I apologize . 
2481	741	Get on bandwagon my friend !! 
2482	741	MY will either not vote , or vote for independent liberal . 
2483	741	MY would vote for ASPECT_NADER , but MY do n't think LIBERAL will run again . 
2484	741	Hopefully one takes ASPECT_LIBERAL place , and MY will vote for them . 
2485	742	I 'll end up voting for 'll get like 0.3 of vote , but at least I 'll feel better . 
2486	742	God knows I 'm not voting Republican . 
2487	743	Yep here . 
2488	743	I will vote for one who gets almost no votes , but I will feel better than voting for ASPECT_OBAMA or Democrat , and I would never vote for Republican either . 
2489	744	ASPECT_REAGAN ASPECT_TAX_CUT did no . 
2490	744	was spending increases on thepart of democrat controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
2491	745	How will assisting in your sides loss make you feel better ? 
2492	746	If ASPECT_OBAMA runs again , I think ASPECT_OBAMA will win . 
2493	746	But independent of , why should I vote for anybody for reason than because I agree with them ? 
2494	747	ASPECT_OBAMA has n't really changed ASPECT_OBAMA_PHILOSOPHICAL_STANCE on issues , what 's `` not to agree with ? 
2495	748	I would have voted for him in 2008 if I was old enough to . 
2496	748	HIM ran to left of where HIM been during him time in office . 
2497	748	I do n't think 's debatable . 
2498	749	I most certainly is debatable , Just because he has failed to come through on certaincampaign promises does n't mean HE 's changed HE philisophicalstances . 
2499	749	It simply means HE failed to come through as promised . 
2500	750	It 's not that ASPECT_SOCIALIST has n't come through , IT 's how ASPECT_SOCIALIST goes about not coming through , SOCIALIST dig ? 
2501	750	SOCIALIST too willing to compromise to nth degree with party will vote against everything nth or Democrats propose , party has significant portion believes ASPECT_SOCIALIST is Socialist and\/or SOCIALIST not even citizen of country . 
2502	751	ASPECT_OBAMA will receive your vote again . 
2503	751	When election finally gets here you 'll realize even more just how important your vote is , and will not want to waste VOTE on nobody candidate . 
2504	751	You will then hold your noseand hit switch for ASPECT_OBAMA once again . 
2505	752	Would n't it be good to see him push for him policies even when HIM does n't have votes at time when bill is introduced ? 
2506	752	I totally agree with your post on HIM being pragmatic . 
2507	752	However , there is time to go with crowd and there is time to lead . 
2508	752	I have n't seen him lead much . 
2510	753	He could care less what republicans want . 
2511	753	What happened with ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE should be plentyevidence of . 
2512	754	They threw in bunch of amendments I do recall . 
2513	755	amendments mean little to in overall scheme of things . 
2514	755	What 's important is that none of republicans voted for it . 
2515	756	They were n't going to vote for it no matter what he proposed . 
2516	757	I guarantee you that I wo n't . 
2517	758	No , it means NO rhetoric does not match NO action . 
2518	758	I do n't care what ASPECT_OBAMA says ASPECT_OBAMA believes , I do n't care what ASPECT_OBAMA_PHILOSOPHICAL_STANCE are , I care what ASPECT_OBAMA_ACTION are . 
2519	758	ASPECT_OBAMA_ACTION are unacceptable . 
2520	758	For I to forgive actions because I agree with of things ASPECT_OBAMA says would be very stupid . 
2521	759	No what is important is that there was no ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION , and there was mandate . 
2522	759	mandate is basically giant handout to ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PROVIDER . 
2523	759	There has also been no significant financial reform . 
2524	759	No further environmental reform . 
2525	759	No comprehensive progressive energy bill . 
2526	759	Republicans voted against COMPREHENSIVE as political theater . 
2527	759	They spent year convincing THEY followers that ASPECT_OBAMA was evil socialist , and that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM was example of evil socialism . 
2528	759	YEAR would have been impossible for THEY to have then voted for bill . 
2529	759	YEAR also perpetuates myth that there is fundamental difference between 2 parties . 
2530	759	Both parties are controlled by special and corporate interests , and persuaded by lobbyists on daily basis . 
2531	759	SPECIAL is interests of groups both parties represent , not overarching ideology . 
2532	759	Why would I vote for one party over , when outcomes on important issue are going to be pretty much . 
2533	760	Even if were true , so what ? 
2534	760	ASPECT_DEMOCRATS managed to win super majority and ASPECT_REPUBLICANS did n't `` and still do n't have power to stop anything . 
2535	761	They do n't have to as as Democrats ' majority does that for THEY . 
2536	761	All ASPECT_GOP has to do is vote no. . 
2537	762	What ever direction gop votes right now is irrelevant . 
2538	762	They simply do n't have numbers to stop democrats . 
2539	763	Democrats stop Democrats . 
2540	763	's point . 
2541	764	You 're kind of missing point , point being said that his recent actions -LRB- or lack thereof -RRB- is proof that HIS has of sudden shifted right philosophically . 
2542	764	I believe when KIND comes to HIS ideology HIS is as liberal as HIS ever was . 
2543	765	If process gets stopped up with of democratscurrently in office then you need to focus on what wrong with THEN , not republicans . 
2544	766	I am . 
2545	766	's been focus of I posts in thread . 
2546	766	Btw , FOCUS looks like you 're posting in ASPECT_BLANK verse lol . 
2547	767	What are you saying ?? 
2548	767	supports my position , POSITION does not weaken POSITION . 
2549	767	Democrats had super majority for almost year . 
2550	767	They could have gotten ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION , financial reform , reformed ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY in liberal fashion , improved welfare state , etc. . 
2551	767	What did THEY do instead ? 
2552	767	THEY got almost done in year , and then blamed Republicans for stopping THEY , when as you pointed out , Republicans had no means by which to stop THEY . 
2553	767	So THEY are full of -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -rrb- -LRB- -RRB- . 
2554	767	Why would MY vote for THEY ? 
2555	768	is because your belief is clearly based on irrational partisanship . 
2556	768	If you instead based your beliefs on reality , your beliefs would quickly change . 
2557	770	Does mean yes then ? 
2558	770	Or is MEAN as no , which would then make me think you could just use no option available ... 
2559	771	I give you props for . 
2561	772	I also vote for . 
2562	773	Remember , is what ASPECT_REPUBLICAN leader , ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH , wants . 
2563	773	ASPECT_LIMBAUGH wants ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA to fail , as do of republicans . 
2564	773	do n't care if hurts ASPECT_AMERICA , as long as Rush is happy ! 
2565	774	interestingthere are estimated 20 million people who listen to ASPECT_LIMBAUGH . 
2566	774	I do n't know if is occasional listeners or type of solid daily . 
2567	774	There are approx 55 million registered republicans . 
2568	774	We will leave out IndependentsSo , you assume to know what limbaugh thinks . 
2569	774	INDEPENDENTSSO has been clear that ASPECT_INDEPENDENTSSO wants country to succeed . 
2570	774	You also assume that 20 million listeners will do exactly as they are told by ASPECT_LIMBAUGHWHAT then becomes of 35 million who do n't listen ? 
2571	774	do you have talking points ? 
2572	774	I have good site you may likewww.mybarackobama.com 
2573	775	If you do n't believe ASPECT_LIMBAUGH is gop leader , just ask ASPECT_LIMBAUGH ! 
2574	777	Your right he would be dead . 
2575	778	You have his phone ? 
2576	778	seems anti ASPECT_AMERICAN leftist are ones actually listen to LEFTIST , I know of no one does . 
2577	779	Ridicules speculation , no proof . 
2579	781	Thank you , have n't seen or listened to him since HIM had evening tv show ... . 
2581	781	probably going on 20 or so years ? 
2582	783	Very astute point . 
2583	783	If guy ca n't pick dog with alacrity , GUY has no business being president . 
2584	785	How did it take for him to decide to accept help to plug -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -lrb- -RRB- ed hole ? 
2585	785	is destroying peoples lives and jobs . 
2586	786	does n't take rocket scientist to figure out when `` says I want ASPECT_OBAMA to fail , is as saying `` SCIENTIST want country to fall . 
2587	786	ASPECT_OBAMA failure would only be seen\/recognized if country was in toilet , as was seen when ASPECT_BUSH was in office . 
2588	786	Fortunately , FAILURE was near end of ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM and Americans had sense enough not to vote in ASPECT_OBAMA_CLONE with ASPECT_OBAMA_AIRHEAD_COHORT . 
2589	787	day , I believe . 
2590	788	Are you sure ? 
2591	788	Because we heard on Faux news that NEWS took him month ! 
2592	788	-LRB- Just kidding -RRB- . 
2593	788	But , FACT is fact , Faux news commentators are still claiming that no foreign ships have been allowed to help , but is not true . 
2594	788	As usual , ASPECT_FOX news spreads lies before doing fact checking . 
2595	788	administration says foreign vessels are already helping to combat worst ASPECT_U.S. oil spill so blanket waiver isn needed . 
2596	788	There are lot of foreign vessels operating offshore , coast guard admiral ASPECT_THAD ASPECT_ALLEN , government s incident commander , told reporters on June 25 . 
2597	788	coast guard would be happy to aid in requests for waivers , but to date , since REPORTERS re operating outside 3 miles , no jones act waiver has been required . 
2599	789	Come on now kenyan navy does n't count . 
2600	791	YouTube - ASPECT_JAMES ASPECT_CARVILLE vs. ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH You really need to listen to , ASPECT_RUSH explains carville stance perfectly . 
2601	791	I want ASPECT_OBAMA to fail as well . 
2602	791	MINUTES 3 minutes , please listen , 3 gives perfect example . 
2603	792	's right . 
2604	792	do n't like ASPECT_OBAMA policies so want economy to fail because will help ASPECT_OBAMA be defeated . 
2605	792	If couple million americans lose jobs , savings , and homes , 's OK as long as MILLION leads to ASPECT_REPUBLICAN victory . 
2606	792	We see attitude from of conservatives . 
2607	792	Very patriotic . 
2608	793	Did you even watch video ? 
2609	793	I do n't want country to turn socialist , ASPECT_OBAMA_SUCCEEDING means . 
2610	793	Why would I want ? 
2611	793	's not ASPECT_AMERICA . 
2612	793	I do n't care if you think I 'm patriotic or not , I 'm way of ASPECT_AMERICAN than you will ever be . 
2614	794	If economy grows and is successful , then ASPECT_OBAMA succeeds . 
2615	794	Which rush and ASPECT_OBAMA_ACOLYTE are against -LRB- because ASPECT_OBAMA might raise acolytes taxes and ASPECT_OBAMA 'd have to buy smaller mansion -rrb- . 
2616	794	Thus ASPECT_OBAMA wants economy to fail , even if millions americans lose millions jobs and homes , because then ASPECT_OBAMA fails . 
2617	794	Which is why Rush and murdoch mouthpieces constantly emphaisize negative about economy and ignore positives . 
2618	794	MILLIONS know that if MILLIONS can help create less confidence in economy , will help drag ASPECT_M.O. down . 
2619	794	has been ASPECT_M.O. since day 1 . 
2620	794	Very patriotic . 
2621	795	Ah , racism . 
2622	795	gotta love gotta . 
2623	796	He was n't talking about economy . 
2624	796	economy is going to fail under ASPECT_OBAMA regardless because ASPECT_OBAMA has no idea what ASPECT_OBAMA is doing . 
2625	796	ECONOMY 's about socialism\/communism . 
2626	796	We do n't want government having control and telling WE what to do ! 
2627	796	WE would rather see higher ASPECT_TAX_RATE than . 
2628	796	WE want we freedoms in great capitalistic society . 
2629	796	American who wants government controlling things in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR is just wrong and completely un-american . 
2630	798	Turn on Rush on given day and he is constantly talking about how badly economy is doing . 
2631	798	ASPECT_IMO , if you feel way , patriotic and ASPECT_AMERICAN to do would be to try to elect representatives who share your view and you can repeal ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and deprive tens of millions of Americans of health care coverage and everything will be hunky dory for you again like CARE was . 
2632	798	But hoping economy goes to -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- can so obama fails while millions lose millions jobs and homes is not . 
2633	798	In my opinion . 
2634	799	Will I take who calls obama `` hussien seriously ??? 
2636	800	Nah , it was trap to see who would drag out racism tag ... congratulations you won . 
2637	801	It is obvious that you are so into Rush that you fail to see what he says to mean than what HE tries to explain that it means . 
2638	801	country is not football team competing to win game . 
2639	801	If ASPECT_OBAMA fails , means ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICY have put country in jeopardy . 
2640	801	country loses . 
2641	801	Your conservative policies did just to country , and came pretty darn close to failing . 
2642	801	Why is so hard for conservatives to understand ? 
2643	801	There is no failure for ASPECT_OBAMA without country failing . 
2644	801	Sorry , I 'm not comatose , I know exactly what rush meant , no matter how RUSH tries to sugar coat matter . 
2645	801	man is idiot . 
2646	802	Ah , so by making racist comment , you then catch racists ? 
2647	802	Conservative logic ? 
2648	803	Actually ASPECT_OBAMA is idiot . 
2649	803	ASPECT_OBAMA does opposite of what public wants on topic . 
2650	803	Rush ca n't harm country , ASPECT_OBAMA can and ASPECT_OBAMA is . 
2651	806	Yeah , I see higher earning capacity for americans and freedoms with ASPECT_OBAMA ever-increasing bureaucracy . 
2652	807	world pariah ? 
2653	807	Since when has united states been anything but powerful political force on planet ? 
2654	807	And `` laughing stock ? 
2655	807	Maybe you care what elitist european snobs think about country but I sure as hell do n't . 
2656	807	SNOBS can kiss I big fat ASPECT_AMERICAN butt . 
2657	807	outlandish hyperbole . 
2658	807	Under ASPECT_REAGAN , economy boomed and millions of new jobs were created , and what ASPECT_CIVIL_RIGHT were eroded during reagan term , specifically ? 
2659	807	And I guess you forgot who bailed out rich bankers and received campaign contributions from ASPECT_GOLDMAN_SACH . 
2660	807	would be ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2661	807	ASPECT_P.S. - I noticed your vote has to do with how good ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA has been or would be . 
2662	807	speaks volumes ... 
2663	811	Not really . 
2664	811	liberals are getting fed up with ASPECT_OBAMA and you should to . 
2665	811	Also , right cares more about politics than average leftist . 
2666	812	And you 're basing on ? 
2668	813	Even if I 'm not all that pleased with ASPECT_OBAMA , I 'll still vote for ASPECT_OBAMA over unnamed ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
2669	814	Obviously we disagree . 
2670	814	Do HIS remember during ASPECT_REAGAN second term when his alzheimers became so severe announcement was made that ASPECT_REAGEN was efficient leader reagen only worked 40 hours week ? 
2671	814	Read between lines . 
2672	814	Did you ever hear ASPECT_MAGGIE ASPECT_THATCHER quote about ASPECT_REAGAN ? 
2673	814	`` ASPECT_THATCHER 's dear but there is absolutely between thatcher ears . 
2674	816	I doubt 's true . 
2675	816	I see liberals and libertarians saying LIBERALS would n't vote for him . 
2676	816	It does n't mean conservatives outnumber left by 2 to 1 . 
2677	817	ASPECT_LIBERALS ASPECT_CLAIMING ASPECT_REPUBLICANS ASPECT_OUTNUMBER ASPECT_DEMOCRATS 2:1 on board ... 
2678	818	ASPECT_PELOSI , reid , boxer , frank , dodd , wiggins , ASPECT_RANGLE and republican personal favorite , lunatic that thinks ASPECT_GUAM is going to tip over . 
2679	818	If of liberal people in wiggins districts did least bit of research , PEOPLE would never have been voted in than once . 
2680	818	So PEOPLE either do n't care , do n't pay attention , or PEOPLE do care and are just stupid . 
2681	818	And for record , REPUBLICAN am not ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
2682	818	REPUBLICAN am of opinion that politicians are crooks . 
2683	818	Politicians are like diapers , POLITICIANS need to be changed often and for reason . 
2684	820	No liberalism is liberalism at LIBERALISM finest to not recognize joke and want to call NO racism . 
2685	820	So congratulations to you for your jump on bandwagon of ASPECT_NAME_CALLING . 
2686	821	So , in words , terrible source . 
2687	821	goes for Republicans get re-elected for eternity . 
2688	821	Incumbency is very high , no matter party . 
2689	821	To make statement based on happens on both sides just does n't work . 
2690	822	You do n't need them . 
2691	822	mr. president is showing world president `` amazing ability just fine without THEM . 
2692	822	great job president doing should have PRESIDENT re-elected in no time flat ! 
2693	822	BTW , I voted for ASPECT_MCCAIN . 
2694	823	Actually I agree with you . 
2695	823	liberals are always terrible source . 
2696	824	Forums in general are terrible sources . 
2697	824	Because then we have posters using `` sources like to make broad proclomation . 
2698	825	Well I was using liberals own words to prove I point . 
2699	825	We care because WE form things like tea-party . 
2700	825	WE speak out and WE do n't let government tell WE what to do . 
2701	826	I 'll say . 
2702	826	FWIW , ASPECT_AMERICAN_RIGHT is more consolidated and focused than Left , and thus we have groups like ASPECT_TEA_PARTY . 
2703	826	But does RIGHT mean groups know or care ? 
2704	826	Not necessarily . 
2705	827	Actually it 's showing that people are becoming smarter . 
2706	827	I do n't know how anybody could possibly vote for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2707	827	OBAMA full of -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- . 
2708	827	OBAMA lies . 
2709	827	Does n't care what people want . 
2710	827	OBAMA destined to drive country straight into ground . 
2711	827	candidate we put out there will be better candidate than ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2712	828	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , ASPECT_RON_PAUL ... was easy . 
2713	829	Wake up . 
2714	829	ASPECT_OBAMA approval rating are in free fall mode right now . 
2715	829	ASPECT_OBAMA has n't done anything positive since ASPECT_OBAMA was in office . 
2716	829	we do is spend , spend , and spend , which equates to waste , waste , and waste . 
2717	829	ASPECT_OBAMA will not be re-elected in 2012 , 2012 's just simple . 
2718	830	Not like we do n't have over 2 years left until election . 
2719	830	Hardly had even heard about ASPECT_OBAMA 2 years before November of 2008 . 
2720	831	I believe liberals are hoping for . 
2721	831	ASPECT_RON_PAUL has had plenty of chances ... 
2722	832	Anybody but obama at point . 
2723	832	ASPECT_OBAMA 's not going to win and POINT quite evident . 
2724	833	's what liberals said about ASPECT_GW_BUSH before ASPECT_BUSH second run . 
2725	833	`` anybody was ASPECT_JOHN_KERRY , and ASPECT_KERRY simply would n't do . 
2726	833	ANYBODY 'd be careful making claims this early . 
2727	834	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN is joke . 
2728	834	If she wins ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRIMARY -LRB- which I admit , is disturbingly possible , -RRB- then ASPECT_OBAMA win in 2012 is practically assured . 
2729	834	Heck , if ASPECT_PALIN ASPECT_OBAMA_OPPONENT , I 'll be voting for ASPECT_PALIN . 
2730	834	ASPECT_RON_PAUL ... 's trickier . 
2731	834	PAUL got good grassroots movement , and ASPECT_PAUL actually uses internet -LRB- as do paul followers -RRB- . 
2732	834	problem is , Republicans want to tank paul hard . 
2733	834	fact that ASPECT_PAUL conservative hurts PAUL here . 
2734	834	ASPECT_PAUL criticizes paul party as much as ASPECT_PAUL does Democrats -LRB- indeed , I found out today while watching youtube clip of interview with ASPECT_RON_PAUL that ASPECT_PAUL expressed sentiment I express time . 
2735	834	Granted INTERVIEW was old interview , so PAUL probably used INTERVIEW first . 
2736	834	Republicans were brought in to fix things , and INDEED just made things worse . 
2737	834	So Democrats were brought in to fix things , and INDEED did just what indeed said INDEED would : increase spending and taxes . -RRB- 
2738	834	But I do n't think ASPECT_PAUL has chance . 
2739	834	ASPECT_PAUL 'll have establishment of both parties against ASPECT_PAUL . 
2740	834	Not to mention media -LRB- or specifically ASPECT_FOX news -RRB- hates ASPECT_PAUL . 
2741	835	Groups that being `` focused does n't mean they are correct , evidences strong propaganda and absence of free thought . 
2742	835	ASPECT_AMERICA today is nowhere near as free as ASPECT_AMERICA used to be fifty years ago . 
2743	835	Freedom of thought today is criticized . 
2744	835	How can you say like above , `` ASPECT_AMERICAN_RIGHT is ... consolidated and focused ... ? 
2745	835	So was german right in 1934 . 
2746	836	I get what you are saying . 
2747	836	I really like ASPECT_PAUL . 
2748	836	I think ASPECT_PAUL will be able to get quite liberal votes for president if ASPECT_PAUL was able to win ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRIMARY . 
2749	839	ASPECT_OBAMA 2nd term is guaranteed . 
2750	839	Even if ASPECT_OBAMA does n't win , OBAMA 'll get TERM . 
2751	839	See ASPECT_BUSH 2 terms for example . 
2752	839	Independents decide vote . 
2753	839	No way did independents vote for ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_BUSH 2nd term . 
2754	839	And no way will INDEPENDENTS vote ASPECT_OBAMA for ASPECT_BUSH . 
2755	839	's why INDEPENDENTS can make move after move Americans do n't want and still walk with independents heads high . 
2756	839	Honestly , how could we ever know that election was n't rigged in country ? 
2757	839	Trust , please . 
2758	840	Probably not liberals but conservative democrats , conservatives alone outnumber liberals and folks in middle lean conservative i 've noticed . 
2759	841	I agree they put extremist ASPECT_BUSH in for two terms , now THEY need good liberal for 2 terms to clean up mess left behind . 
2760	842	It 's funny you , or , knows who\/what candidates will be . 
2761	842	Not YOU . 
2762	842	YOU will watch and see . 
2763	843	LIBERAL did n't say they were correct . 
2764	843	read liberal post again . 
2765	843	LIBERAL 'm liberal . 
2766	843	LIBERAL 'm telling you now that LIBERAL wo n't be voting Republican . 
2767	843	LIBERAL guarantee NOW . 
2768	845	We would have saved lot of money if WE would have plugged his hole ... 
2769	846	Ohhhh , about 13 of population , , , ASPECT_HAHAHAHAHAAHAH . 
2771	848	I do n't think so I think his name had lot to do with HIS being elected . 
2772	848	sounded exotic and so foreign , now leroy or wille for matter would have been just another name would n't have garnered interest . 
2773	848	ASPECT_BARACK may have problems getting people interested in ASPECT_BARACK , barack name or barack policies next ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_ELECTION . 
2774	849	If it is necessary I will be totally shocked at gullibility of voters . 
2775	851	What does even mean ? 
2776	852	I do n't think there will ever be as gullibility as there was when ASPECT_BUSH won second time ! 
2777	853	Oh come on , you can read ! 
2778	854	Yes , I 'm well aware of . 
2779	854	I 'm just not sure of what point you 're trying to make . 
2780	855	POINT was n't my point . 
2781	855	Was POINT ? 
2782	855	Stay on point . 
2783	856	Well whoever it was . 
2784	857	are so right gullibility was time ASPECT_OBAMA was elected . 
2786	857	you ca n't top that even with whipped cream and cherry . 
2787	858	well now you are contributing . 
2788	859	You miss my point . 
2789	859	MY am saying polity is managed almost beyond bounds of truly free choice . 
2790	862	Yeah dreams are to live off ass . 
2791	863	Have to redistribute wealth . 
2792	863	Do liberals really want -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ??? 
2793	863	Do n't LIBERALS realize that road to totalitarianism is redistribution of wealth ??? 
2794	864	road to slavery is on end . 
2795	864	Slave masters were great capitalists in capitalists time , ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHER . 
2796	865	's point of ASPECT_INCOME_TAX . 
2797	865	To distribute wealth . 
2798	865	WAY 's not road to totalitarianism . 
2799	865	WAY way to keep economy from being controled completely by one group of people . 
2800	865	WAY way to insure have ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS . 
2801	867	So is providing and education for everyone . 
2802	868	You might want to check ASPECT_CURRENT_EVENT here : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.realclearpolitics.com \ \/ epo...oval-1044 . 
2802	868	htmlThis is polls , left , right , and center . 
2803	868	Currently on NO poll is bo gaining and on no poll is ASPECT_BO at 50 . 
2804	868	BO decline has been steady and consistent even by left leaning media . 
2805	868	man is simply middle management type at best . 
2806	868	MAN would NOT become executive in business . 
2807	868	MAN lacks skills . 
2808	869	Independents are under 40 for him according to Gallup , 's stunning for HIM . 
2809	869	Do n't listen to Mertex , MERTEX stopped looking after election ... LOL ... 
2811	870	ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS is redistributing to low class . 
2812	870	ASPECT_OBAMA wants no low class . 
2813	870	People are in low class now are model citizens in ASPECT_OBAMA_MIND . 
2814	870	CITIZENS deserve people to `` give people money that PEOPLE did n't earn . 
2815	870	I ca n't believe you do n't see problem with redistribution of wealth . 
2816	870	PROBLEM completely wrong and unethical . 
2817	871	You ca n't convince of them on left , are die hard believers in rising star status of ASPECT_OBAMA . 
2818	871	OBAMA could drop to zero on polls and would see ASPECT_OBAMA at 50 or better . 
2819	874	Yeah that dirty commie ASPECT_ADAM ASPECT_SMITH was for . 
2820	875	ASPECT_HIGH_POINT is over . 
2821	877	I guess you missed where ONE said through July 4 , 2010 ! 
2822	877	was tough one . 
2823	880	At point in his presidency , ASPECT_REAGAN approval rating was around 45 and falling . 
2824	880	Less than half approved of HIS performance at time . 
2825	880	And HIS had had advantage of being shot . 
2826	880	http : \ \/ \ \/ online.wsj.com \ \/ public\/resourc ... pp0605-31 .

2827	883	You call being shot advantage ? 
2828	883	Maybe 's your idea of good time , but IDEA not mine and ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_REAGAN . 
2829	884	For popularity purposes it is . 
2830	885	's very interesting . 
2831	885	ASPECT_IMO , what you have to look at then is future actions . 
2832	885	If ASPECT_BARACK takes barack cues from ASPECT_REAGAN , have no doubt ASPECT_BARACK will win reelection in landslide just like ASPECT_REAGAN did . 
2833	886	Pass big ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE in his 3d year like ASPECT_REAGAN did ? 
2834	886	We can only hope ASPECT_OBAMA does n't follow ASPECT_REAGAN example on deficits . 
2835	886	So far ASPECT_OBAMA is though . 
2836	887	If he had slashed ASPECT_TAX_RATE , HE could get away with small tax rate increase . 
2838	887	Exactly which `` big ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE are you referring to ? 
2839	887	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.taxfoundation.org\/publications\/show\/151.html I love HTTP : \ \/ \ \/ WWW.TAXFOUNDATION.ORG\/PUBLICATIONS\/SHOW\/151.HTML when barack supporters talk about responsible spending . 
2841	888	Unfortunately , unlike ASPECT_REAGAN , we do n't have luxury today -LRB- in part because of reagan policies -RRB- of having low debt to gdp ratio where WE can afford to triple deficits and debt . 
2842	888	ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY in 1983 , and Deficit reduction act 1984 I agree . 
2843	888	I supported ASPECT_CLINTON because she was one who was serious about issue and had best plan to address deficits . 
2844	889	ME do n't care what economy is doing , it is never good idea to try to spend your way into prosperity . 
2846	889	ME gave you link to ASPECT_TAX_RATE . 
2847	889	ME believe you are confusing ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE with ASPECT_TAX_RATE . 
2848	889	Show me where ASPECT_PERSONAL_INCOME_TAX_RATE went up . 
2849	889	ME 'm not saying they did n't . 
2850	889	ME just ca n't find it . 
2851	889	ASPECT_MCCAIN may not have been great candidate , but ASPECT_MCCAIN had far credibility on ASPECT_SPENDING_ISSUE than of democrats . 
2852	890	I agree . 
2853	890	IDEA can be good idea to spend your way out of recession\/depression cycle , however . 
2854	890	I did n't say ASPECT_PERSONAL_INCOME_TAX_RATE went up .

2859	892	So in your mind , 15 unemployment is preferable to larger deficit and debt ? 
2860	892	largest problem with argument , is that when you have recession or depression , you will lose amounts of revenue anyways . 
2861	892	You could say , we need to cut spending in response to decreases in revenue , but would lead to very undesirable economic outcomes . 
2862	892	WE could also raise taxes to make up for loss in revenue , again problem is will also lead to undesirable economic outcomes . 
2863	892	So how do you deal with problem ? 
2864	892	answer is , ANSWER is very difficult in we current political climate . 
2865	892	It is n't very difficult solution either , but ASPECT_POLITICAL_POSTURING makes sane economic decisions almost impossible . 
2866	892	What one with knowledge of economics would say , is that you balance budget over ASPECT_BUSINESS_CYCLE , not on year to year basis . 
2867	892	Which means spending and ASPECT_TAX_POLICY should fluctuate . 
2868	892	When is recession or depression , you raise spending and cut taxes , which then stimulates economy . 
2869	892	When economy is booming , you cut spending and raise taxes . 
2870	892	economy can handle changes in times of prosperity , and then you make up for deficits are accrued during tough economic times . 
2871	892	problem is ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY is not particularly rational . 
2872	892	Neither side ever cuts spending during good economic times , and Republicans oppose ASPECT_TAX_HIKE at times . 
2873	892	makes conducting policy in reasonable way , meaning balancing budget over ASPECT_BUSINESS_CYCLE , almost impossible . 
2874	892	Instead have Republicans who want to cut taxes , without actually enacting ASPECT_SPENDING_CUT , while economy is strong . 
2875	892	And democrats who want to raise taxes , but want to do so even when ECONOMY is economically inadvisable . 
2876	892	ECONOMY is economic posturing , and ECONOMY is very bad for country . 
2877	893	Nice leap of logic . 
2878	893	I believe that ASPECT_BARACK spending spree cost jobs and prevented growth . 
2879	893	ASPECT_IMO , ASPECT_IMO has changed slow recovery into stagnate one . 
2880	893	Do math . 
2881	894	No , I am not making leap in logic . 
2882	894	I was asking you hypothetical question . 
2883	894	I was not claiming that without increased spending , we would have 15 &#37; unemployment , though I feel confident spending would be higher . 
2884	894	I am asking simple hypothetical and philosophical question about importance of combating unemployment measured against importance of combating debt . 
2885	895	question does not make sense . 
2886	895	ASPECT_SPENDING_BILL hurt recovery , ASPECT_IMO . 
2887	896	question makes perfect sense . 
2888	896	Despite your beliefs , idea that ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING stimulates economy is not very controversial among economists . 
2889	896	It is widely accepted to be true -LRB- though minority does exist questions that fact -RRB- . 
2890	896	You may believe that stimulus did not do enough to justify STIMULUS costs , but to claim stimulus hurt recovery , is first of unprovable , and second of actually leap of logic on your part . 
2891	896	What evidence do you have to support your claim that stimulus hurt recovery ? 
2892	896	What ASPECT_ECONOMIC_REASONING do you have , if no evidence exists ? 
2893	896	Simply stating you believe , without offering explanation for why belief exists , does not make sense . 
2894	898	people guilty of fraud are birther `` experts you follow . 
2895	899	Yeah , ASPECT_OBAMA is guilty of is ASPECT_WAR_CRIME , taking bribes , and violating constitutional rights of Americans via domestic spying . 
2896	899	God , if GONNA 're gonna hate and condemn man , at least hate and condemn GOD for legitimate reasons . 
2897	899	whole problem is there has n't been CHANGE . 
2898	899	change is change in your pocket amounts to your ASPECT_LIFE_SAVING after being robbed by capitalist class while ASPECT_OBAMA was picking ASPECT_REAGAN butt and being taught by ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON how to be black ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON who reagan was democratic ASPECT_RONALD ASPECT_REAGAN . 
2899	899	change would be De-Reaganization . 
2900	901	You clearly do not understand how unemployment rate is determined . 
2901	901	RATE has to do with collecting unemployment benefits or not . 
2902	901	RATE has to do with actively seeking employment vs not seeking employment . 
2903	901	There are people who do want to work , but are not seeking work , who are not in work force , but how do you determine ? 
2904	901	WORK is impossible , so basically you or one , just made up . 
2905	902	Frodly , there are people who believe that unemployment benefits are ASPECT_JOB_CREATOR too . 
2906	902	Do I have to prove what stupid idea is too ? 
2907	902	kinds of ASPECT_GOVT_SPENDING do stimulate economy . 
2908	902	I never said SPENDING could n't . 
2909	902	Dollar for dollar , you ca n't beat DEFENSE spending for ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH . 
2910	902	Another nice about defense spending is that is actually authorized by Constitution . 
2911	902	I have no link to prove that economy would be better off without porkulus bill . 
2912	902	You have no link to prove that economy would be worse . 
2913	902	I do n't see point in butting heads . 
2914	902	POINT bizarre that you say I opinion is unprovable , but yours is `` widely accepted to be true . 
2915	902	You want ASPECT_ECONOMIC_REASONING ? 
2916	902	How about human nature ? 
2917	902	money will have to come from somewhere , frodly . 
2918	902	800,000,000,000 . 
2919	902	We know where MONEY will have to come from . 
2920	902	WE know that budgets get bigger , not smaller . 
2921	902	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH comes from risks . 
2922	902	There 's in porkulus bill encourages risks . 
2923	902	sheer size of bill discourages risk . 
2924	902	SIZE human nature . 
2925	902	Go ahead and ignore SIZE . 
2926	902	Not I . 
2927	903	I have very simple economic reasoning to support I position . 
2928	903	current economic crisis is not supply problem , CRISIS is matter of insufficient demand . 
2929	903	ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING boosts aggregate demand , therefore boosting economy . 
2930	903	Not only , but unemployment insurance undoubtedly stimulates economy . 
2931	903	There is no doubt that INSURANCE also offers work disincentive , but in ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DOWNTURN , that disincentive is pretty irrelevant . 
2932	903	People are not out of work at moment , because PEOPLE get unemployment insurance , and therefore have no reason to look for work . 
2933	903	PEOPLE are out of work , because housing bubble burst , and we had ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DOWNTURN . 
2934	903	Removing or reducing unemployment benefits might cause people to get jobs people are likely overqualified for , but reality is WE would till have millions of people who can not find work !! 
2935	903	What do you do with people ? 
2936	903	If government gives people unemployment benefits , PEOPLE will spend money , thereby stimulating economy . 
2937	903	GOVERNMENT is n't that complicated either . 
2938	903	Unemployed people use income people receive from government , which then increases demand , consumption , etc. . 
2939	903	Which then can create jobs . 
2940	903	While there is strong evidence to suggest it is disincentive to work , DISINCENTIVE also certainly creates jobs for others !! 
2941	905	Just posting info . 
2942	905	I never implied INFO to be gospel or future prediction . 
2943	907	How did it costs jobs and prevent growth . 
2944	907	If money had not been distributed in hundreds of billions in tax cuts and funds for projects and governments , please explain your scenario of how there would be employment and growth . 
2945	908	Are you just digging ? 
2946	908	If you dispute information , show information to be wrong . 
2947	908	You know , offer information . 
2948	908	Like show how bo has spent of almost trillion dollar stimulus and how BO has not spent . 
2949	908	You know , money bo needed right away to stimulate economy and hold unemployment rate to 8 . 
2950	908	Yes to 8 , ASPECT_LOL . 
2951	909	I did n't make claim . 
2952	909	Proof that he has spend almost trillion in stimulus ? 
2953	909	I do n't think PROOF is near . 
2954	910	Man , , if ASPECT_OBAMA is doing impression of sky diver holding boulder than ASPECT_OBAMA is doing one hell of good job ... lolremember folks , is man was given nobel peace prize , and University has OBAMA I believe 13 on folks list of ASPECT_GREAT presidents , 's one above ASPECT_REAGAN I believe ... LOLHow you get to be in position and have well over half country disagreeing with your two largest agendas -LRB- health and immigration -RRB- I have no idea . 
2955	910	Then again we still do not know why ASPECT_OBAMA received nobel peace prize . 
2956	910	Perhaps WE do know but rather not say ... I know is if couple has purple child and becomes purple president than WE know where nobel peace prize will be going ... sure winner \*\* 
2957	911	govt spending money it does n't have is fake demand , frodly . 
2958	911	MONEY 's like middle-class guy going out and getting ASPECT_LAMBORGHINI . 
2959	911	If was true , why did n't tax rebate create jobs ? 
2960	911	Remember everybody got 300-600 ? 
2961	911	ASPECT_MICHELLE_OBAMA said once we bought earrings , ONCE would be gone . 
2962	911	At least money was supposedly going to disposable income . 
2963	911	Unemployment benefits do not . 
2964	911	kind of thinking has got to stop . 
2965	911	jobs are created by ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR . 
2966	911	ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR is not evil . 
2967	911	Make argument day long that unemployment helps people keep people homes , but do n't believe ARGUMENT create jobs . 
2968	911	I 'm out of words . 
2969	911	Stop listening to bozos and think . 
2970	912	But when Govt spends , GOVT creates jobs . 
2971	912	Ask hundreds of thousands that work in military industry . 
2972	913	No you did n't . 
2973	913	You just , typically , questioned info without rebuttal information . 
2974	913	You are right , RIGHT is not that much . 
2975	913	But is why ASPECT_BO said ASPECT_BO needed money right away , RIGHT ? 
2976	913	To get economy stimulated and hold unemployment to 8 , RIGHT ? 
2977	913	Of course economy was . 
2978	913	funny though , after getting ASPECT_BO `` stimulus passed right away , ASPECT_BO is still holding over half of money . 
2979	913	STIMULUS wonder why ? 
2981	913	-LRB- not really -RRB- `` stimulus spending update : 324 billion of Recovery act funds spentwed , 06\/30\/2010 - 15:00 ASPECT_ADMINRECOVERY_NEWSBY_SEBASTIAN_JONESTHE_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION has spent close to 324 billion in ASPECT_STIMULUS_FUND , according to numbers from Recovery . 
2982	913	gov. latest includes 205 billion in spending and 119 billion in ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
2983	913	Overall , just over 40 percent of about 800 billion ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGE has entered economy . 
2984	913	You can track ASPECT_STIMULUS_SPENDING by agency on interactive stimulus progress bar .

2990	914	I thought you were way off . 
2991	917	Well we somehow could afford 10.6 trillion in debt run up by ASPECT_REPUBLICAN policies prior to ASPECT_OBAMA taking office . 
2992	917	So I think WE can afford fraction more of . 
2993	917	But I certainly agree , ASPECT_OBAMA needs to raised taxes and trim spending to get deficits down . 
2994	918	little off topic but who knows basic physics should get kick out of analogy . 
2995	919	You skipped over of my posts . 
2996	920	I was only addressing your point . 
2997	920	But I comments on your second point are two :1 -RRB- You do n't know that ASPECT_TAX_CUT did not create jobs . 
2998	920	They may have created lots of jobs , :1 just that of jobs being lost from recession was greater until recently .2 -RRB- ASPECT_TAX_CUT wo n't create jobs in near term if who receive ASPECT_TAX_CUT do n't spend money and instead save MONEY or use money to pay down debt , as was happening in recession . 
2999	920	's why ASPECT_TAX_CUT are not panacea and do n't work as well as direct spending for creating jobs in recession .

3108	940	You really do not post much more than baiting questions . 
3109	940	Facts are facts . 
3110	940	You do not seem to have them .

3119	941	I probably can post 50 . 
3120	941	Just from `` states posting surpluses thread alone .

3123	941	Facts are facts . 
3124	941	You do not seem to have them .

3127	941	Even you can not dispute . 
3129	941	But I hope your handlers still pay you . 
3130	941	HANDLERS must find value -LRB- entertainment -rrb- in your nonsense . 
3131	941	As we have seen , here do not . 
3132	941	You do n't have to post 50 examples of I posts were asked I to back up factual assertions I made and I did n't do 50 . 
3133	941	Just shoot for , say , 3 . 
3134	941	Just to show everyone on board that your posts are n't simply baiting . 
3135	942	sigh ... http : \ \/ \ \/ www.bls.gov\/cps\/cps_htgm.htm #conceptsI really get tried of doing people basic research for PEOPLE . 
3136	943	link is BS . 
3137	943	time I 've been asked questions -LRB- in link -RRB- is while I 'm receiving unemployment compensation . 
3139	943	Once unemployment compensation ends , I 'm considered out of work force . 
3141	943	End of valid argument . 
3142	946	So you would love one party rule too ?? 
3143	948	poll of voters released today . 
3144	948	question , In -LRB- 2012 -RRB- ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_ELECTION , would you vote for ASPECT_OBAMA or `` Republican . 
3145	948	Not republican or that ASPECT_REPUBLICAN , just `` Republican . 
3146	948	`` result ? 
3147	948	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN 42 obama 37 obummer , can not even beat ` generic ' republican . 
3148	948	YOU 'd bet if OBUMMER was against , `` Another democrat ? 
3149	948	obummer would lose one too . 
3150	948	Had they asked , `` Independent ? 
3151	948	`` obummer would have gotten blown off board . 
3152	950	And kicker is right now , tide is favoring gop retaking at least ASPECT_HOUSE in November , and not just so-called `` establishment rino republicans , but far more ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE republicans to boot ! 
3153	951	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.politifact.com \ \/ truth-o-meter\/promises \ \/ websites show how MAN is doing and what man has managed . 
3154	951	Look at man website , or website I previously posted , or library of ASPECT_CONGRESS website . 
3155	951	is and always has been democratic policy . 
3156	951	Again , always has been democratic policy , saying man bad man for following man party policy . 
3157	951	Before MAN was elected , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH increased debt to 10.3 trillion , today trillion is 13 trillion ... far less increase . 
3158	951	way can be sure of , is come November 2012 , otherwise must assume that MAN is working with backing of majority of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE . 
3159	951	By allowing ASPECT_ARIZONA to pass stricter ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_LAW ? 
3160	951	Again , debatable , if you can name , I 'd be happy to debate with you . 
3161	951	MAN actually has better foreign diplomacy than previous president , strengthening claim in un and nato and shifted war to homeland of true enemy , rather than deceiving into continuing war previously though over . 
3162	951	Again , check above website . 
3163	952	They get THEY news from Faux news , where everything is coming up roses for right-wing - no as reality for THEY . 
3164	952	they insensitivity to others is amazing - and I hope Dems are able to capitalize on how Republicans always seem to be on side of wealthy , corporations and how little WEALTHY care about Americans . 
3165	952	THEY do n't want to extend unemployment benefits to are hurting and accusing THEY of not looking for jobs , is just heartless . 
3166	952	eye-opener for everyone . 
3167	953	I do n't like how Republicans have been acting - they do n't deserve to be given control . 
3168	954	Was poll done by Faux news ? 
3169	956	He has not been transparent . 
3170	956	Only when pressured to do so . 
3171	956	is why they need to be booted out of office . 
3172	956	Just wait : http : \ \/ \ \/ blog.heritage.org \ \/ 2010\/02\/05 \ \/ ... s-in-pictures \ \/ hcr was shoved thru with majority of Americans opposing Obamacare . 
3173	956	Even now , majority of Americans want NOW repealed . 
3174	956	ASPECT_OBAMACARE did n't allow . 
3175	956	ASPECT_OBAMACARE is suing to block ASPECT_ARIZONA law . 
3176	956	ASPECT_JANET ASPECT_NAPOLITANO , ASPECT_OBAMA dohs secretary , has weakened ASPECT_BORDER_SECURITY . 
3178	956	Cap & trade . 
3180	956	Oh yeah , ASPECT_HCR is making friends over world . 
3181	956	You have n't been paying attention . 
3182	956	Quit watching ASPECT_MSLSD . 
3183	958	You do realize site you just called BS is site for ASPECT_BUREAU ASPECT_OF ASPECT_LABOR ASPECT_STATISTICS right ? 
3184	958	In otherwords you just said ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AGENCY responsible for counting unemployment rates is wrong about how unemployment rates are counted . 
3185	958	Do you enjoy being laughably wrong ? 
3186	959	NO , it was NOT FOX ASPECT_NEWS_POLL . 
3187	959	ASPECT_FOX ASPECT_NEWS , that you mindless liberals love to call Faux news , is burying what used to be main stream media . 
3188	959	ASPECT_FOX continues to rise in ratings -LRB- even before bo -rrb- while ASPECT_NBC , ASPECT_CNN , ASPECT_ABC , and ASPECT_CBS plummet . 
3189	959	ASPECT_FOX is now premier ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE of ASPECT_USA . 
3190	959	You might want to watch and find out what is REALLY going on . 
3191	959	ASPECT_FOX presents news , not news they like or dislike , NEWS . 
3192	959	old , tired , failing , networks are now but advertising agencies for liberal left . 
3193	959	THEY no longer KNOW what news is , and THEY ca n't figure out why they are failing across board . 
3194	959	watch fox and you 'll be shocked to find bill o'rielly is as strong ASPECT_OBAMA_DEFENDER as in old media . 
3195	959	From beginning of bho reign , ASPECT_O'RIELLY has constantly said , `` Wait and see . 
3196	959	`` Give ASPECT_FOX chance . 
3197	959	`` ASPECT_OBAMA is very smart man . 
3198	959	`` On hand , ASPECT_GLENN_BECK thinks and says BHO is horror . 
3199	959	is presenting 2 sides of story . 
3200	959	Throughout broadcast day ASPECT_FOX has on STAUNCH Democrats and near and far left liberals . 
3201	959	FAR give FAR pulpit and let FAR present FAR ideology . 
3202	959	lamestream media USED to do , now FAR do n't . 
3203	959	On ASPECT_GLENN_BECK , , , , , No one in administration , or on left has PROVED anything that ASPECT_BECK says to be lie . 
3204	959	And ASPECT_BECK challenges FAR to do so regularly . 
3205	959	left claims beck lying , but not once have FAR been able to say , `` Here is fact proving ASPECT_BECK was lying . 
3206	959	beck proves administration is lying on almost daily basis . 
3207	959	ASPECT_FOX presents BOTH sides , rest present liberal view ONLY . 
3208	959	ASPECT_FOX prospers , rest slowly sink . 
3209	959	Keep calling them Faux news , THEM are laughing at your foolishly closed mind . 
3210	960	support your opinion please sir . 
3212	961	Even though websites are run by his personal staff or were set up before HIS even took office . 
3213	961	Also , how could there be so criticism of ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA if ASPECT_OBAMA was n't transparent . 
3214	961	because they disagree with your budgetary policies ? 
3215	961	Besides fact that you 're quoting opinion blog , you should really read article . 
3216	961	FACT says ASPECT_OBAMA_PROGRAM would push us 2.5 trillion dollars deeper into debt by 2020 . 
3217	961	In 8 years ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH dropped ASPECT_US 10.3 trillion into debt . 
3218	961	Again , not comparison . 
3219	961	ASPECT_HCR was passed through according to what 8 promised at beginning of 8 campaign . 
3220	961	You 're claiming 8 's bad person for sticking to 8 promises . 
3221	961	If 8 really wanted to block beginning 8 could 've issued presidential executive order . 
3222	961	One speech , law out . 
3223	961	ASPECT_HCR followed 'S promises made during campaign . 
3224	961	Cap and trade is designed to get us off foreign oil dependency . 
3225	961	I thought thats what majority of people wanted 'S never actually pardoned anybody . 
3226	961	threatened too , but never did . 
3227	961	ASPECT_YAH , ASPECT_YAH is = -RRB- haha you have trouble distinguishing independent from democrat . 
3228	961	I watch ASPECT_FOX news , I also watch ASPECT_CNN , and do internet research . 
3229	962	Just read posts on forum . 
3230	963	He has not been transparent . 
3231	963	is why HE gets criticism . 
3232	963	Dems want to spend , spend , spend and tax , tax , tax . 
3233	963	I disagree with . 
3234	963	ASPECT_HCR was not passed , DEMS was shoved through . 
3235	963	majority of folks opposed ASPECT_DEMS . 
3236	963	Link : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.rasmussenreports.com \ \/ publ ... th_care_reform He would get too heat for . 
3237	963	is why HTTP : \ \/ \ \/ WWW.RASMUSSENREPORTS.COM \ \/ PUBL ... TH_CARE_REFORM is going through courts . 
3238	963	Obamacare is opposed by majority of ASPECT_AMERICANS . 
3239	963	Cap & trade will not reduce dependency . 
3240	963	It is another tax will hurt companies , consumers , and economy . 
3241	963	OBAMACARE is still not finished with trying to push through amnesty for illegals . 
3242	963	What joke . 
3243	963	Then you had better start digesting information because you are coming to false conclusions . 
3244	964	And 's exactly why you know how ASPECT_HCR was `` pushed through and about new cap and trade bill and about Immigration . 
3245	964	Because government is n't transparent ? 
3246	964	And 's your right , do n't discredit man by calling man unamerican because you disagree with MAN . 
3247	964	RIGHT will dwarf RIGHT ? 
3248	964	Your blaming ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA for that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH started . 
3249	964	And as you 've seen , by your website , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA spending plan will greatly minimize rate of increase of debt : step to decreasing website . 
3250	964	I can not deny , that by your website , Americans are against WEBSITE . 
3251	964	Please explain how ASPECT_HCR is pushed through when everybody but President dislikes DISLIKES . 
3252	964	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.sightline.org \ \/ research\/en ... FRpTgwodfnN3gg DISLIKES not tax . 
3253	964	HTTP : \ \/ \ \/ WWW.SIGHTLINE.ORG \ \/ RESEARCH\/EN ... FRPTGWODFNN3GG government implanted business regulation . 
3254	964	hmmm and yet hmmm not in headlines ... false conclusion I have trust in President ? 
3255	964	And actually back PRESIDENT ? 
3256	965	I find out how crap is on table , and how bad crap is through outlets I watch\/listen to - not obama or congress . 
3257	965	goal is to keep us in dark and pass destructive legislation with midnight\/weekend votes . 
3258	965	ASPECT_OBAMA is un-American because ASPECT_OBAMA is systematically destroying ASPECT_US constitution and us liberties . 
3259	965	Yes , ASPECT_OBAMA will dwarf ASPECT_BUSH contributions to us deficit . 
3260	965	will be ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL . 
3261	965	Democrats have no backbone , except ones voted against BACKBONE . 
3262	965	ONES accepted back-door deals from ASPECT_OBAMA , or were otherwise pressured into voting for BACKBONE . 
3263	965	ONES were sacrificed for sake of Obamacare . 
3264	965	Businesses have to pay additional if ONES exceed ones credits , are essentially paying energy tax . 
3265	965	ONES will recoup ones money by passing additional costs to consumer . 
3266	965	price of products and services will go up . 
3267	965	ASPECT_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION will not decrease . 
3268	965	Cap and trade : will cap ASPECT_SAVE ASPECT_EARTH ? 
3269	965	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.youtube.com \ \/ watch ? 
3269	965	v = lppvdopfcia cap will be if ASPECT_MSM covers ASPECT_MSM . 
3270	965	Hopefully , you will see light . 
3271	966	And where do your outlets get it from ? 
3272	966	Oh right , ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
3273	966	How are they to be transparent , you want THEY to walk up to person door and explain point of THEY policy ? 
3274	966	very criticizes THEY , THEY must depend on for being transparent . 
3275	966	So far you have no proof to . 
3276	966	He has offered no change to Constitution and has n't removed single liberty . 
3277	966	website YOU posted already disproved fact . 
3278	966	So HE convinced spineless democrats to vote for Obamacare . 
3279	966	Yet there were voted against ASPECT_OBAMACARE . 
3280	966	With need for majority to pass Obamacare , and republican controlled congress , how exactly was forced through , with full weight of against and as well ? 
3281	966	Then FAULT is not President fault . 
3282	966	PRESIDENT has performed measure would be effective for decreasing ASPECT_ENERGY_CONSUMPTION and also gain government income . 
3283	966	FAULT is companies ' fault for not following set limit . 
3284	966	... what ? 
3285	966	Are you really trying to counter argue with simply saying ASPECT_NEWS_MEDIUM will report news ? 
3286	966	just simply made my head hurt ... MY have , HURT quite dark , ASPECT_AFRICAN ASPECT_AMERICAN in fact ! 
3287	969	It is long because IT has to be . 
3288	969	We see how Constitution and bill of Rights are extensively malleable and dependent on perception . 
3289	969	If bill passes now-a-days , BILL must be watertight to avoid flexibility , and makes bill long . 
3290	969	As for loopholes , in bill , there are compromises . 
3291	969	With bill as controversial as one and enacted right after very tense and violent campaign , Congressmen are likely to compromise over bill . 
3292	969	Also CONGRESSMEN add unneeded amendments and money spending called pork barrel . 
3293	969	is done mainly by who are against bill in hopes of getting voted down . 
3294	969	You are generally insulting government , simply because government opposition put up fight . 
3295	970	Did you know that if you went to library of ASPECT_CONGRESS you can read single bill is currently being voted on ? 
3296	970	Also you can analyze who put LIBRARY up for vote , where LIBRARY is in voting process , how nays and ayes there are currently for CURRENTLY , who wrote CURRENTLY and which party they are , when CURRENTLY was introduced , which companies\/people are backing bill , which committee bill is under , who heads that committee , what that persons political stance on bill is , how much bill will cost , who will be paying for COMMITTEE , and approximately how CURRENTLY will be till CURRENTLY takes effect . 
3297	970	Just because ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA does n't force ASPECT_CONGRESS to give daily televised speech on thousands of bills that pass through CONGRESS , does n't mean that CONGRESS is not becoming more transparent . 
3298	971	ASPECT_BARACK once promised that non-emergency bill to come before ASPECT_BARACK would be posted on WH site for 5 days before ASPECT_BARACK signed SITE . 
3299	971	took barack about one week to break promise . 
3300	971	BARACK broken about numerous times since . 
3301	971	For matter , has BARACK ever put even one bill on WH website 5 days before signing MATTER ? 
3302	971	Kinda funny watching video NOW . 
3303	971	I do n't think KINDA big deal that ASPECT_BARACK does n't post bills for public input . 
3304	971	BARACK does n't give crap what people say anyway . 
3305	972	Kinda funny that people believed he would have time to and that people find TIME prudent to look on executive branch website for legislative matter . 
3306	973	So you knew he was lying ? 
3307	973	Have you ever looked ? 
3308	973	HE does post bills there . 
3309	973	Just not for 5 days . 
3310	974	No , I did n't , but NO like getting great dinner and complaining you did n't get desert . 
3311	974	Good for him ! 
3312	974	I 'm glad him does , just wondering why people truly expect executive website to be solely responsible for reports on legislative matters . 
3313	975	From inauguration , ASPECT_BO had control of both house and ASPECT_SENATE . 
3314	975	Democrats could pass bill they wished in totally partisan manner . 
3315	975	Republicans could grumble , but were powerless to stop or even delay , legislation from ASPECT_DAY_ONE . 
3316	975	Yet DAY took BO over year to pass bo signature health care bill . 
3317	975	And to pass DAY , of DEMOCRATS had to be bribed and coerced and promised who knows what as group of them SUDDENLY decided to vote for hcr and retire . 
3318	975	net result is bill only messes up ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM and will likely forever change health care insurance , and not for better . 
3319	975	is not good government . 
3320	975	PEOPLE said PEOPLE did NOT want that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL . 
3321	975	And now People say PEOPLE want bill repealed and bi-partisan bill worked out . 
3322	975	ASPECT_BO refused to listen , then and now ! 
3323	975	people WILL speak in November and bo will be forced to listen as ASPECT_BO becomes essentially lame duck halfway through bo term . 
3324	976	Republicans have just as much right in ASPECT_CONGRESS to fillibuster , pork barrel , amend , and debate hell out of bill , which is probably what happened to bill . 
3325	976	As for bribery and ridiculous claims , has had charges brought against them ? 
3326	976	been sued ? 
3327	976	confronted with evidence ? 
3328	976	Or are innocuous claims thrown out into public for benefit of great and benevolent leader ? 
3329	977	Try . 
3330	977	YES voted for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA . 
3331	977	On one hand ASPECT_OBAMA is too liberal for YES , and on too conservative . 
3332	977	ASPECT_OBAMA is too conservative because ASPECT_OBAMA let ASPECT_WALL_STREET walk over ASPECT_OBAMA , when YES was expecting ASPECT_OBAMA to kick corporate ass . 
3333	977	ASPECT_OBAMA is too liberal for YES because ASPECT_OBAMA sent Attorney general to ASPECT_ARIZONA to sue and stop ASPECT_ARIZONA immigration law . 
3334	977	border is out of control , and ASPECT_OBAMA should be trying to work with governor jan brewer to clean up criminal illegal alien and anchor baby mess . 
3335	977	ASPECT_OBAMA did get ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE passed which was major issue for YES . 
3336	977	Will YES vote for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA again ? 
3337	977	YES answered `` yes , because YES believe Obama\/Biden will see light with help of ASPECT_AMERICAN labor when OBAMA\/BIDEN comes to issue of illegals . 
3338	977	If ASPECT_OBAMA does not , YES may shop around . 
3339	977	Under no circumstances will YES vote for ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN for ASPECT_POLITICAL_OFFICE . 
3340	977	She is simply incompetent . 
3341	977	YES know are talking of not voting at . 
3342	977	YES used to think was wrong . 
3343	978	They were supposed to televise hcr debates on ASPECT_C-SPAN and post bills with sufficient time for ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE to see THEY . 
3344	978	THEY did not do . 
3345	978	THEY finally started to post items , but with days til voting . 
3346	978	Not enough time . 
3347	978	VOTING 's work in progress . 
3348	978	ASPECT_HCR is one example . 
3349	978	He has appointed two judges to Supreme court who can not uphold Constitution , and will legislate from bench . 
3350	978	You 're misreading TWO apparently then . 
3351	978	Quit looking at TWO upside down . 
3352	978	You apparently did n't watch video . 
3353	978	You lost me on one . 
3354	979	that executive branch can do is open court doors to media , they can not force THEY to come and people to watch . 
3355	979	In fact much of time FACT WAS televised on C-Span but THEY promised live coverage and votes were being done at unreasonable hours . 
3356	979	I believe he promised \ \/ in 5 days , aka days . 
3357	979	And you 're saying it is n't THEY right to do so ? 
3358	979	I 'm confused , you seem to believe that President has enormous legislative power , and yet ASPECT_JUDICIAL_BRANCH has none . 
3359	979	I did more than look at graph , I read referenced article and hmm : -LRB- Raise -RRB- publicly held ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT to over 18 trillion . 
3360	979	GRAPH was at 10.3 trillion dollars when handed over to PRESIDENT ... seems that president clocks in at 8 trillion , significantly less than warmongering previous leader . 
3361	979	As of 2010 you 're quite right . 
3362	979	But what of president two years ? 
3363	979	You are quite right , I did not . 
3364	979	I refuse to let let debate for them . 
3365	979	If you wish to quote video and reference video , fine . 
3366	979	I was arguing that President had given up on president attempts , and backed VIDEO up by saying it was so high profile VIDEO would still be in news if PRESIDENT were still trying . 
3367	979	And you said yes YES would be if ASPECT_MSM covered YES ... ? 
3369	980	ASPECT_OBAMA was less than sincere on ASPECT_OBAMA_PROMISE to be transparent . 
3370	980	ASPECT_OBAMA apparently has lot of influence on ASPECT_OBAMA_HERD of sheep in ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
3371	980	SCOTUS is supposed to interpret law and abide by Constitution . 
3372	980	They can not legislate nor re-write Constitution in ASPECT_THEY_ACTION . 
3373	980	Where do you come up with 10.3 trillion for ASPECT_BUSH ?

3378	980	html He is still pushing for Cap & trade . 
3379	980	ARTICLE just has another name nowadays : ASPECT_AMERICAN power act . 
3380	981	And yet he 's fulfilled it . 
3381	981	ruling of ASPECT_SUPREME ASPECT_COURT has weight as written constitution , and under activist judges , Supreme court has seen fit to interpret laws in quite liberal fashion . 
3382	981	interpretations include roe wade with creation of law that women has right to control her body , and gibbons ogden and widening of meaning of `` interstate commerce to mean pretty much anything passed between states , including people . 
3383	981	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.cbsnews.com \ \/ 8301-500803 1...28-500803 . 
3383	981	html `` in fact wade was just two months ago , on July 30 , that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH signed housing and economic recovery act , which contained provision raising debt ceiling to 10.615 trillion `` Sorry , ROE underestimated . 
3384	981	website also shows that bailout was legislation started and pushed through by ASPECT_BUSH , not ASPECT_OBAMA_ACTUALLY in 2007 - 09 years , there was equal senate with two libertarians , effectively ASPECT_REPUBLICAN controlled ASPECT_SENATE . 
3385	981	Mind you was year that ASPECT_HCR passed . 
3386	981	So let ASPECT_ROE get straight . 
3387	981	Cap and trade is limit put on companies and if companies exceed limits have to pay fee . 
3388	981	CAP is not tax . 
3389	981	Too bad we were n't talking about . 
3390	983	ASPECT_OBAMA will not go down in history as worst president in history , I am pretty sure ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_JR. will beat ASPECT_OBAMA by landslide on one . 
3391	984	they both have to beat franklin piercejimmy carterjames buchananherbert hooverwe wont truly know impact of ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY for years . 
3392	985	Not technically tax . 
3393	985	WE will pay fine for over use of carbon . 
3394	985	extra cost will be reflected in higher prices we , including poorest among us , will get to pay . 
3395	985	And there is no possible argument that increased cost will not be passed on to consumers -LRB- ASPECT_US ! -RRB- 
3396	985	ORCompanies will go to energy exchange company , like ASPECT_CCX , and trade carbon credits after ORCOMPANIES have exceeded orcompanies cap . 
3397	985	CCX stands to make Billions off CAP & trade law . 
3398	985	And big surprise , who was very involved in financing and establishment of CCX ? 
3399	985	And sharing in BILLIONS will be ASPECT_PRIVATE_CITIZEN helped establish CCX . 
3400	985	CITIZEN name is b. h. ASPECT_OBAMA . 
3401	986	Far from it . 
3402	986	You 're delusional on one . 
3403	986	They are supposed to interpret Constitution and rule by CONSTITUTION , not change ASPECT_CONSTITUTION . 
3404	986	ASPECT_BUSH certainly had BUSH spending problems , no doubt , but ASPECT_OBAMA is going to town on spending - ASPECT_VEGAS style . 
3405	986	ASPECT_SENATE was not controlled by Republicans . 
3406	986	House was controlled by Dems . 
3407	986	ASPECT_HOUSE essentially passed bill with house democratic majority . 
3408	986	ASPECT_SENATE just had to vote on reconciliatory package , where they only needed 51 votes . 
3409	986	Call SENATE what you want . 
3410	986	SENATE tax , and ASPECT_SENATE will hit us as THEY pass extra costs to consumer . 
3411	986	SENATE . 
3412	987	I suppose your suggestion is ASPECT_PALIN ? 
3413	987	BwahahaAnd you think ONES are ones need ASPECT_MENTAL_TREATMENT . 
3414	988	poll week pitted BO against ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
3415	988	BO lost by 5 ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_POINT to Republican .

ASPECT_BUSH earns place in bottom five , according to ASPECT_SIENA ASPECT_COLLEGE ASPECT_RESEARCH ASPECT_INSTITUTE recent survey of 238 presidential scholars released Thursday . 
3430	990	-LRB- See slide show of 10 Worst presidents . -RRB- 
3431	991	Was that Faux ASPECT_NEWS_POLL or at one of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY ? 
3433	991	answer you liberals seem to be able to conjure up and ANSWER is incorrect . 
3434	991	Not fax news poll or tea party poll . 
3435	991	independent poll . 
3436	991	ASPECT_MJ_KIM liberal left wing writer . 
3437	991	Her opinion is supposed to mean ? 
3438	991	Not to rational . 
3439	992	YES said `` yes . 
3440	992	Because you see right can not think for RIGHT . 
3441	992	Whatever ASPECT_FOX talking points are for day , you push DAY in here . 
3442	992	YES voted for ASPECT_OBAMA because YES wanted ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM , and YES am very happy . 
3443	992	ASPECT_OBAMA is down in polls because of unemployment . 
3444	992	Unless Republicans can come up with million jobs before November election , Democrats will stay in charge . 
3445	992	YES God your party does not even have leader ! 
3446	992	People are running around yelling ` neocon , ' ` Libertarian , ' or ` ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER ! ' 
3447	992	Republicans are mess and on brink of shutting down . 
3448	992	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN indeed ! 
3449	992	See , YES can make up YES mind for YES . 
3450	992	YES differ from main stream of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY and support ASPECT_ARIZONA immigration law . 
3451	992	Myself and Dems do not want to get too close because idiot ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER who have covered issue with racist stink , which we will not tolerate . 
3452	992	And , fact that your point man , sheriff ASPECT_JOE ASPECT_ARPAIO of ASPECT_MARICOPA ASPECT_COUNTY , -LRB- ASPECT_PHOENIX -RRB- , treats arpaio prisoners with `` cruel and unusual punishment , and is thoroughly corrupt , does not offer left confidence WE are looking for . 
3453	992	ASPECT_UNLESS ASPECT_ARIZONA gets ASPECT_ARIZONA immigration law out of bungler joe arpio hands and under control of governor jan brewer , whole will go down toilet . 
3454	992	If happens Dems will pick up seats in ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
3455	992	Another republican disgrace like ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_MCCAIN or ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH . 
3456	992	Now , where did historicus leave off ? 
3457	992	Oh , yes needs ASPECT_MENTAL_TREATMENT . 
3458	992	YES think you are correct . 
3459	992	Start with ASPECT_RNC . 
3460	993	i did get 2 and 3 though . 
3462	993	I completely forgot about hardings corrupt admin . 
3463	994	I ca n't quote your statements since you posted it kinda weird but I 'll do I best . 
3464	994	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH was also notorious for keeping ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR off books , which kept numbers lower . 
3465	994	And yes I can , ASPECT_BUSH increased NOTORIOUS 71.9 over four years , report was only on ASPECT_BUSH second term , considering we actually had surplus after ASPECT_CLINTON . 
3466	994	ASPECT_OBAMA has increased NOTORIOUS little under 40 in two years , so little over ASPECT_BUSH , I mistake . 
3467	994	As for second : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.infoplease.com\/ipa\/A0774721.html And higher prices will drive consumers , hopefully , to companies who can stay under consumers limit . 
3468	994	Therefore responsible companies will rise to top . 
3469	994	Oh please , Presidents use presidents position to gain money time for presidents constituents , like politician . 
3470	994	What about ASPECT_BUSH hiring ASPECT_CHENEY company to fight war in ASPECT_IRAQ ? 
3471	995	Well that debate was effectively ended . 
3472	995	By interpreting Constitution , they essentially change constitution . 
3473	995	THEY can change meanings of laws . 
3474	995	CONSTITUTION called activist court . 
3475	995	And yet of debt currently attributed to ASPECT_OBAMA , came from ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGE . 
3476	995	`` By 2020 , annual deficit as percentage of GDP will be 5.6 , according to ASPECT_CBO . 
3477	995	ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE estimates HOUSE will be 4.2 . 
3478	995	`` If you read farther into article YOU would notice that ARTICLE shows when ASPECT_OBAMA was confronted with projections YOU mentioned OBAMA : `` has created fiscal advisory commission to recommend ways lawmakers can get annual deficits down to 3 of GDP by 2015 . 
3479	995	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.infoplease.com\/ipa\/A0774721.html Okay how bill works is , both chambers vote on identical versions of bill , YOU make YOU amendments and changes and then YOU switch , and chamber changes version . 
3480	995	If , at end , two versions are n't , YOU get called into conference where unanimous vote is needed to get VOTE passed . 
3481	995	Also , majority vote is needed to make changes . 
3482	995	So while Dems may have had control in ASPECT_HOUSE , YOU would need control in ASPECT_SENATE to `` push bill through without good amount of help from Repubs . 
3483	995	Not to mention fact that , as you claimed , Dems voted against FEE . 
3484	995	FEE 's not tax . 
3485	995	FEE fee under circumstances . 
3486	995	tax is forced , fee is optional . 
3487	995	Yes , Cap and Trade is exactly as amnesty for Immigrants . 
3488	996	Yes , with conclusion that ASPECT_OBAMA has n't been very transparent . 
3489	996	ASPECT_OBAMA is only being forced to be more transparent now from pressure to do so , but ASPECT_OBAMA certainly was n't in 18 months of ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY . 
3490	996	Interpreting Constitution does NOT imply changing Constitution . 
3491	996	SCOTUS is NOT supposed to be activist . 
3492	996	They are ASPECT_JUDICIAL_BRANCH , not ASPECT_LEGISLATIVE_BRANCH . 
3493	996	You are talking about `` annual deficit numbers . 
3494	996	`` ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is still projected to be 90 of GDP by 2020 . 
3495	996	111th congress voted on ASPECT_HCR . 
3496	996	There were 57 ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC senators . 
3497	996	SENATORS needed was 51 votes for reconciliation . 
3498	996	If SENATORS exceed senators caps , SENATORS will be subject to fees , which are mandatory at point , not optional . 
3499	996	It is essentially tax on over-production will be passed on to consumer via goods and services . 
3500	996	Apparently , we were not on page with one . 
3501	997	And what did health insurance debacle actually do for you ? 
3502	997	What debacle did for me is cut medicare spending on dialysis . 
3503	997	thanks obamination , peeelooosiii and dickwart reid . 
3504	997	Has seen list of which traitors cheered that mexican dirt bag chastised us in ASPECT_US house ? 
3505	997	ME think LIST important to know exactly who is treasonous pos . 
3506	997	Besides obama . 
3507	998	From article : ASPECT_CBO cited two big contributors to jump in debt . 
3508	998	One is president proposal to extend 2001 and 2003 ASPECT_TAX_CUT for majority of ASPECT_AMERICANS . 
3509	998	is proposal to protect middle - and upper-middle-income families from having to pay Alternative minimum tax -LRB- amt -rrb- . 
3510	998	Together proposals would cost 3 trillion between 2011 and 2020 . 
3511	998	biggest causes for projected increase in deficits are maintaining ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
3512	998	In spite of his promise , ASPECT_OBAMA should follow ASPECT_CLINTON proposal and just repeal ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT in families entirety . 
3513	998	Or HIS has to compensate for keeping portion of FAMILIES with higher taxes on wealthy . 
3514	1000	VETERAN am veteran and while VETERAN am grateful for va healthcare system if is preview of ASPECT_SOCIALIZED_MEDICINE we are gonna die sick . 
3515	1000	VETERAN have been waiting over year on revision of VETERAN replacement . 
3516	1000	To VETERAN horror horror has become infected which means if VETERAN do not lose VETERAN leg horror will highly complicate procedure as well as make horror expensive -LRB- nearly three times what three would have cost if VETERAN would of had op in timely fashion -rrb- . 
3517	1000	At least va not mandatory forcing veteran so called free man in so called free country to buy insurance for sub par medical procedures if and when VETERAN get INFECTED . 
3518	1000	What atrocity ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL is ! 
3519	1000	Not just idea of socialization medicine but draconian way totalitarian powers that be forced IDEA on disproving nation . 
3522	1001	.2 was n't ASPECT_MJ_KIM opinion , but 238 presidential scholars .2 . 
3523	1001	You did n't show proof that ASPECT_MJ_KIM was liberal writer .3 . 
3524	1001	Since she did n't make up list , but just reported on LIST , does LIST really matter ? 
3526	1001	SHE opinion matters to of rational minds - ergo , your comments . 
3527	1002	scholars = liberals . 
3528	1002	Which is exactly why ASPECT_BO is \*\*\* ing up so much . 
3529	1002	BO has no practical experience at anything but elections . 
3530	1002	So BO must refer to books to find ideas . 
3531	1002	If ASPECT_BO calls in `` expert , EXPERIENCE is academic . 
3532	1002	Equally lacking in anything but book knowledge . 
3533	1002	Leadership is not in book . 
3534	1002	So BO is lost in job is way over ASPECT_BO head . 
3535	1002	bo forte , elections , is why in troubled time , BO just keeps on making ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_SPEECH , trying to get elected to job bo already has and can not handle . 
3536	1002	Did you take note of poll results ? 
3537	1002	65 against ASPECT_BO . 
3538	1002	is reflective of ASPECT_USA , not just poll . 
3539	1002	dummy must be voted out . 
3540	1003	ASPECT_TAX_RELIEF for Americans is good in times of economic hardship , not ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE . 
3541	1003	Do n't worry , you 'll be able to pay in taxes soon , starting 1\/1\/2011 . 
3542	1006	If only you could vote twice too eh ? 
3543	1007	He 's Dem . 
3544	1007	HE probably did !! 
3545	1008	republican\/conservative rhetoric not substantiated with facts other than BS being spewed on Faux news , repeated by parrot sheeple . 
3546	1008	ASPECT_OBAMA has knowledge than ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_CHANEY and ASPECT_MCCAIN put together and cons ca n't stand fact that we now have President can actually make cohesive sentence and pronounce words accurately . 
3547	1008	Keep fooling yourself , and when November comes around you can continue saying `` wait till time ! 
3549	1009	Liberals continue nonsense of living in past and comparing obummer with ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_CHENEY , or whomever . 
3550	1009	Conservative independents as HE am compare obummer to reality . 
3551	1009	And reality is that he can orate well , stop . 
3552	1009	But 's REALITY . 
3553	1009	Other than being capable of reading teleprompter extremely well , he brings no skills to job . 
3554	1009	If your vision was not obscured by ideology , you would be able to see . 
3555	1009	In 1.5 years 1.5 has passed by parliamentary trick ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL COUNTRY does not want and Financial reform was also NOT wanted AND NOT NEEDED . 
3556	1009	And ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL did not work . 
3557	1009	1.5 has made ASPECT_US non-leader internationally and world-wide joke . 
3558	1009	1.5 has committed protocol ASPECT_GAFF in and meeting with foreign official . 
3559	1009	In bp disaster , 1.5 took over 60 days to START to get involved . 
3560	1009	Other than using spill to forge document and defraud ASPECT_CONGRESS and ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE by 1.5 drilling moratorium which was not recommended by experts that obummer and interior sec . 
3561	1009	said PEOPLE did . 
3562	1009	Both should be indited for lying to ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
3563	1009	On immigration , 1.5 ignores cities VIOLATING federal law , AND SUES STATE OF ASPECT_AZ . 
3564	1009	is attempting to assist Feds , as federal law suggests . 
3565	1009	And 1.5 now has unemployment benefits up to 123 weeks with no way to pay bill . 
3566	1009	1.5 and conservative independents could fill enough pages to rival liberal Congressional bill just listing errors of commission and omission by obviously incompetent clown . 
3567	1011	Nationally , Liberals are down to 20 . 
3568	1011	conservatives and relatively conservative independents make up rest of country . 
3569	1011	In less than year , country SAW what liberal political control was and we did n't like YEAR at . 
3570	1011	YEAR is too expensive and does n't work . 
3571	1011	Liberalism sounds wonderful , but IS completely impractical . 
3572	1011	And YEAR been exposed by dummy in ASPECT_WH . 
3573	1012	True ... numbers I saw were 21 libs , 40 conservatives , and 35 mixture of right and left leaning independants . 
3574	1012	But is n't MIXTURE going little far for you to assume you can speak for 80 of Americans by saying `` WE do n't like liberal control ? 
3575	1012	How can you know that moderates come down on side of conservatism ? 
3576	1012	I could n't find polls talked about how liberals , moderates , or conservatives thought liberal control is bad . 
3577	1013	polls showing 50 + and up dissatisfaction are n't convincing enough for you ? 
3578	1013	When poll is finished , then you 'll know , poll called nov. election . 
3579	1015	Shpraralain , Very well put . 
3580	1015	If was to happen I would vote for SHPRARALAIN . 
3581	1017	ASPECT_REAGAN polls at point in reagan presidency were or worse . 
3582	1017	So what is your point ? 
3583	1018	HERE 've already been here , ASPECT_IRIE . 
3584	1018	If ASPECT_BARACK does things that ASPECT_REAGAN did , I hope BARACK wins in landslide . 
3585	1019	We have already been there , like about 99 &#37; of what is written in forum . 
3586	1019	People keep saying . 
3587	1019	What does have to do with fact that both are polling about at point in BOTH presidencies ? 
3589	1020	Because they are 2 different people and will do completely different things , why is ASPECT_REAGAN rating at time relevant to Barack rating ? 
3590	1021	's why like it .

3598	1022	is pretty nonsensical point of view . 
3599	1022	If ASPECT_OBAMA adopted measures , especially ones about deporting people and economic regression would come about from stopping free trade , I would sooner vote for I dog as write in than ASPECT_OBAMA under circumstances . 
3600	1022	I also like fact that right wingers constantly blather on about free market . 
3601	1022	And yet in action , and even specific policy rhetoric wingers oppose free market at turn . 
3602	1022	Opposition to free trade , is opposition to free market . 
3603	1022	Opposition to free movement of labor is opposition to free market . 
3604	1022	is why I can not stomach hypocritical right wing stupidity . 
3605	1022	They claim to support free market , and yet THEY oppose free market THEY time . 
3606	1022	THEY claim to be in favor of freedom , but THEY oppose freedom time . 
3607	1022	reality is , right wing agenda can be summed up as , `` I want free market for I , I do n't care about else . 
3608	1022	And I want freedom for I , I do n't care about else . 
3609	1022	Unless of course I need ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE like unemployment , SS , or Medicare , then I love government -LRB- but ASSISTANCE should n't benefit poor or brown , then I will oppose ASPECT_BROWN -rrb- . 
3610	1023	You mean he does things led to recession ? 
3611	1023	We already witnessed term effects of reagans irrational ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY . 
3612	1023	REAGANS were disastrous . 
3613	1023	No one who properly understands could possibly want ASPECT_OBAMA to follow disastrous path . 
3614	1024	Never in your lifetime have conservatives held power . 
3615	1024	Do not confuse CONSERVATIVES with Republicans . 
3616	1024	After several years , we can all see destruction that liberal , progressive , marxist , and\/or communist policies cause - when CONSERVATIVES run executive , house , and ASPECT_SENATE 
3618	1025	Another person irrelevantly pointing out fox news ratings , and comparing them to ASPECT_MSNBC . 
3619	1025	I am very liberal , and would n't watch MSNBC for reason . 
3620	1025	I actually watch ASPECT_FOX significantly more often . 
3621	1025	And if there is major and serious news story , I watch ASPECT_CNN . 
3622	1025	is difference between right and left . 
3623	1025	left wingers think for WINGERS , WINGERS do n't let tv news channel think for WINGERS . 
3625	1026	And no where in my post did MY suggest that . 
3626	1026	But from your posts we can easily conclude that you must be another obama boot licker too dimwitted to understand mistake you made . 
3627	1026	At time ASPECT_OBAMA appeared to have outmaneuvred hillary but was not yet nominee my summed up how dangerous licker presidency might become based on licker inexperience , lack of pragmatism , and liberal ideology . 
3628	1026	TIME did not take my 1 year into 1 presidency to feel vindicated of predictions my made during 1 campaign . 
3629	1026	mistakes are frequent , and damaging to ASPECT_REPUBLIC . 
3630	1027	Because it shows that notwithstanding fact that ASPECT_OBAMA lower ratings are constantly posted to show what crummy job ASPECT_OBAMA is doing , ratings at point in ASPECT_OBAMA_TENURE are likely to bear little resemblance to how ASPECT_OBAMA is judged in future . 
3632	1028	Is that why ASPECT_OBAMA_VOTER actually thought ASPECT_SARA ASPECT_PALIN said she could see ASPECT_RUSSIA from ASPECT_SHE_HOUSE in ASPECT_ALASKA ? 
3633	1028	is based on zogby study post election . 
3634	1028	data is on line if you want ELECTION . 
3635	1028	I guess you liberals let Saturday night live create reality for you . 
3636	1029	It was n't liberal policy to slash ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE and double military spending . 
3637	1029	BABY can understanding , looking back at wreckage is ASPECT_BUSH administration , why conservatives would now what to distance CONSERVATIVES and claim ASPECT_BUSH was `` liberal . 
3638	1029	`` Sorry . 
3639	1029	BABY your baby . 
3640	1029	YOUR put BABY in office twice . 
3641	1029	We do n't want BABY . 
3642	1030	You nailed it . 
3643	1030	ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_EXPANSION is exactly opposite of current regimes goals 
3644	1031	Stop projecting . 
3645	1031	ASPECT_BUSH , like it or not , was one of ASPECT_LIBERAL republicans ever elected . 
3646	1031	And never during BUSH presidency , were either chambers of ASPECT_CONGRESS , run by Conservatives . 
3647	1031	You may be able to rewrite history among conversations with your obtuse liberal friends , but not here . 
3648	1032	Also they do n't show comparison with candidates . 
3649	1032	's question . 
3650	1032	ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH had about 42 &#37; approval rating when ASPECT_BUSH was reelected in 2004 . 
3651	1032	times ... especially in times of war ... Americans will choose to keep guy in charge in charge so as not to mix up war strategy . 
3652	1033	lol wut ? 
3653	1033	Republicans ran house and ASPECT_SENATE for 6 years during ASPECT_BUSH rein . 
3654	1033	You may not like republicans are called conservatives but 's what conservatives are considered . 
3656	1033	If you want to change what term means to Americans you can go ahead and try . 
3657	1033	But you have n't done TERM yet . 
3658	1033	Conservatives were in charge of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY and therefore conservatives were in charge for 6 out of 8 years of ASPECT_BUSH . 
3659	1033	economy started ECONOMY recession in 2007 . 
3660	1033	Democrats only gained `` control -LRB- if you want to call 49 repubs and 49 dems in senate control -RRB- in 2007 . 
3661	1033	So democrats created recession within year of DEMOCRATS taking over ASPECT_CONGRESS ?! 
3662	1033	Man that takes skill ! 
3663	1033	Get real . 
3664	1033	Republicans\/conservatives caused mess . 
3665	1033	And MESS ones now opposing ASPECT_OBAMA move MAN makes . 
3666	1033	I think fact that we are doing opposite of what guys want is good . 
3667	1034	label game playing . 
3668	1034	ASPECT_BUSH ran as conservative , was supported by conservatives , and followed conservative fiscal policies . 
3669	1034	Again , I appreciate your wanting to disown ASPECT_BUSH . 
3670	1034	Maybe we should trust you time ? 
3671	1034	There 's old saying in ASPECT_TENNESSEE , I know ASPECT_TENNESSEE 's in ASPECT_TEXAS , probably in ASPECT_TENNESSEE , says fool I once , shame on , shame on you . 
3672	1034	Fool I ... ca n't get fooled again . 
3673	1035	I do n't understand reasoning . 
3674	1035	Liberals voted against ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_BUSH policies not once . 
3675	1035	Not twice . 
3676	1035	But 3 times in ASPECT_PAST_DECADE . 
3677	1035	How could ASPECT_BUSH possibly be liberal . 
3678	1036	I think logic goes ... Liberals are to blame for everything , so since ASPECT_BUSH administration was one of worst in history , ASPECT_BUSH must be liberal . 
3679	1036	's way I can figure WAY . 
3680	1037	Another dimwitted ASPECT_OBAMA supporter incapable of critical thought . 
3681	1037	If Republicans are Conservatives in your small mind ... ... Are Democrats Communists ???? 
3682	1037	thanks in advance 
3683	1038	She did !! 
3684	1038	SHE did n't say `` SHE can see ASPECT_RUSSIA from ASPECT_SHE_HOUSE SHE said along lines of interaction . 
3685	1038	Interviewer -LRB- who ASPECT_PALIN think was charlie gibson -rrb- : What do you say to people that say you do n't have enough experience or knowledge of foreign policy issues ? 
3686	1038	`` Palin : `` Well palin know there charlie , INTERVIEWER have been governor of ASPECT_ALASKA and ASPECT_PALIN can see ASPECT_RUSSIA from ASPECT_ALASKA . 
3687	1038	gives interviewer foreign ASPECT_POLICY_EXPERIENCE . 
3688	1038	`` is horrendously idiotic statement . 
3689	1038	ASPECT_ALASKA is just as stupid as saying ASPECT_PALIN can see ASPECT_RUSSIA from palin house . 
3690	1038	ASPECT_ALASKA conveys message . 
3691	1038	ASPECT_SNL just added house part for bit of comedic effect . 
3692	1038	ASPECT_PALIN ca n't see significant difference . 
3693	1038	Maybe you can explain to ASPECT_PALIN why it is ok to say YOU have foreign ASPECT_POLICY_EXPERIENCE because YOU can see ASPECT_RUSSIA from part of YOU state YOU have never been to , but it is somehow silly to say about seeing from YOU house . 
3694	1038	ASPECT_RUSSIA is exactly , and if one is stupider , it is one ASPECT_PALIN said . 
3695	1038	At least if she could actually see ASPECT_RUSSIA from ASPECT_SHE_HOUSE , ASPECT_RUSSIA might be form of strange logic . 
3696	1038	Instead SHE can not see ASPECT_RUSSIA , has never seen ASPECT_RUSSIA , and SHE claims that ASPECT_RUSSIA proximity to ASPECT_ALASKA somehow give she foreign ASPECT_POLICY_EXPERIENCE just seem even stupider . 
3698	1039	And his ASPECT_POLL_NUMBER partly tanked because Conservatives became more and more angry with HIS policies . 
3699	1039	As for label game playing , you appear to be very good at PLAYING . 
3700	1040	lol huh ? 
3701	1040	they call themselves conservative ! 
3703	1040	THEY 's not hard to understand . 
3704	1040	ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH is what country thinks of when they think conservative policy . 
3705	1041	ThanksYet , majority of ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTER believe she did . 
3706	1041	It isnt surprising ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICY attract stupid people . 
3707	1042	There are plenty of stupid people on both sides . 
3708	1042	But if you want to play game -LRB- which is cheap one -RRB- I can show you plenty of polls show educated people support ASPECT_OBAMA over ASPECT_PALIN . 
3710	1043	ASPECT_SUSAN ASPECT_COLLINS calls herself ASPECT_CONSERVATIVE ? 
3711	1043	ASPECT_SCOTT ASPECT_BROWN ? 
3712	1043	olympia snow ? 
3713	1043	john mckain -LRB- when snow isnt running for re-election -rrb- ? 
3714	1043	arlen specter -LRB- see mckain -rrb- ??? 
3715	1043	I can go on , but I can see you are not really interested in reality 
3717	1044	Look in mirror . 
3718	1044	ASPECT_OBAMA boot lickers are , so you at least have company . 
3719	1045	Yes you are half way there . 
3720	1045	ASPECT_REAGAN policies led to rapid ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_EXPANSION , followed by rapid private sector collapse . 
3721	1045	So we can either follow ASPECT_REAGAN model and get years like 84-85 and have 5 growth , which will then be followed by 10 loss . 
3722	1045	Or WE can follow post WWII keynsian model saw longest period of uninterrupted global expansion in human history . 
3723	1045	Maybe WE never saw one or 2 years of massive growth , but WE never saw rapid declines either . 
3724	1045	If YEARS was n't for massive deregulation campaign undertaken between 1981 and 2008 , WE would not be in recession WE are now in . 
3725	1045	There can of course be over regulation , and if occurs deregulation makes sense . 
3726	1045	But constant deregulation left markets to whims , and WE saw outcomes followed . 
3728	1046	They call they conservatives . 
3730	1048	I 'll add you to list of completely ignorant ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTER who post here . 
3731	1049	Since you are now resorting to insults I think it is safe to say we have maxed out your intellectual capacity . 
3732	1049	Thanks for playing . 
3734	1049	Have balloon . 
3735	1050	good grief is idiotic . 
3736	1050	Let me know how well that regulation goes especially when regulators are busy watching porn instead of doing REGULATORS jobsand love affair jobsand boot lickers have with ASPECT_KEYNES is quite interesting but you 've sort of been backed into corner defending JOBSAND 
3737	1051	In what way was he liberal ? 
3738	1051	What sort of revisionism is ? 
3739	1051	ASPECT_BUSH was terrible president , so now we have right ASPECT_WING_LIAR trying to say LIBERAL was liberal ?? 
3740	1051	I suppose there issues you could say LIBERAL was liberal about , immigration for example . 
3741	1051	But you could also spin and say LIBERAL supported free market , and supported free movement of labor , so ASPECT_LIBERAL did n't want to intervene with market . 
3742	1051	Which is what strict labor immigration control is . 
3743	1051	What else was ASPECT_BUSH liberal about ? 
3744	1051	LIBERAL spent lot !! 
3745	1051	But is conservative trait in modern world not liberal one . 
3746	1051	3 ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRESIDENT we had spent like lunatics . 
3747	1051	ASPECT_REAGAN , ASPECT_BUSH , and ASPECT_BUSH . 
3748	1051	ASPECT_CLINTON balanced budget . 
3749	1051	No liberal would ever advocate for years of insane deficit spending , which is right wing has ever done in countries history other than wwii era . 
3750	1051	What could even remotely be twisted into liberal stance ? 
3751	1051	ASPECT_BUSH cut taxes . 
3753	1051	Opposed social freedoms . 
3754	1051	Opposed abortion . 
3755	1051	All things are conservative . 
3756	1051	So your attempts to rewrite history might work among your braindead conservative hand puppets , but not among people with functioning brains . 
3757	1052	Good grief is idiotic . 
3758	1052	guy called post idiotic , and then guy argument was `` is idiotic followed by irrelevant nonsense and babbling . 
3759	1052	Hilarious when people makes arguments of child , and then insult others !! 
3760	1053	INSULT is not insult if INSULT is true . 
3761	1053	Are you going to answer question . 
3762	1053	Are Democrats , communists ???? 
3763	1053	is your logic . 
3764	1053	Or are you completely wrong suggesting conservatives held power during ASPECT_BUSH presidency ?? 
3765	1053	thanks in advance 
3766	1054	No they believed she said exactly what she actually said . 
3767	1054	right ASPECT_WING_LIAR tried to distort facts to change history . 
3768	1054	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN did say ability to see ASPECT_ALASKA from she state was foreign policy credential . 
3769	1054	is undoubtedly stupid , and conveys message as `` PALIN can see ASPECT_RUSSIA from palin house even if wording is different . 
3770	1054	levels of dishonesty you are stooping to are really low . 
3771	1054	Try to raise your game , you are starting to bore me . 
3772	1055	So , we 've to point where supporting Free market now equals being conservativethe party of ASPECT_JFK died time ago . 
3773	1055	How about work he did with drunk ASPECT_TED ASPECT_KENNEDY on education `` reform ?? 
3774	1055	expansion of government creating ASPECT_DEPARTMENT ASPECT_OF ASPECT_HOMELAND_SECURITY ??? 
3775	1055	HE spent like drunken sailor - which is not conservative . 
3776	1056	Of course was not question asked . 
3777	1056	Did she say SHE could see COURSE from ASPECT_SHE_HOUSE ? 
3778	1056	ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTER say ... ... . 
3780	1056	Of course . 
3780	1056	did . 
3781	1056	Its boring you because you cant handle facts . 
3782	1057	Yes it is . 
3783	1057	is what modern conservatives do . 
3784	1057	ASPECT_REAGAN spent like drunken sailor than ASPECT_BUSH , and ASPECT_REAGAN actually increased debt more than ASPECT_BUSH comparable to time periods -LRB- in words ASPECT_BUSH increased debt more by , but reagan greater percentage -rrb- . 
3785	1057	education reform was not something liberal would ever support , is for sure . 
3786	1057	Nor is oppressive actions taken to fight war on terror . 
3787	1057	is moderates like ASPECT_OBAMA do , and conservatives like ASPECT_BUSH do . 
3788	1057	Not liberals . 
3790	1058	Then you are pointing out irrelevancies . 
3791	1058	People were confused about wordings of palin statement , and is sign of what ? 
3792	1058	You remember word that ASPECT_PALIN ever said as quote ? 
3793	1058	Of course not . 
3794	1058	You remember ASPECT_BASIC_PREMISE of things she said . 
3795	1058	ASPECT_BASIC_PREMISE of what SHE said was incredibly similar to `` SHE can see ASPECT_RUSSIA from she house ps . 
3796	1058	I am liberal and I know exactly what she said . 
3797	1058	So really , your point is without merit . 
3798	1058	fact that people got confused about wording of answer ASPECT_SARAH ASPECT_PALIN gave is irrelevant to anything I was actually talking about . 
3799	1059	educate yourself will yai even included ASPECT_WASHINGTON post link , written in 2007 . 
3800	1059	ASPECT_BUSH was ASPECT_LIBERAL ASPECT_REPUBLICAN is not new news , however , considering how you must need REPUBLICAN to be conservative , so your ideology doesnt get too close to being of soviet union , or ASPECT_VENEZUELA - we can all understand how desperate you need ASPECT_BUSH \ \/ conservative myth to be believed . 
3801	1059	Not 3 crummy links will change your mind , but ASPECT_HECK ASPECT_COHEN and wash post wrote about post years agoBush Neoliberalhttp : \ \/ \ \/ www.washingtonpost.com \ \/ wp-dyn ... 052801053 .

3802	1060	I will accept as admission that ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTER are more likely to be guided by Saturday night live skit than reality . 
3803	1060	Or ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTER were\/are gullible village idiots who actually believed ASPECT_OBAMA was going to lower taxes , that SUPPORTERS could keep supporters health care , and so on and so onthe hard part for you is , game is over and Independents -LRB- and hopefully democrats -RRB- finally wised up 
3804	1062	Ah you mean whole spreading democracy throughout world . 
3805	1062	Well was old school ASPECT_AMERICAN liberalism for sure . 
3806	1062	is though , has been policy of both ASPECT_REPUBLICAN and ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC presidents since start of cold war . 
3807	1062	Pre-WWII I would agree conservative position tended to be isolationist and liberal tended to have expansive and optimistic foreign policy goals . 
3808	1062	has n't been true very often since point . 
3809	1062	And POINT absolutely has n't been true at least since 70sI think your problem is , you seem to be confusing libertarianism with conservatism . 
3810	1062	Even that link you gave said ASPECT_BUSH was conservative , ASPECT_BUSH just believed in liberal policies . 
3811	1062	truth is ASPECT_BUSH is reagan style conservative . 
3812	1062	Insane spending . 
3813	1062	Belief in using foreign policy to promote and spread democracy . 
3815	1062	ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
3816	1062	is ASPECT_REAGAN playbook copied by ASPECT_GW_BUSH . 
3817	1062	Yet you seem to like ASPECT_REAGAN and call ASPECT_BUSH liberal . 
3818	1062	When they have so similarities does n't make sense . 
3819	1063	hard part for you is I strongly oppose ASPECT_OBAMA presidency . 
3820	1063	I have n't defended ASPECT_OBAMA_ONCE , and if you look at I vote I said I would n't vote for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
3821	1063	So is clearly not explanation . 
3822	1064	LIBERTARIAN think your problem is projecting . 
3823	1064	LIBERTARIAN am registered libertarian who voted for ASPECT_MICHAEL ASPECT_BADNERIK in 2004 , and wrote in ASPECT_RON_PAUL in 2008 - and more often than not , voted Libertarians when given choice . 
3824	1064	Although ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN will admit , LIBERTARIAN have never voted for communist with by libertarians name . 
3825	1064	LIBERTARIAN apologize for not coming into voting age when Democrats were still Democrats and not marxists 
3826	1065	Then I apologize for projecting bit myself 
3827	1066	FACT that ASPECT_BUSH was not Conservative , does NOT mean PRESIDENT was liberal . 
3828	1066	PRESIDENT spent like one but did n't tax like one . 
3829	1066	ASPECT_BUSH was fiscally bad president . 
3830	1066	And probably best called moderate ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
3831	1066	True conservatives and moderate to conservative independents agree that ASPECT_BUSH left much to be desired , especially in spending area . 
3832	1066	What befuddles world -LRB- among things -RRB- is how liberals blame ASPECT_BUSH for including excess spending , YET say obummer is doing GOOD by spending 3 times as much ????????? 
3833	1066	WORLD guess liberal , dreamland , `` perfect world , mind has no need for logic . 
3834	1067	AgreedI missed where he credited ASPECT_CLINTON with balancing budget and completely ignored ASPECT_REPUBLICAN takeover in 94 and Contract with Americawho believes , had not happened , ASPECT_CLINTON would have balanced budget with democratic controlled house ? 
3835	1068	It was 1995 Republicans took over . 
3836	1068	1995 is speculation as to what would have happened . 
3837	1068	But Dems passed 1993 ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE flooded ASPECT_TREASURY with revenues which gave us surplus budget , and deficit was falling rapidly in two years before Republicans got control . 
3838	1068	Furthermore , ASPECT_US saw once ASPECT_BUSH got into office that ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS was n't exactly thrifty when CONGRESS comes to spending . 
3839	1068	Year - `` on-budget deficit\/surplus1992 -340.41993 -300.4 -LRB- - ASPECT_CLINTON takes office1994 -258.81995 -226.4 -LRB- - Republicans take control of Congress1996 -174.01997 -103.21998 -29.91999 1.9 source : ASPECT_CBO . 
3840	1068	govThe deficits had already fallen 33 &#37; in years before Republicans took ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
3841	1069	And is borderline delusional `` Right ASPECT_WING_LIAR distort facts and change history when attempting to correct what Saturday night live said versus ASPECT_SARA ASPECT_PALIN ? 
3842	1069	actually quite entertaining . 
3843	1070	Yes , but it is commonly referred to as 1994 takeover which is when election was . 
3844	1070	Remember IT , because we will be referring to Americans taking back House time around as 2010 takeover 
3845	1071	Not in my experience . 
3846	1071	You 're not who incorrectly stated Republicans took over in 1994 . 
3847	1071	And Republicans will retain congress in 2002 and ASPECT_MCCAIN will win election in 2004 . 
3848	1071	Folks predict kinds of things . 
3849	1072	Like ASPECT_OBAMA being pragmatic centrist 
3850	1074	Fair enough , people can say that to refer to election . 
3851	1074	I think we 've got record straight people did n't take control of ASPECT_CONGRESS until 1995 , after deficit had been declining rapidly for two years . 
3852	1075	election was in 1994 but they did n't get into office until 1995 . 
3853	1075	Just like ASPECT_BUSH had control of ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE when 2009 deficit was predicted to be staggering 1.2 trillion dollars even before we knew full extent of financial crash . 
3854	1077	What question and who are you addressing ? 
3856	1078	He 's asking ME if calling republicans conservative is as calling democrats communists . 
3858	1079	Libs do n't compare ASPECT_OBAMA to Bushed or Puppet Master dick . 
3859	1079	We realize that WE have so much better . 
3860	1079	Get with program . 
3861	1079	ASPECT_OBAMA has lot skills than bozo we had before or McSame was trying to take OBAMA place . 
3862	1079	I believe your vision is blinded by your ideology and you are not able to see . 
3863	1079	No , that Reps\/cons did n't want . 
3865	1079	is what ASPECT_BOEHNER and rest of ASPECT_GOP who have REPS\/CONS head up so far into reps\/cons butts reps\/cons ca n't see that ASPECT_WALL_STREET is taking us to cleaners , and does n't care because REPS\/CONS are in ASPECT_WALL_STREET pocket . 
3867	1079	is why so rep congressmen were so eager to take money and take photo ops admitting MONEY was creating jobs . 
3868	1079	Your rhetoric reeks of right-wing anger , jealousy and erronious crap . 
3869	1079	buffoon ASPECT_US had before made us laughing stock of world , thank ASPECT_GOD for eloquent speaker ASPECT_US are no longer butt of jokes . 
3870	1079	Faux news type lies . 
3871	1079	Reps\/cons are so ignorant reps\/cons wanted ASPECT_OBAMA to plug hole . 
3872	1079	ASPECT_OBAMA handled crisis much more intelligently than dumb ASPECT_BUSH handled Katrina . 
3873	1079	More lies . 
3874	1079	Post facts if you want to be credible instead of repeating rethoric you hear on fixed noise . 
3875	1079	Self-serving reps\/cons would like moratorium lifted , and if another spill occurs , they can whine and blame ASPECT_OBAMA for not taking action and declaring moratorium . 
3876	1079	We 're talking about Bush\/Cheney , no ? 
3877	1079	I agree . 
3878	1079	It was Justice dept did suing , but ignorant cons do n't realize . 
3879	1079	And , ASPECT_DOJ is just keeping with Constitution , that Reps\/cons do n't seem to understand . 
3880	1079	REPS\/CONS claim REPS\/CONS love Constitution but do n't mind shredding CONSTITUTION or letting reps\/cons leaders -LRB- Bush\/Cheney -RRB- shred CONSTITUTION . 
3881	1079	Selfish reps do n't have empathy for lost reps jobs , REPS are just interested in helping ASPECT_BP and corporations keep CORPORATIONS millions so CORPORATIONS can pay corporations ceo big bonuses . 
3882	1079	And ASPECT_BP would all be considered BS . 
3883	1080	I agree with everything you said , except for ASPECT_STORMFRONT , and is because I 've never been on forum - probably would n't want to , we have enough inane posters on forum . 
3884	1082	+1 spot on 
3885	1083	Oh , another complainer does n't have candidate they can claim can do better . 
3886	1083	We know how far ASPECT_PAUL got ! 
3888	1083	And from your posts we can easily conclude that you are ASPECT_OBAMA_HATER with no facts other than Faux news type rhetoric being repeated by con sheeple . 
3889	1083	's what happens when peabrains try to understand\/explain issues beyond peabrains comprehension . 
3890	1083	Your predictions as well as your assumptions can all be classified as bunch of BS . 
3891	1083	mistakes were already made by ASPECT_PREVIOU_ADMINISTRATION , may PEABRAINS never , ever , be in charge again ! 
3892	1084	closeI asked if you were ready to admit you were wrong . 
3893	1084	Not in your lifetime has government been controlled by Conservatives . 
3894	1085	I 'll add you to list too . 
3895	1086	too easy 
3896	1087	Actually , according to ASPECT_QUINNIPIAC , fictitious letter currently does better according to Americathats how badly DOINGWHAT is doingwhat fall from `` grace `` http : \ \/ \ \/ www.google.com \ \/ #hl = en & source = ... fb550a2476ba2a 
3897	1090	Ask YOUR if YOUR give -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- about your -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ing list ! 
3898	1091	Your link is faulty , sort of like your posts . 
3899	1092	I take as yes . 
3900	1092	OK bolsheivik . 
3901	1092	enjoy your dictatorship !! 
3902	1093	In dictatorship , there is one party-rule by force , not by choice . 
3903	1093	Therefore PARTY-RULE find your little retort laughable and ignorant . 
3905	1094	Mertex said they do n't deserve power , what hell relevance does have to Bolshevism ? 
3906	1094	Did Mertex say party should sieze control and stop Republicans from taking control ? 
3907	1094	Certainly not . 
3908	1094	But who was even semi-conscious between 2001 and 2009 must understand how disastrous ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONTROL is . 
3909	1094	Maybe one ASPECT_DAY_PEOPLE , when PEOPLE realize Democrats suck , will not then turn to Republicans only to realize PEOPLE also suck , just to turn back to Democrats . 
3910	1094	Maybe one ASPECT_DAY_PEOPLE will wake up and break cycle . 
3911	1094	There is no doubt that Republicans do not deserve power with people record though . 
3912	1094	I would rather give power to ASPECT_LINDSAY ASPECT_LOHAN after week long coke binge . 
3913	1095	lol one conservative using words they do n't understand . 
3914	1095	Maybe THEY should pay attention to dem dar fancy book readin types . 
3915	1096	YOURSELF appear to be guilty of yourself . 
3916	1096	Suggesting ASPECT_OLYMPIA ASPECT_SNOWE , ASPECT_SUSAN ASPECT_COLLINS , arlen specter and ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_MCKAIN are self appointed conservatives is certainly using words you simply do not understand . 
3917	1097	yes , but as in thread , Can named ASPECT_REPUBLICAN beat yes . 
3919	1097	i just dont see . 
3919	1097	with way ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY has been going ... Get as center as possible -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- possible ... forget about your mighty social high horse that scares away voters but keep conservative spending . 
3920	1098	Conservatism in it 's basic definition is political ideology is against ASPECT_NEW_PROGRAM . 
3921	1098	Everyone in ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY is in general against new government programs . 
3922	1098	Therefore they fit under conservative ideology . 
3923	1098	There are multiple subfactions of conservatism . 
3924	1098	Including libertarians . 
3925	1098	But neo cons of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY are no less conservative than libertarians . 
3926	1098	I am not wrong . 
3927	1098	I just do n't have political agenda to redefine conservativism to separate republican from neo cons and ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH . 
3928	1099	For sake of argument I will not correct your flawed definition and statements but accept them to make point . 
3929	1099	Following your logic , and absolute unwillingness to admit you are wrong , then Democrats are Communists . 
3930	1099	It is n't much of secret that COMMUNISTS are , but I 'd really like to see you type secret , or agree with TYPE . 
3931	1099	Then again , reading you attempt to squirm your way around , is sufficiently entertaining . 
3932	1100	No because basic defintion of communism is desire for state to take complete control of businesses . 
3933	1100	Not single democrat has proposed . 
3934	1100	You are truly doing poor job displaying your knowledge of political ideologies and definitions . 
3935	1101	You should n't be so quick to criticize skippyAfter , argument you are feebly attempting to make is that Republicans are Conservatives . 
3936	1101	I 'll leave SKIPPYAFTER up to objective readers out there in internet land to decide which of two of us is doing poor job at displaying knowledge . 
3938	1104	lol \*\*\* ASPECT_MOD_EDIT - ASPECT_PERSONAL_ATTACK deleted \*\*\* \* is not at scientific test . 
3939	1104	Especially since EDIT does n't have another candidate to compare to . 
3940	1104	would n't want to vote for ASPECT_OBAMA but hate ASPECT_SARAH ASPECT_PALIN even so vote for ASPECT_OBAMA to keep her out . 
3941	1105	also there needs to be maybe option , then again id hope everyone would select maybe . 
3942	1105	I would n't make up your mind too early and without proper research first . 
3943	1107	When we are dealing with posters -LRB- and sadly voters -RRB- like ASPECT_TAO who actually believes ASPECT_OLYMPIA ASPECT_SNOWE and ASPECT_SUSAN ASPECT_COLLINS are conservatives , how can you expect POSTERS to grasp even simplest of reasons why ASPECT_OBAMA numbers are tanking ? 
3945	1108	That you are comparing country to right-leaning forum poll just shows how lacking in knowledge and logic people are . 
3946	1108	fact that there are in favor in clearly right-wing forum is cause for alarm for right , I would say . 
3947	1108	Clear thinking ? 
3948	1108	I think not , more delusional . 
3949	1109	ASPECT_LOL you figure board is representative of clear thinking americans ? 
3950	1109	You have n't read posts . 
3951	1109	Well , maybe on second thought , you have . 
3952	1110	Thanks lot ! 
3954	1111	Clearly EXPERT are expert in field of being delusional . 
3955	1111	I posted : `` AS of TODAY ! 
3956	1111	Overall , 44 of VOTERS say VOTERS at least somewhat approve of president performance . 
3957	1111	Fifty-six percent -LRB- 56 -RRB- disapprove .25 of VOTERS , Strongly approve -LRB- liberals & parasites , mostly parasites -rrb- of way ASPECT_B.O. is preforming as President . 
3958	1111	While 45 of voters strongly disapprove of job B.O. is doing . 
3959	1111	numbers dreaming libs . 
3960	1111	wo n't like . 
3961	1111	`` , not or one or two , neutral polling company has similar results . 
3962	1111	You can laughingly post radical liberal polling company but COMPANY will be meaningless . 
3963	1111	neutral polling companies have B.O. going down tubes . 
3964	1111	To Republican and even to Democrats . 
3965	1111	is how bad b.o. star has fallen . 
3966	1111	Democrats and even liberal democrats are looking at idea of dumping REPUBLICAN . 
3967	1111	Radical RIGHT wing pollsters do n't show B.O. numbers to be lot worse than neutral companies , POLLSTERS do n't have to . 
3968	1111	B.O. incompetent , radical Socialist clown , further destroys ASPECT_B.O. with passing day , gaff , screw-up , and lie . 
3969	1112	You liberals are always delusional s s i s. Please read belowGee can someone tell I if LIBERALS think democrats might do !!!!! 
3970	1112	duhhh ... . 
3971	1112	If ASPECT_REPUBLICAN does n't like guns , REPUBLICAN doesn t buy one . 
3972	1112	If Democrat does n't like guns , DEMOCRAT wants guns outlawed . 
3973	1112	If Republican is vegetarian , REPUBLICAN doesn eat meat . 
3974	1112	If Democrat is vegetarian , DEMOCRAT wants meat products banned for everyone . 
3975	1112	If Republican is homosexual , REPUBLICAN quietly leads ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_LIFE . 
3976	1112	If Democrat is homosexual , DEMOCRAT demands legislated respect . 
3977	1112	If Republican is down-and-out , REPUBLICAN thinks about how to better republican situation . 
3978	1112	Democrat wonders who is going to take care of DEMOCRAT . 
3979	1112	If ASPECT_REPUBLICAN does n't like talk show host , ASPECT_REPUBLICAN switches channels . 
3980	1112	Democrats demand that DEMOCRATS do n't like be shut down . 
3981	1112	If ASPECT_REPUBLICAN is non-believer , ASPECT_REPUBLICAN does n't go to church . 
3982	1112	Democrat non-believer wants mention of god and religion silenced . 
3983	1112	If Republican decides ASPECT_REPUBLICAN needs ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE , REPUBLICAN goes about shopping for CARE , or may choose job provides CARE . 
3984	1112	Democrat demands that rest of us pay for DEMOCRAT . 
3985	1112	If ASPECT_REPUBLICAN reads , REPUBLICAN 'll forward THIS so ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_FRIEND can have good laugh . 
3986	1112	Democrat will delete because DEMOCRAT `` offended . 
3987	1112	Ca n't wait for ASPECT_OBAMA_PRICK to get h3ll out of office . 
3988	1112	Worse than ASPECT_BUSH . 
3989	1114	only ASPECT_OBAMA_VOTER are allowed to be on friend list , you are one of uskeep up good fight 
3990	1115	el oh elthe numbers are not that far off from polls even democrats are conductingel oh elcnn , ASPECT_QUINNIPIAC , ASPECT_USA_TODAY , james carvilleonly around 40 currently think Charlatan deserves to be re-elected . 
3991	1115	STATEMENT sad statement on inability of critical thought of roughly 40 of ASPECT_AMERICANSCARVILLE poll is entertaining as majority of ASPECT_AMERICANS now agree that Socialist is accurate description of dear leadergoogleel oh el 
3992	1116	economy may eventually turn around , in spite of ASPECT_OBAMA . 
3993	1116	So , basing your vote for ASPECT_OBAMA on economy may be unfounded and without merit . 
3994	1117	lol wow ... 
3995	1118	Good point . 
3996	1118	I 'm sure poll here at PF scientifically represents opinions of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE . 
3998	1119	There is not single poll anywhere at point in time said ASPECT_OBAMA stands to lose 2 to 1 to ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
3999	1119	Even generic nameless republicans . 
4000	1121	Try paying attention to amount of people who think they will vote for ASPECT_HIM , which is what poll in thread asks . 
4001	1121	roughly 40 according to ones I referenced . 
4003	1121	I know how much you dislike AMOUNT . 
4004	1122	el oh elThats best you could do ? 
4005	1122	thread poll , is not far off from others . 
4006	1122	See above post . 
4007	1122	Deal with POLL . 
4008	1123	Deal with it ? 
4009	1123	lol pass . 
4010	1123	I do n't need to deal with irrelevant nonsense . 
4011	1123	But feel free to show us polls show 34 &#37; would vote for ASPECT_OBAMA in election . 
4012	1124	FYI , I was n't responding to your post , but to 4Horse - and yes , it is delusional because everyone knows Forum leans way right ! 
4013	1124	So what , polls go up and down depending on what President did day before , whether YES liked BEFORE or not . 
4014	1124	proof will be in 2012 . 
4015	1124	Libs\/Dems are too smart to put stock into LIBS\/DEMS , but go ahead and let LIBS\/DEMS make your day . 
4016	1124	You will need happy days to remember , when nov 2012 comes along . 
4017	1124	Well , DAYS appears from your radical ranting that you either are very immature or right-winger has n't been around long enough to know that polls do n't mean whole lot . 
4018	1124	may show displeasure now , would rather have President are familiar with and has done good rather than newcomer who knows where will lead us , especially if are Republican and believe nonsense got ASPECT_US in mess ASPECT_US are . 
4019	1126	Thank You , Thank you , I now understand that mature way to act when polls are against your ideas , is to then discount very idea of polling in place . 
4020	1126	Thank you for your `` insight into maturity . 
4021	1127	I 'm sure you will understand when you get older - like in nov 2012 . 
4022	1128	November 2012 ? 
4023	1128	You mean when we get rid of incompetent lying clown in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE ? 
4024	1128	November 2012 ? 
4025	1128	One of us WILL learn lesson and ONE wo n't be senior citizen , sonny ! 
4026	1130	might be erroneous , but how is erroneously calling racist , racist ? 
4027	1130	How is that negative or prejudical statement based on race ? 
4028	1131	If you would restate that in English , I may answer it . 
4029	1132	He said : How is falsely calling racist example of thinking certain race is superior or saying negative or prejudiced on basis of race -LRB- definition of racism -rrb- . 
4030	1132	words in he post were n't THAT big . 
4031	1132	Try to keep up . 
4032	1132	At least look up words you do n't understand . 
4033	1133	Let me know if you still ca n't understand it after ASPECT_BILL comment . 
4034	1135	If true , would be `` moronic . 
4035	1135	would not make them `` racist . 
4036	1135	I 'm not entirely sure you know what term means . 
4038	1136	I understood your assertion perfectly time . 
4039	1136	Let I make I position bit simpler , if I can . 
4040	1136	`` racist , by definition , is one who discriminates or is prejudiced against others or villifies OTHERS based on others race . 
4041	1136	Now , if liberal -LRB- or -RRB- calls `` racist based not on person race , but on OTHERS inability to conduct and intelligent argument , then liberal is not discriminating or being prejudiced against person based on race , but based on ignorance , right ? 
4042	1136	So by definition , does not indicate OTHERS are racist at , does DEFINITION ? 
4043	1136	Now , what were WHAT saying about being able to conduct intelligent argument ? 
4044	1136	In meantime , rest of us will just savor delicious irony of you calling liberals racist for calling others racists when being unable to conduct intelligent argument . 
4045	1137	As liberal , you naturally want to define racist in narrowest terms possible . 
4046	1137	However , in reality , -LRB- term foreign to liberals -RRB- playing ASPECT_RACE_CARD against and at opportunity is RACIST , whether you wish to acknowledge that or not . 
4047	1137	IE calling az law racist when REALITY is not , IS RACIST . 
4048	1138	wise man once said : `` Racism is simply ugly form of collectivism , mindset that views humans only as members of groups and never as individuals . 
4049	1138	Racists believe that individual who share superficial physical characteristics are alike ; as collectivists , racists think only in terms of groups . 
4050	1138	By encouraging americans to adopt group mentality , advocates of so-called `` diversity actually perpetuate racism . 
4051	1138	ADVOCATES intense focus on race is inherently racist , because FOCUS views individuals only as members of racial groups . 
4052	1138	conservatives and libertarians should fight back and challenge myth that collectivist liberals care more about racism . 
4053	1138	Modern liberalism , however well intentioned , is byproduct of collectivist thinking characterizes racism . 
4054	1138	continued insistence on group thinking only inflames racial tensions . 
4055	1138	- ASPECT_RON ASPECT_PAULYOU can read whole of statement here : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.lewrockwell.com\/paul\/paul68.html Also very interesting video involving ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and racism is here : YouTube - Who Racist ? 
4056	1139	Why is natural for liberal ? 
4059	1139	Well I suppose if you want to make up definitions lol can be anything you want LOL . 
4060	1139	In meantime , rest of us will just savor delicious irony of you talking about how `` reality is foreign term to liberals while you make up definitions not found in `` reality based dictionary or definition . 
4061	1140	How hell are conservatives going to fight about HELL when CONSERVATIVES do n't even know what `` racist means . 
4062	1140	Here we have Dan40 whose thinks word `` racist has absolutely to do with anything about race , prejudice , or discrimination . 
4063	1141	So since you are calling liberals racists thereby playing ASPECT_RACE_CARD , exactly what you accuse liberals of doing , does not make you racist too by your definition ? 
4064	1142	I 'm talking traditional concervative , who is really libertarian in todays terms . 
4065	1142	You are thinking of what might call Neo-concervative . 
4066	1142	are going to fight NEO-CONCERVATIVE , hopefully by reading that paper I gave link to , educating , and speaking sense . 
4067	1142	ought to be strategy for political and ethical individual hopes to eliminate unfounded inequality . 
4068	1142	may just be I opinion . 
4069	1142	Also I will say in regard to Dan40 , that calling law racist , does n't make racist , DAN40 makes ignorant of what racist means . 
4070	1142	document can not be racist . 
4071	1142	DOCUMENT can be written by racist , and DOCUMENT can defend racist actions , but document DOCUMENT can not be racist . 
4072	1142	Personally I do n't like ASPECT_ARIZONA law , as big states rights guy as I am , constitution gives power to regulate national borders to ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT . 
4073	1142	If states want to devote resources to help in endeavor is right , but to make laws in respect appears to be unconstitutional . 
4074	1142	I 'll have to look into ENDEAVOR bit more though . 
4075	1142	If arizona wants to pass law , then we need 28th amendment . 
4076	1143	ASPECT_RACE_CARD is liberal weapon to be used against that disagree with silly utopian dreams . 
4077	1143	And using WEAPON against who disagree is slur against people of color , so YES , calling people racist when PEOPLE are not , is insult , and therefore RACIST . 
4078	1144	Oh so now insult is racist ? 
4080	1145	typical liberal nonsense , you bend words to fit your purpose and use bent words as weapons . 
4081	1145	But when turned against you , suddenly you demand strictest ASPECT_LIBRARY ASPECT_OF ASPECT_CONGRESS definition of word . 
4082	1145	OPPORTUNISTS 're not racist opportunists , you are bullsh ! 
4083	1145	racist opportunists . 
4084	1146	I 'm supposed to believe person too lazy to give I link ? 
4085	1146	Your vote that I 'm laughably wrong is best you 've got ? 
4086	1146	I mother-in-law could hit harder ! 
4087	1146	There is another way you could prove I 'm wrong . 
4088	1146	Tell I how government knows I 'm looking for job if they stop asking question after I unemployment compensation has ended ? 
4089	1146	We should suppose government is psychic ? 
4090	1146	Actually explains lot ... 
4091	1147	I think factions are guilty of from time to time . 
4092	1147	I think MECHANISM is natural defense mechanism more often than MECHANISM is tactical plan . 
4093	1147	Hardly Liberal endeavor . 
4094	1148	years or so , agency changes its formula to make numbers look little sweeter . 
4095	1148	They also neglect to revaluate previous satistics , but post satistics together . 
4096	1148	Here is elementary example : before -- there were 7 yellow people and 3 green ppl unemployed equaling 10 &#37; of populationnow -- there are 10 yellow people and 10 green ppl equaling 20 of populationBefore for instance , PEOPLE counted yellow and greens in unemployment . 
4097	1148	So in mock example 10 of people are unemployed . 
4098	1148	Now PEOPLE stoped counting green people . 
4099	1148	so NOW looks like 10 unemployment . 
4100	1148	Therefore as far as we know , there has been little change . 
4101	1148	In terms government says WE have 10 unemployment and 2 inflation . 
4102	1148	In terms we used from very beginning -LRB- before -RRB- or unmanipulated ... WE actually have 22 unemployment and 6 inflation ... So yes , ASPECT_BUREAU ASPECT_OF ASPECT_LABOR ASPECT_SATISTICS is kind of bull . 
4103	1149	Sorry , but it is always liberals use ASPECT_WORD_RACIST as weapon against that disagree with them . 
4104	1149	words could apply equally to groups , but liberals have cornered market on using word , racist , as put down for dissent . 
4105	1150	How is using ASPECT_WORD_RACIST slur against people of color ? 
4106	1150	So when YOU call liberals racists are you slurring people of color ? 
4107	1150	Are you racist ? 
4108	1151	You 've being using ASPECT_WORD_RACIST as weapon for past 5 pages ! 
4109	1151	When did you start calling yourself liberal ? 
4110	1152	is not true at all . 
4111	1152	work force consists of who are working , or want to . 
4112	1153	What is source for assertions ? 
4113	1153	While ASPECT_BLS has improved ASPECT_BLS polling methodology , measure of standard unemployment rate -LRB- now called U-3 -RRB- has remained essentially unchanged for decades . 
4114	1155	I guess pain of reality is why you avoid PAIN at costs . 
4115	1155	You can call I racist if you wish , your opinion is to I , and you can brand I with nonsensical liberal brand too . 
4116	1155	Again , I do not care what your opinions are since your liberal opinions are silly , unworkable , illogical , and are constantly changed while denying failed idea ever existed . 
4117	1155	So say what you want , meaningless . 
4118	1156	You 've been hanged on by your words , not mine . 
4119	1157	Hanged by less than wisp of smoke , not hardly . 
4120	1158	Others can decide that for OTHERS . 
4121	1161	Sure dad . 
4122	1162	WOW , you have big family ! 
4123	1164	I like your signature . 
4124	1164	I slogan for November elections : IF YOU 'RE IN -------- YOU 'RE OUT 
4125	1165	From my ASPECT_PERSONAL_EXPERIENCE -LRB- family members and friends are ASPECT_REPUBLICAN -rrb- , there are lot of Republicans are racist . 
4126	1165	members insult blacks , hispanics and minorities for no reason and generalize negatively about MEMBERS . 
4127	1165	You have many of kind of people in your ASPECT_TEA_PARTY whether you want to admit KIND or not . 
4128	1165	Maybe Libs use ASPECT_RACE_CARD as weapon , but hey , when CARD out there in your face -LRB- racist signs at ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and negative comments made public -rrb- card is quite obvious , and CARD will be acknowledged . 
4129	1166	If your compensation has ended , why would government care if you are still looking or not ? 
4130	1166	You would be one would be suffering , ergo , ONE would be up to you to do about ONE . 
4131	1167	And mostly Republicans\/conservatives actually act racist . 
4132	1167	If you do n't like ASPECT_WORD_RACIST , do n't be one . 
4133	1167	Do n't generalize about minorities , do n't insult without cause , do n't be afraid minorities are going to take your job , do n't be afraid minorities are going to take over country and make you slave . 
4134	1167	Watch : YouTube - Misconceptions of ASPECT_OBAMA_FUEL_REPUBLICAN ... 
4135	1168	Once again liberal uses ASPECT_RACE_CARD as weapon . 
4136	1168	And tries to tell REPUBLICAN how to act and how to conduct ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_LIFE . 
4137	1168	Well REPUBLICAN am not afraid of taking ASPECT_REPUBLICAN job because ASPECT_REPUBLICAN 'm retired . 
4138	1168	And REPUBLICAN did not worry about taking republican job before ASPECT_REPUBLICAN retired because no one did ONE as well . 
4139	1168	tried . 
4140	1168	And before ASPECT_REPUBLICAN 'm made into slave republican 'll be cadaver . 
4141	1168	And REPUBLICAN 'd hope to take bunch with REPUBLICAN . 
4142	1168	And REPUBLICAN 'm NOT Republican . 
4143	1168	REPUBLICAN 'm for replacing incumbents of both parties and instituting strict term limits for replacements . 
4144	1168	REPUBLICAN find Democrats to be only marginally worse than Republicans . 
4145	1168	And liberals are simply insane and out of touch with reality . 
4146	1169	Sly ; speaking of nutz that `` BIMBO has bigger balls than politician out there and ASPECT_BIMBO for one think we need BALLS in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE . 
4147	1172	Arguments are over facts . 
4148	1172	Opinions are for voting . 
4149	1172	LIBERAL 'm for individual freedoms and liberties . 
4150	1172	Why then do LIBERAL like ASPECT_OBAMA ? 
4151	1172	LIBERAL 'm ASPECT_LIBERAL . 
4152	1172	Why then do LIBERAL dislike ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY ? 
4153	1172	Be careful with generalizations . 
4154	1174	Are you kidding me ? 
4155	1174	If you are for individual freedoms and liberties you can not support ASPECT_OBAMA ! 
4156	1174	oxymoron . 
4157	1174	YOURSELF are lieing to yourself me friend .

4168	1174	Give me liberty or give me death !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
4169	1176	I gave you link to ASPECT_BLS . 
4170	1176	You wrote link off as ASPECT_BS . 
4171	1176	You wrote out institution is responsible for counting unemployment as BS . 
4172	1176	I do n't understand how interested in politics could be so bullheaded and willfully ignorant . 
4173	1176	Do -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -lrb- -RRB- ing research and you wo n't look so dumb ! 
4174	1176	INSTITUTION hilarious that you call I too lazy when I already provided you with link to answer your questions and you very clearly have not read . 
4175	1176	Here is answers : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.bls.gov\/cps\/cps_htgm.htm #where 
4176	1177	And result of that expensive bls effort is that if person benefits have expired and they have given up trying to find job . 
4177	1177	According to ASPECT_BLS they are NO longer unemployed . 
4178	1177	unemployment rate dropped from 9.7 to 9.5 couple of months ago , NOT because people had found work , but because ASPECT_BLS said 652,000 , formerly unemployed , people had , `` LEFT ASPECT_LABOR_FORCE ! 
4179	1177	`` PEOPLE choose to believe democrat\/liberal pols and disbelieve republican\/conservative pols . 
4180	1177	operative word is UNEMPLOYED are pols . 
4180	1177	, UNEMPLOYED both lie !!!! 
4181	1177	We NEED part-time , non-career legislators , not power mad politicians . 
4182	1177	Do we need ranting idiots like ASPECT_GRAYSON using pols . 
4182	1177	franking privilege to spend 75,000,000.00 to mail out re-election cd on we dollar . 
4183	1177	Not on grayson campaign money , we tax money . 
4184	1178	What we need is to get lawyers out of govt altogether . 
4187	1179	People who lose unemployment benefits are STILL counted as unemployed so long as PEOPLE are still looking for work . 
4188	1179	How times do I have to say NO ? 
4189	1179	You quoted link proves yourself wrong . 
4190	1179	Seriously ... SOURCE takes motion of one index finger and little reading time to learn and you still refuse to do so ! 
4191	1179	I posted link . 
4192	1179	I was told SOURCE was BS source . 
4193	1179	I reiterated link can not be BS source because source is straight from horse mouth . 
4194	1179	ASPECT_BLS is responsible for counting unemployment . 
4195	1179	I was still told I was wrong . 
4196	1179	So I posted link again and copyed and pasted section proves I right . 
4197	1179	Since you STILL can not read after going to section SECTION proves I right I will now copy and past PARAGRAPH proves I right . 
4198	1179	If you ca n't even read paragraph then you really do n't belong on forum . 
4200	1180	You just posted link about ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_BIRTH_CERTIFICATE I proved was BS ... ASPECT_DOUBLE_STANDARD ? 
4201	1181	Great point , I have trading Acc . 
4202	1181	I wish I had 25 gain in ! 
4203	1182	Then what is motivating you to be racist ? 
4204	1182	Oh , 's right , you are n't , you just sound racist . 
4206	1182	conservatives are racist , even though CONSERVATIVES do n't claim to be Republican . 
4207	1182	Like ASPECT_RON_PAUL , ASPECT_PAUL claims to be Independent , but runs on ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_TICKET ? 
4208	1182	INDEPENDENT would be nice to replace incumbents from both parties with impartial , unbiased , non-racist incumbents , but soon you find that even ones calling incumbents independents have ONES own special warts . 
4209	1182	And extremes on both sides are insane and out of touch with reality , but recently ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY has grown whole slew of INCUMBENTS , INCUMBENTS call INCUMBENTS `` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY ! 
4210	1183	ASPECT_BIRTHERS will never accept ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_BIRTH_CERTIFICATE , no matter how official and authentic certificate is . 
4211	1183	's your problem not ASPECT_OBAMA . 
4212	1184	Seems to me Reps flip-flop on what they want . 
4213	1184	Not to long ago ASPECT_PALIN and ASPECT_MCCAIN were both for cap and trade , now THEY are against CAP ! 
4214	1184	Is that with you ? 
4215	1184	If ASPECT_MCCAIN had won , you 'd be for , right ? 
4216	1184	ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN Flip-Flop on cap-and-tradeposted by cloe ON July 20 , 2009 AT 08:01 pmsince ASPECT_SARAH ASPECT_PALIN announced that she d be resigning she post as ASPECT_ALASKA s governor -LRB- 16 month early -RRB- couple of weeks ago , ON s made FLIP-FLOP clear ON plans to spend time traveling around lower 48 states . 
4217	1184	True to task , on Tuesday palin had oped in ASPECT_WASHINGTON post articulating opposition to ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA s energy plan which includes cap-and-trade program would allow industrial sources to buy and sell pollution permits . 
4218	1184	But TUESDAY looks like s little unclear on what policy positions are . 
4219	1184	During campaign , mccain-palin campaign literature -LRB- check CAMPAIGN out below -rrb- and candidate -LRB- see video -RRB- sang totally different tune . 
4220	1184	THEN : They -LRB- ASPECT_MCCAIN-PALIN -RRB- have proposed cap-and-trade system would reduce greenhouse gas emissions while encouraging development of low-cost compliance options . 
4221	1184	climate cap-and-trade mechanism would set limit on greenhouse gas emissions and allow entities to buy and sell rights to emit , similar to successful acid rain trading program of early 1990s . 
4222	1184	feature of mechanism is that FEATURE allows market to decide and encourage lowest-cost compliance options . 
4223	1184	NOW : ASPECT_PALIN wants to responsibly tap resources that God created right underfoot on ASPECT_AMERICAN soil and drill in pristine arctic national wildlife refuge . 
4225	1185	ASPECT_DOUBLE_STANDARD ? 
4226	1185	birther arguement has been proven beyond doubt to be false . 
4227	1185	No court in country has even accepted birther case because they are so mind numbingly void of evidence . 
4228	1186	What you liberals interpret as `` extremes are everyone does not share your beautiful and fine sounding but impossible utopian dreams . 
4229	1186	`` Everything for Everybody , would be end result for liberals . 
4230	1186	Well certainly RESULT would be wonderful if everyone was free from want and need and work . 
4231	1186	But is not impossible , RESULT is impossible in `` extreme . 
4232	1186	`` And ASPECT_TEA_PARTY IS ASPECT_AMERICAN silent majority finding result voice . 
4234	1186	ca n't understand and reject ASPECT_SIMPLE_TRUTH . 
4235	1186	IS ` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY ' mixed bag ? 
4236	1186	Certainly AMERICA is , ASPECT_AMERICA ASPECT_AMERICA . 
4237	1186	Standing up for values instead of ` dreaming impossible dreams . 
4238	1186	`` Should libs FEAR Silent Majority ? 
4239	1186	Oh very YES . 
4240	1186	Not for violence , but because YES means end of liberalism and progressiveness . 
4241	1186	And will re-establish idea of rewards for hard work and accomplishment instead of rewarding mediocrity and abject whining . 
4242	1186	Out of touch with reality ? 
4243	1186	ASPECT_MISSOURI voted 71 &#37; against obummercare . 
4244	1186	ASPECT_GIBBS said , to paraphrase , `` doan mean nuttin . 
4245	1186	was what was said in ASPECT_VIETNAM to avoid reality . 
4246	1186	ASPECT_REID said . 
4247	1186	people learn about ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL , better people like ASPECT_BILL . 
4248	1186	is BOTH untrue and out of touch with reality . 
4249	1186	So gibbs and reid are both out of touch with reality or both intentional liars . 
4250	1186	And likely both are Both . 
4251	1186	And Gallup , not ASPECT_FOX , not ASPECT_RASMUSSEN , now has obummer approval at 41 for vs 57 against . 
4252	1186	2 points on ASPECT_BO consistent and constant ASPECT_DOWNWARD_SPIRAL and we break into 30 . 
4253	1186	Wonder how dems will ask for ASPECT_BO campaign help when ASPECT_BO 's in 30 ?? 
4254	1186	They 'll be `` BUSY , when ASPECT_BO comes to town . 
4255	1186	6.00 plate fund raiser at ASPECT_BURGER_KING is not far off . 
4256	1187	You find self serving piece on DEMOCRATS.ORG . 
4258	1187	How credence would you put in article from ASPECT_REPUBLICAN party website ?? 
4259	1187	Way less than zero I would imagine . 
4260	1187	And ASPECT_SNOPES does not back up article . 
4261	1187	Shall we link from ASPECT_BREITBART to condemn libs ? 
4262	1187	Or use as neutral standing sites as possible ? 
4263	1188	If you want to have fun with morons post links to communist party usa web site and ASPECT_OBAMA agenda , or dnc platform etc. ... . 
4264	1188	and see if MORONS can find differences . 
4265	1189	Errr what ? 
4266	1190	lol wow ... 
4267	1192	I dont like ASPECT_MCCAIN hes to liberal for I and you are right mccain does flip flop hes typical , out for mccain politician . 
4268	1192	I hate hidden forms of taxes like crap and trade ! 
4269	1194	Sure there has been change . 
4270	1194	Spending is even more out of control , 3 times . 
4271	1194	And of useless and unwanted and unworkable laws have been rammed through using parliamentary tricks , bribes , and coercion and 100 partisan politics . 
4272	1194	whole world now thinks ASPECT_USA is silly joke instead of international leader . 
4273	1194	Instead of listening to ASPECT_US , now world ignores ASPECT_US ASPECT_OR tells us what to do and how to act . 
4274	1194	Plenty of change , just NONE good . 
4275	1195	WEALTH 've already asked if there is difference between idea of `` redistribute wealth . 
4276	1195	mantra of B.O. And tenet of , `` From according to AND ability , To according to ASPECT_B.O. need . 
4277	1195	basic plank in Communist platform . 
4278	1195	two statements are identical in meaning . 
4279	1196	I do n't have issue with communist motto `` From according to EACH ability to according to EACH need sounds like good way to form ASPECT_TAX_POLICY . 
4280	1196	Give to neediest . 
4281	1196	wrong with . 
4282	1196	But if you believe to be representative of Communist platform you are sorely mistaken . 
4283	1196	about ASPECT_OBAMA and democrat platform even remotely resembles communism . 
4284	1196	You could not be further from truth on aspect . 
4285	1198	Your absolute foolish and naive post to date . 
4286	1198	is scary in misguided innocence and horrific in inherent dangers . 
4287	1199	Are you going to tell me there is wrong with ASPECT_TAX_MONEY going to people who need assistance ? 
4288	1199	Especially in bad recession ? 
4289	1199	Because economist agrees that best way to get out of recession fast -LRB- especially in one where consumer demand is low -RRB- is to shift wealth to poor as fast as possible to get money flowing again . 
4290	1199	people who are foolish are who believe otherwise . 
4291	1200	What bunch of BS . 
4292	1200	You 'll have to prove that one . 
4293	1201	I would think proof would be in fact that largest economic crash since great depression -LRB- and probably even larger than -RRB- was quickly ended less than year after ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL . 
4294	1202	Giving unearned money to poor and to people hurt by recession are two different things . 
4295	1202	People who are down on POOR luck , out of job , due to no fault of POOR deserve help . 
4296	1202	People who are lazy and do not try to look for work are whole different story . 
4297	1202	Just saying give money to poor will stimulate economy is incorrect . 
4298	1202	How of lazy will spend money on drugs ? 
4299	1202	Want to spend money on lazy ? 
4300	1202	Take old proverb into reality , instead of giving man food fish to eat day , teach him to fish and him can provide for HIM for ever . 
4301	1202	-LRB- maybe not exact , but WE should get point -RRB- If we just continually give , people have initiative to become asset to Country . 
4303	1202	If BO just gave 110 million taxpayers equal cut of trillions bo has spent in 19 months , how much would everyone have to invest into economy , makes lot sense than than re-distributing wealth to non-supporters of of CountryBack to OP , I would not vote for BO in million years ... . 
4304	1203	Please post link to economist to prove your assertion . 
4305	1204	Fortunately is not case for people on welfare or ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP . 
4306	1204	70 of who get on welfare return to work eventually . 
4307	1204	And average time off work for on welfare is 3 years . 
4308	1204	combination of welfare and foodstamps average recipient recieves is not enough to put yourself above poverty line . 
4309	1204	people if given choice are not going to want to continue living like . 
4310	1204	And do decide to are often taken off programs like unemployment benefits . 
4311	1204	Laziness is not problem with poor and ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS . 
4312	1204	poor are extremely hard working people who have not been given proper tools and education to succeed . 
4313	1204	AMOUNT 's not exorbident amount of money we 're giving PEOPLE . 
4314	1204	WE 're giving PEOPLE enough for food . 
4315	1204	WE 're giving PEOPLE enough to support family at bare minimum needs . 
4316	1204	And in cases we 're giving PEOPLE job . 
4317	1204	As I said before . 
4318	1204	people who get on welfare want more than to get off . 
4319	1204	STYLE below poverty line life style and STYLE no way to raise family or even live on your . 
4320	1204	No would n't make sense because there are people do not need ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY and would just put STYLE in people rainy day fund . 
4321	1204	big corporate leaders are n't going to use money to hire people since demand is so low NO does n't warrant hiring people . 
4322	1205	My post was in re : your wholehearted endorsement of Communism . 
4323	1205	Evidently Liberalism is now Communism for can not spell Communism . 
4324	1205	philosophies are . 
4325	1205	TAKE from who have , Give to who have not earned . 
4326	1205	As far as your post above and far attempt to change subject . 
4327	1205	can see extremely obvious fact that B.O. policies have NOT recovered economy even enough for ASPECT_JOB_CREATION to keep up with population growth . 
4328	1205	Are not foolish . 
4329	1205	Unemployment claims are up again . 
4330	1205	There was little drop for weeks but now DROP on rise again . 
4331	1205	AND ASPECT_BLS once again said that rate maintained at 9.5 because another 187,000 formerly unemployed , exhausted UNEMPLOYED benefits and dropped out of labor market . 
4332	1205	Not my words , or ASPECT_RNC words or Rush words , comes straight from ASPECT_BLS . 
4333	1205	Is economy better ? 
4334	1205	Yes ECONOMY is very MARGINALLY better . 
4335	1205	obummer and Stimulus ? 
4336	1205	No , could be reason for minuscule improvement . 
4337	1205	And trying to claim that NO `` enlightened policies resulted in but invisible improvement IS FOOLISH . 
4338	1205	Wonder if ASPECT_ROEMER , roemer main economic adviser quit or was FIRED week . 
4339	1205	really intelligent person in charge would NOT be trying to take credit for little results of massive spending . 
4340	1205	Give obummer credit for jobs person CLAIMS to have `` Created and WONDER works out to over half million dollars per job . 
4341	1205	At rate , ROBUST economy will cost us Quadrillions , not Trillions . 
4342	1205	Great economy , impoverished country . 
4343	1205	Not gain . 
4344	1205	and , day by day , population of ASPECT_USA is realizing that obum is completely mired in purely ideological agendas have to do with responsibility of Governing . 
4345	1205	DREAMER is incompetent dreamer or worse . 
4346	1206	I think there 's difference , mainly in scale . 
4347	1206	Even ASPECT_ADAM ASPECT_SMITH advocated `` redistributing wealth in form of progressive tax structure . 
4348	1206	federal tax bracket is lowest bracket been in decades . 
4349	1206	main idea behind Communism , in theory , was to provide ASPECT_ECONOMIC_EQUALITY because of huge amount of inequality that ASPECT_MARX witnessed . 
4350	1206	way to do in existing system of government is to not tax lower classes and tax upper class 100 , caps on income , etc. . 
4351	1206	I do n't see anything like coming from ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION . 
4352	1207	Your inability to see obvious is not subject . 
4353	1207	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_EQUALITY is oxymoron . 
4354	1207	have ability to become wealthy , do not . 
4355	1207	We have equality of opportunity . 
4356	1207	have opportunity to make attempt at wealth . 
4357	1207	wealth can not be given to have not and can not earn CAN . 
4358	1207	Money can be given to and Trillions have been . 
4359	1207	waste CAN one way or another . 
4360	1207	you take from wealthy , more you damage everyone , including poor . 
4361	1207	NO wealthy person has WEALTHY stack of money locked in vault . 
4362	1207	money is always in action in economy . 
4363	1207	Invigorating economy and creating jobs , NOT sitting and shrinking from inflation . 
4364	1207	IS way ECONOMY can grow . 
4365	1207	And benefits poor MORE than giving them dollars to be wasted . 
4366	1207	ASPECT_BHO has incredible blessing of historical timing . 
4367	1207	ASPECT_BHO has done of note with bho life before or after being elected to ASPECT_POLITICAL_OFFICE , including present position . 
4368	1207	was do state rep. do federal senator , and now do -LRB- good -RRB- president . 
4369	1207	But came from nowhere in 2008 in political vacuum . 
4370	1207	And now timing blesses A again with unusually low inflation . 
4371	1207	Notice that no lib . 
4372	1207	is blaming ASPECT_BUSH for . 
4373	1207	Inflation is very low , artificially low . 
4374	1207	If we were running even normal inflation rates , calls for impeachment would already have been heard . 
4375	1207	BO failed ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY does not show up as bad as they are , due to very low inflation . 
4376	1207	ASPECT_BHO has had political luck and blessing than politician in 100 years . 
4377	1207	BHO has no skills for governing , just luck . 
4378	1207	ASPECT_BHO has wasted bit of LUCK . 
4379	1208	And how does of relate to your claim that `` redistribution of wealth and `` From according to from ability , to according to from need is ? 
4380	1209	I do n't recall endorsing communism . 
4381	1210	Liberals do n't recognize history . 
4382	1210	Everybody knows that . 
4383	1211	Again , how is relevant to anything ? 
4384	1211	Throwing out ASPECT_RANDOM_BIT of nonsense wo n't get you anywhere . 
4385	1212	ASPECT_RANDOM_BIT of nonsense ? 
4386	1212	I can not argue with expert in field . 
4387	1212	And liberals are experts at ASPECT_RANDOM_BIT of nonsense . 
4388	1212	But pendulum is swinging away from utter nonsense of liberalism and back to logic of conservatism . 
4389	1212	PENDULUM will take years but your day in sun is ending . 
4390	1212	Once again accomplishments will be rewarded and there will be no rewards for being parasite on society . 
4391	1212	If one accomplishments are meager , so then will rewards be equally meager . 
4392	1213	Using fallacious arguments over and over and over again would n't exactly ensure that you are above using nonsense , and arrogantly trying to portray that I do as , even though , out of two of us , I 'm one even attempting to further discuss topic at hand . 
4393	1213	I 'm terribly sorry that you ca n't manage to support your position , but POSITION no reason to be unnecessarily antagonistic . 
4394	1214	reality of country around us supports my position perfectly and completely negates yours . 
4395	1214	MY have no need to prove obvious while you have no possibility of disproving ridiculousness of liberalism . 
4396	1214	NEED is what need is . 
4397	1214	Liberals have had LIBERALS run most all of 20th century . 
4398	1214	RUN did n't work . 
4399	1214	Your time is gone . 
4400	1214	transition will take bit but transition is time for liberals to fade into background . 
4401	1214	Sadly at time in future , pendulum will swing back your way . 
4402	1214	MY 'll be gone . 
4404	1215	You 've been watching Faux news too long . 
4405	1216	Conservatives keep rewriting history , everybody knows that . 
4406	1217	Sigh , shifting wealth ... again , how is correct , responsible , and ethical ? 
4407	1217	Oh wait SIGH not . 
4408	1217	You are TAKING from one to give to another did . 
4409	1218	Yeah like ASPECT_CLINTON mythical Budget surplus that Democrat never fails to mention . 
4410	1218	What they do not mention is that ASPECT_CLINTON cooperated with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS to come close to balancing budget . 
4411	1218	And in no fiscal year of ASPECT_CLINTON Presidency did ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT come down . 
4412	1218	went up year ! 
4413	1218	Altho in small amounts that we would love to have today . 
4414	1218	But spending was NEVER so controlled that interest on debt did not cause debt to increase . 
4415	1218	Interest IS part of problem and must be counted same as reckless spending . 
4416	1218	But again kudos to ASPECT_CLINTON and Republicans for as well as they did . 
4417	1218	We could use that cooperation today . 
4418	1218	Just one small example of true history that dems and libs seem to get wrong constantly . 
4419	1219	You 're being charged to live in one of greatest countries in ASPECT_AMERICA . 
4420	1219	ONE way to pay for freedom 's fair . 
4421	1220	And how much are Takers being charged and by whom . 
4422	1220	HALF of `` greatest country gets while half gives . 
4423	1220	And you profess is Right ??? 
4424	1221	Part of living in great country means if proper channels are filed no one should ever starve in country . 
4425	1221	You might be giving right now . 
4426	1221	But if God forbid you fall into situation where you ca n't afford food longer you will be thankful to be in country where you can get tax assistance as well . 
4427	1221	I 'm sorry you 'd rather live in country where we allow people to starve because of people financial situation . 
4428	1221	But thankfully we are land of freedom . 
4429	1221	Not greed . 
4430	1222	As always liberal utopian dreams sound beautiful , but they DO NOT stand up to reality . 
4431	1222	HALF country ARE parasites living quite well off half are responsible hard working citizens . 
4432	1222	And of half are parasites , LESS than 10 &#37; approach anything could be called poverty . 
4433	1222	And tiny percentage ever go to bed HUNGRY . 
4434	1222	are over nourished on junk food and grossly fat ! 
4435	1222	Starving is nearly NON-EXISTENT in country . 
4436	1222	Freeloading is life career for half country . 
4437	1222	, is reason I object . 
4439	1223	So you being on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP or ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD -LRB- I forget which one you are on -RRB- , while I work 2 jobs to pay for I college , etc. . 
4441	1223	is ok , while you do n't have job . 
4442	1223	How is fair again ? 
4443	1224	It 's fair because A. I 'm probably in lot debt . 
4444	1224	And B. You can probably afford things . 
4445	1224	And C. If ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD did n't exist I can all but guarantee you would not have your 2 jobs right now in economy . 
4446	1224	And if you did C. would be for lot less money . 
4447	1224	And d. even working 2 jobs could get ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD if they wanted to and they make less than required money . 
4448	1224	I suggest you stop whining and apply . 
4449	1224	D. 'll make your life easier and D. will benefit economy . 
4450	1224	I roommate has 3 jobs and 's not enough for ROOMMATE to be able to afford rent because ROOMMATE also cares for roommate parents . 
4451	1224	ROOMMATE qualify for ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP as well . 
4452	1224	Here you can do 3 online ! 
4454	1225	1 -RRB- Said he was against middle eastern war , said that HE would start pulling troops out at beginning , instead HE sent than ASPECT_BUSH did -LRB- fact -rrb- . 
4455	1225	HE said HE was against Patriot act but voted for act .2 -RRB- In he healthcare bill , HE used backdoor meetings to secure votes by unions etc. . 
4456	1225	bill ACT was changed multiple times before republicans could properly read BILL , and democrats as well .3 -RRB- Is going to let ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT expire , which is going to increase taxes . 
4457	1225	ASPECT_BUSH administration has announced ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE due to ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_BILL , and for everyone . 
4458	1225	REPUBLICANS are purposing to add vat tax while not eliminating others -LRB- increase of taxes -RRB- .4 -RRB- ASPECT_BUSH has spent money in 2 years than ASPECT_BUSH did in 8.5 -RRB- Used ASPECT_BUSH position of BUSH politicl party to strong ASPECT_ARM_OBAMA_CARE through before congress had even read INCREASE , before of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE had read INCREASE and despite strong resistance from country .6 -RRB- Instead of supporting country sovereignty , ASPECT_BUSH choses to sue state takes matters that ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT is obligated to do as ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT . 
4460	1225	Bottom line , there is WAY better out there , LINE doesnt matter if line 2 years in , there is way better . 
4461	1228	So how is your decision to make debt for yourself defense ? 
4462	1229	You think CHOICE my choice to be in debt ? 
4463	1229	If MY could handle 2 jobs and college my would . 
4464	1229	But MY ca n't . 
4465	1229	Kudos to can . 
4466	1229	But MY ca n't . 
4467	1229	School has never been easy for MY . 
4468	1229	And my grades drop to unacceptable levels when MY have work . 
4469	1229	's why MY work summer jobs . 
4470	1229	His ability to work 2 jobs while going to school is great . 
4471	1229	HIS will see greater financial rewards than MY will as result . 
4472	1229	's what is fair about RESULT . 
4473	1229	HIS hard work pays off in end . 
4474	1229	Where as MY will have to work harder later to pay off my debts . 
4475	1229	But HIS would rather MY choice be between starving or flunking school . 
4477	1229	MY am glad country is not greedy cesspool country HIS wants COUNTRY to be . 
4478	1229	MY 'm glad have freedom to go to school without worrying too about financial needs . 
4479	1230	Are you incapable of thinking in term ? 
4480	1231	banks were bailed out before ASPECT_BUSH was elected . 
4481	1231	was ASPECT_BUSH . 
4482	1231	And you better thank your lucky stars ASPECT_BUSH did . 
4483	1231	Or we 'd be in depression . 
4484	1232	He said HE was against ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR . 
4485	1232	HE has shrunk of troops in ASPECT_IRAQ . 
4486	1232	HE said HE was for ASPECT_AFGHAN_WAR . 
4487	1232	HE has increased amount of troops in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN and ASPECT_PAKISTAN . 
4488	1232	HE has done with troop levels contradicts what HE campaigned on . 
4489	1232	ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_BILL was passed through perfectly legal passages . 
4490	1232	And unions did not vote on issue . 
4491	1232	peoples taxes have gone down . 
4492	1232	's fact . 
4493	1232	lol not at true . 
4494	1232	ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_BILL was in ASPECT_CONGRESS for than 8 months . 
4495	1232	If your republican leaders ca n't read bill in 8 months you really have to wonder why LEADERS are your leaders . 
4496	1232	LEADERS crossed line of LEADERS constitutional powers as state . 
4497	1232	LEADERS deserve law suit against LEADERS . 
4499	1235	Are you incapable for comprehending question ? 
4500	1235	point is that if POINT is not to be started in 2014 , why does POINT need to be passed in 2010 ? 
4501	1235	If POINT for purpose of collecting taxes for 4 years to kick start benefits in 2014 then POINT completely flawed idea . 
4502	1235	Give ASPECT_TAX_MONEY for 4 years , so YEARS will build up , so they can provide you ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE ? 
4503	1235	uneducated people will understand . 
4504	1236	How does contradict what or ASPECT_OBAMA said . 
4505	1236	ASPECT_OBAMA campaigned on increasing troops on ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN . 
4506	1236	It was one of his campaign promises to increase troops in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN . 
4507	1236	ASPECT_LABOR_UNION did not vote for bill . 
4508	1236	Congressmen and women did . 
4509	1236	Your source is opinion piece that right from get go states PIECE bias against liberal politicians . 
4510	1236	Which apparently politicians think ASPECT_OBAMA is ... even though ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICY are pretty far from liberal . 
4512	1236	ASPECT_BUSH spent in 8 years than ASPECT_OBAMA spent in 2 . 
4513	1236	was your claim . 
4514	1236	HUNDREDS are STILL spending hundreds of billions in unjustified and unnecessary war in ASPECT_IRAQ that ASPECT_BUSH started . 
4515	1236	ASPECT_OBAMA has no power to do . 
4516	1236	Please read basic civics book and learn powers of branches of government before complaining about what ASPECT_OBAMA did . 
4517	1236	Your `` research is but opinion articles that fit your view of world . 
4518	1236	do n't think you understand what research is . 
4519	1236	Research is raw numbers and data . 
4520	1236	saw no budget charts . 
4521	1236	saw no evidence to back of your claims . 
4522	1236	you provided is that there is on internet agrees with you . 
4523	1236	Not difficult to do . 
4524	1237	I have 3 saudi-arabian exchange students that live door to I . 
4525	1237	I am good friends with STUDENTS . 
4526	1237	friends government gives friends plenty of money since FRIENDS government actually values education unlike ours . 
4527	1237	FRIENDS can live very comfortably without working . 
4528	1237	If FRIENDS do n't put up grades , FRIENDS get sent back home . 
4529	1237	friends system of education works much better than OURS . 
4530	1237	Do n't talk to I about going to college without having to worry to about financial needs . 
4531	1237	Hell yes I am worried about money while in college and you should be too . 
4532	1237	's why I am working 2 jobs and transferring to local university , so I can save money . 
4533	1237	Maybe you should consider . 
4534	1237	Also , both I jobs would be there if HELL was n't for criminal redistribution of wealth by food stamps\/bridge programs . 
4535	1237	Bottom line , YOU country does next to to value education . 
4536	1237	's why LINE outrageously expensive . 
4537	1237	You ca n't get -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- for loans unless your parents are poor or MINORITY are minority . 
4538	1238	agreed angry conservatives whining about working hard , pick fruit from obamas tree and settle down . 
4539	1238	FRUIT helps economy and makes life easier 
4540	1239	Everyone qualifies for obamas assistance including whites , maybe if conservatives research WHITES will be better able to get educated . 
4541	1239	Recent data shows students going to college are on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP and type of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE , with low income qualifies for COLLEGE . 
4542	1239	Vote for ASPECT_OBAMA and democrats to help yourselves . 
4543	1240	ASPECT_OBAMA just took over college loan system to pay for ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE , which means government will no longer have competition for loans . 
4544	1240	Which means stupidly high rate loans to take out . 
4545	1240	middle class whites receive other than -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- un-subsidized loans . 
4546	1240	I doubt you know what is though . 
4547	1240	Also , where is recent data shows ? 
4548	1240	I 'm in college , people are not on ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE other than loans . 
4549	1240	I will never vote for ASPECT_OBAMA either . 
4550	1241	I work hard . 
4551	1241	people whining are people taking ASPECT_MY_MONEY . 
4552	1241	Do n't bite hand feeds . 
4553	1241	Of course YOU would criticize people for working hard . 
4554	1241	YOU would tell I to not work hard and let government provide for I . 
4555	1241	People not working helps economy ?! 
4556	1241	You got one right ... makes your life easier . 
4557	1241	I am just in awe at how lazy people are . 
4558	1241	I 'm not going to work so I will just let taxpayers pay for I meals . 
4559	1242	middle class whites do n't need taxpayer loans , WHITES live with whites parents . 
4560	1242	ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_LOAN are given to independent students who make WHITES way , are people that need extra help with ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP and ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE . 
4561	1243	bridge program allows for working poor people to get food stamps and assistance because PEOPLE do n't live with ASPECT_PEOPLE_PARENT and actually have rent to pay along with people expenses . 
4562	1244	Go ahead and try to support premise . 
4565	1245	Where does obama get money ? 
4566	1246	Is clustered package of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_IDEA better than clustered package of democratic ideas ? 
4567	1246	Not if one of ideas includes ASPECT_TAX_BREAK to rich ... 
4568	1247	Generally ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_LOAN are cheaper rates because they are partially paid for by ASPECT_TAX_PAYER . 
4569	1247	YOU consider YOU family middle class . 
4570	1247	YOU parents make about 40-50k year . 
4571	1247	YOU got tons of subsidized loans . 
4572	1247	YOU think you 'd be surprised . 
4573	1247	4 of YOU room mates are on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP . 
4574	1247	members of YOU apartment complex YOU 've spoken to are on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP . 
4575	1247	And quite of YOU friends are as well . 
4576	1247	And YOU 've been nudging people to get ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP as well . 
4577	1247	COMPLEX just makes things easier . 
4578	1247	Even you ... with 2 jobs ... could qualify for ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP . 
4579	1247	If you make less than 1000 month then chances are you qualify for full benefit of 200 month . 
4580	1247	Which is more than enough to eat and eat healthy . 
4581	1247	YOU highly suggest you take opportunity to sign up . 
4582	1247	Think of OPPORTUNITY as taking of your ASPECT_TAX_MONEY back . 
4584	1248	Newsflah : We 're still in recession . 
4585	1249	Dems were incapable of reading apparently . 
4586	1250	It is amazing that you know so little about ASPECT_UNITED_STATE that you could type above and believe of TYPE is good . 
4587	1250	true american understands how ASPECT_AMERICA MUST function knows that one must try to fix themselves AND try to help THEMSELVES country , NOT way around . 
4588	1250	Your way MUST FAIL . 
4589	1250	thr right way was clearly stated by Democrat . 
4591	1250	ASPECT_JFK said , `` Ask NOT what your country can do for YOUR , ASK what YOUR can do for your country ! 
4592	1250	`` Instead of recommending others to ALSO become freeloaders , LOSER should be condemning idea of taking anything from Government unless LOSER need is dire . 
4593	1250	And needing another color tv and high speed internet connection are not dire needs for person on planet . 
4594	1250	Not one . 
4595	1250	country and economy are only benefited when of us contribute . 
4596	1250	2 people spending one person money does NOT put single penny more into economy . 
4597	1250	It just means hard worker has less and freeloader has more . 
4598	1250	When ASPECT_JFK went to college jfk was married , had 2 baby sons , worked ASPECT_FULL_TIME_JOB , and carried full load of credits , and still found time to do Friday beer night with frat brothers twice month . 
4599	1250	Where energy came from ASPECT_JFK do n't remember -LRB- wish JFK had energy now -RRB- . 
4600	1250	Grades were good , not spectacular but good . 
4601	1250	No ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP , no welfare , no help from anywhere including parents . 
4602	1250	Who would have been happy to help , but what were doing was what chose to do and if could not do HELP on , HELP was on . 
4603	1250	JFK would have been ASHAMED to even think about ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_MONEY . 
4604	1250	Taking ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_MONEY means that LOSER are loser and parasite on society . 
4605	1250	! 
4606	1251	No we are n't 
4607	1252	Sure we are . 
4608	1252	wikipediain economics , recession is business cycle contraction , general slowdown in ASPECT_ECONOMIC_ACTIVITY over period of time . 
4609	1252	-LRB- 1 -RRB- -LRB- 2 -RRB- During recessions , macroeconomic indicators vary in similar way . 
4610	1252	Production as measured by Gross domestic product -LRB- gdp -rrb- , employment , investment spending , capacity utilization , household incomes , business profits and inflation fall during recessions ; while bankruptcies and unemployment rate rise . 
4611	1252	Recessions are generally believed to be caused by widespread drop in spending . 
4612	1252	Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies , such as increasing money supply , increasing ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING and decreasing taxation . 
4613	1252	and DOWNTURN could be truthfully argued that we 're in depression : wikipediadepressionin economics , depression is sustained , long-term downturn in ASPECT_ECONOMIC_ACTIVITY in one or economies . 
4614	1252	DOWNTURN is severe downturn than recession , which is seen by economists as part of normal ASPECT_BUSINESS_CYCLE . 
4615	1252	Considered rare and extreme form of recession , depression is characterized by form length , and by abnormally increases in unemployment , falls in availability of credit quite often due to kind of banking\/financial crisis , shrinking output and investment , numerous bankruptcies including sovereign debt defaults , significantly reduced amounts of trade and commerce especially international , as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations most often due to devaluations . 
4616	1252	price deflation , financial crises and ASPECT_BANK_FAILURE are also common elements of depression . 
4617	1252	Of course government will tell you that everything is great and we 're doing just fine and indicators show that WE 're pulling out of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AND of measures have worked and ... blah blah ... etc. . 
4619	1252	lies ... etc. . 
4620	1253	Wikipedia is not good source . 
4621	1253	definition of recession is 2 consecutive quarters of economic decline . 
4622	1253	We 've been experiencing ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH . 
4623	1253	And everything is n't fine and government is n't claiming that . 
4624	1253	WE are in very early stages of recovery and facing possibility of double dip recession . 
4625	1253	No one is claiming WE are in good position . 
4626	1253	But WE are n't by means in recession . 
4627	1253	recession ended officially early year . 
4628	1254	yes wiki is n't good source for things . 
4629	1254	definition , however , is n't negotiable . 
4630	1254	economy has expanded miniscule amount . 
4632	1254	but no. . 
4633	1254	NO. has n't begun to climb back anywhere near where NO. was . 
4634	1254	's government spin to claim no. is now growing . 
4635	1254	's like team ca n't stop pass giving up 500 yards in air and then bragging `` look we held them to 10 yards rushing . 
4637	1254	. 
4637	1254	deception . 
4639	1254	. 
4639	1254	's like saying if we had n't given away 700 billion dollars economy would REALLY be bad right now . 
4640	1254	WE saved . 
4640	1254	! 
4641	1254	... hahahah . 
4645	1254	What parts of definitions of `` depression and `` recession are wrong ? 
4646	1254	They look pretty solid to me . 
4647	1255	OK , here is non political dictionary version . 
4648	1255	re &#183; ces &#183; sion 1 -LRB- r-sshn -rrb- n. 1 .

4654	1255	depression -LRB- d &#618; &#712; pr &#603; &#643; &#601; -RRB- 5 . 
4655	1255	-LRB- Economics -RRB- economic condition characterized by substantial and protracted unemployment , low output and investment , etc. ; slumpRegardless of what label puts on CONDITION , economy is not good . 
4656	1255	`` advertised rate of unemployment of 9.5 &#37; and rate closer to 20 ! 
4657	1256	You 've got it wrong . 
4658	1256	It is good that you work hard , and you should expect government to recognize that , instead of taking your money and giving MONEY to very wealthy , who do n't work at . 
4659	1256	GOVERNMENT is known as corporate welfare , and amount of welfare spent on poor is drop in bucket compared to amount spent on wealthy . 
4660	1256	Yet ASPECT_GOP has convinced gop members that poor people suck money out of government . 
4661	1256	Corporate welfare-the enormous and myriad subsidies , bailouts , giveaways , tax loopholes , debt revocations , loan guarantees , discounted insurance and benefits conferred by government on business-is function of political corruption . 
4662	1256	Corporate welfare programs siphon funds from appropriate public investments , subsidize companies ripping minerals from federal lands , enable pharmaceutical companies to gouge consumers , perpetuate anti-competitive oligopolistic markets , injure ASPECT_NATIONAL_SECURITY , and weaken democracy . 
4663	1256	At time when national gdp is soaring , one in five children lives in deep poverty , one might expect that public effort to curtail welfare would focus on cutting big handouts to rich corporations , not small supports for poor individuals . 
4664	1256	But invocations of need for stand-on-your-own-two-feet responsibility do not apply to corporations . 
4665	1256	At time when even growing federal budget surpluses do not persuade nation ASPECT_POLITICAL_LEADER to devote public resources to repairing and enhancing built elements of commonwealth-such as nation schools , bridges , clinics , roads , drinking water systems , courthouses , public transportation systems , and water treatment facilities-one might expect to see calls to divert taxpayer monies from flowing into private corporate hands and instead direct leaders to crying public needs . 
4666	1256	But somehow cramped federal budget-as well as similarly situated state and local budgets-always has room for another corporate welfare program . 
4667	1256	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.thirdworldtraveler.com \ \/ na ... are ASPECT_NADER .

4668	1256	Even that work and claim people work hard . 
4669	1256	Too assume that people do n't work are lazy is just plain ignorance .

4672	1256	recession does n't play favorites . 
4673	1256	But to ignore poor people while allowing corporations -LRB- who pay people ceo big bonuses -RRB- , to continue and take advantage of ASPECT_AMERICANS is just plain wrong . 
4674	1257	And by definition we are NOT in recession .

4677	1258	-LRB- Economics -RRB- economic condition characterized by substantial and protracted unemployment , low output and investment , etc. ; slumpNot recession , but depression . 
4678	1258	substantial and protracted unemployment -- CHECK , we got . 
4679	1258	low output and investment , etc. -- CHECK , WE got . 
4680	1258	slump -- Check , yes obummer 's been in one since inauguration day . 
4681	1258	DEPRESSION , PLAIN AND SIMPLE . 
4682	1259	Depression is type of recession . 
4683	1259	So if we are n't recession then WE are n't depression . 
4685	1261	Chug that liberal kool-aid . 
4686	1261	B.O. blew TRILLION on trying to create jobs at about million bucks pop and ASPECT_B.O. did that because we are not even in recession ??? 
4687	1261	You ca n't see your contradictions ?? 
4688	1261	------------------------ everybody can . 
4689	1264	Call it what you want . 
4690	1264	economy , jobs , and ASPECT_HOUSING_MARKET suck . 
4691	1264	ASPECT_FED is also set to downgrade economic outlook for ASPECT_U.S. economy . 
4692	1265	It is so sad for you guys . 
4693	1265	ASPECT_BUSH is gone and ASPECT_BUSH is n't coming back . 
4694	1265	Sometime you WILL be able to see obummer IS spending 3 times faster than ASPECT_BUSH did . 
4695	1265	As bad as OBUMMER was , `` obamination , is much much worse . 
4696	1265	OBAMINATION am certain that when OBAMINATION is defeated or impeached , whichever comes first , liberal left is going to crucify OBAMINATION without mercy at all . 
4697	1265	FIRST will make conservative griping seem like love fest when liberals finally ca n't stand OBAMINATION anymore . 
4698	1265	AND AND IS HAPPENING NOW , NOW NOW ! 
4699	1266	conservatives have it hard through college because CONSERVATIVES make IT hard on CONSERVATIVES , either through ignorance of government help or pride not to ask for help . 
4700	1266	either way IT stupid . 
4701	1266	ask not what you can do for your government , but what your government can do for you . 
4702	1266	Vote obama 2012 
4703	1267	Spoken like true worthless freeloader wants to steal my money . 
4704	1267	Without ASPECT_MY_MONEY your giveaway government collapses into chaos . 
4705	1267	And you can only steal money from who earn MONEY for so and then stop you , from everything , because ARE both willing to work and you 're not , and actually are smarter than you . 
4706	1268	Completely not true . 
4707	1268	Please back up with link . 
4708	1268	There is also not one way I can claim independence or I would ... I could then go to college anywhere for free . 
4709	1268	If I parents give I , why do students from poor families whose parents give STUDENTS need ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP more than I ? 
4710	1268	Or free money for college ? 
4711	1268	I did n't live with I parents year , I had to pay for rent and food ... so way to assume . 
4712	1269	If they do n't pay for rent then its called independent and eligible for ASPECT_OBAMA_HELP , why post contradiction in post ? 
4713	1269	qualify for assistance but do n't apply , previous posters posted links start researching for government handouts . 
4714	1269	There out there for who need ITS , rich white people are paying for us . 
4715	1269	Vote obama 2012 
4716	1270	In of posts I 've ever seen you make , I do n't think I 've ever seen you post link to credible source , much less link at all . 
4717	1270	I mean , I guess is n't best place for PLACE , but PLACE late , I 'm little depressed , and I feel like finally telling you what I think . 
4718	1270	Your arguments are ignorant and fallacious , you never listen to logic , I mean , assuming you are n't conservative trying to make liberals look bad , PERSON are possibly ignorant person I have ever seen ! 
4719	1270	You are completely close minded , and it seems almost unreal that you can post over 3,000 posts on forum and your mind still be closed shell ! 
4720	1270	Your seeming utopia of world is incredibly flawed , and I think ASPECT_DEEP_INSIDE , you know UTOPIA . 
4721	1270	-LRB- is still assuming you are n't posing as liberal -rrb- . 
4722	1270	I am sorry , but YOU ARE WRONG ! 
4723	1270	I am not suprised that you are just into your 2nd bar of rep. \ \/ rantsorry mods , I just had to get off I chest . 
4724	1270	If you think I went overboard , feel free to edit\/delete BAR . 
4725	1270	I 'm going to bed . 
4726	1271	why was thread closed for trolling op ? 
4727	1272	Way to reply and deflect . 
4728	1273	Its apparently not open to people who have n't made up minds . 
4729	1274	right because no one changes minds in two years , or even cares who ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE is . 
4730	1274	THEY just make up THEY minds before hand and never change of THEY opinions ... THEY also do not know how to not have opinion and THEY know who THEY will vote for 2 years in advance . 
4731	1274	After 2 years mean anyway right ? 
4732	1274	, they `` change , nor do THEY have `` hope of anything new and good happening . 
4733	1274	Everything is just doomed to stay as is . 
4734	1274	There is no way anything good or bad could happen would change THEY opinions . 
4735	1274	Uncertainty is not option , maybe is not option . 
4736	1274	Either you sell two years short and give up and -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- guy or you praise GUY and buy into what hes saying . 
4737	1274	Either way poll fails as WAY usually not smart to be dead set on who your going to vote for till at least both candidates are announced , and of term is over . 
4738	1277	Sure it is . 
4739	1277	IT will be here when you make up your mind . 
4740	1278	... or , eight years of ASPECT_OBAMA may plunge us into depths of Hell . 
4741	1279	Possibly , but we wo n't see effects of of ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION_POLICY for years , and I 'd like to see how stimulus , change of war focus , bailouts , financial and health reform play out before changing horses in ASPECT_MIDSTREAM . 
4742	1279	WE had eight republican years and witnessed how things turned out , let give ASPECT_DEMOCRATS eight and compare . 
4743	1280	folks who dissect ASPECT_OBAMA policies see bad things happening . 
4744	1280	is why FOLKS want to change course - Administrations . 
4745	1280	Throwing and ASPECT_TAXPAYER_MONEY at problems will not make FOLKS go away . 
4746	1280	I 'm afraid we can not afford another ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM . 
4747	1281	Let not and say did , OK ?? 
4748	1281	had forty years straight of Democrat rule started whole pile of sh in place ! 
4749	1282	Who told you that ? 
4750	1282	Prior to ASPECT_OBAMA , we have had ASPECT_REPUBLICAN administrations for 20 out of past 28 years and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONTROL of ASPECT_CONGRESS for 14 of previous 16 . 
4751	1283	Whoever sits in oval office signs or does n't sign laws that ASPECT_CONGRESS -LRB- lawmaking body -rrb- passes . 
4752	1283	If President will not sign bill , ASPECT_CONGRESS has power to pass BILL anyway if they get enough members to vote to override veto . 
4753	1283	Now that you know or have been reminded of , Democrats HAVE BEEN in power for 4 years . 
4754	1283	Democrat controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS passed ASPECT_TARP , and Stimulus , and obummercare , and Financial regulation reform , and recent 26 Billion bailout of states wasted money . 
4755	1283	In 4 years THEY have jacked up ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT about 4,000,000,000,000.00 -LRB- 4 trillion -RRB- So is what THEY 've done in 4 of 8 years you want THEY to have . 
4756	1284	To override veto to pass law anyway requires 2\/3 vote in both houses of ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
4757	1284	Now that you know or have been reminded of , Democrats HAVE not had 2\/3 majority in of 4 years . 
4758	1284	Therefore , ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CONGRESS could not pass laws that Republicans opposed to address things like ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT that you conservatives are suddenly so concerned about . 
4759	1284	Where were you guys in 2001 while ASPECT_BUSH administration was squandering surplus with ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
4760	1284	Supporting deficits then . 
4761	1286	You need to research where Government actually gets government income tax revenue and stop reciting big liberal lie . 
4762	1286	rich will ALWAYS get richer . 
4763	1286	's how they got rich in place . 
4764	1286	Do n't worry about rich getting more . 
4765	1286	What THEY get THEY keep in play to make . 
4766	1286	ASPECT_TAX_CUT for lower ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS does . 
4767	1286	THEY do n't pay ASPECT_INCOME_TAX now . 
4768	1286	80 0 = 0 . 
4769	1286	Give THEY 50 ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
4770	1286	50 0 = 0 . 
4771	1286	Rounded off numbers : top 20 in income presently pays 85 of ASPECT_INCOME_TAX . 
4772	1286	30 in income pay remaining 15 bottom 50 in income do not pay ASPECT_INCOME_TAX . 
4773	1287	Raise top income tax level to about 50 . 
4774	1287	Close out loopholes . 
4775	1287	Cut payroll taxes 50 . 
4776	1287	reduces taxes lower middle classes pay and addresses your concerns . 
4777	1289	Do and what you get from rich will be not single penny more . 
4778	1289	Does spending 250,000.00 on tax lawyer to save million dollars on taxes sound like smart business move to you ? 
4779	1289	Well is what will happen . 
4780	1289	Then you have working rich . 
4781	1289	CREATORS are ASPECT_JOB_CREATOR . 
4782	1289	raise creators taxes and one of 2 things happen or both . 
4783	1289	One , CREATORS lay off people or raise prices that ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS has to pay for creators products or services , -- or both . 
4784	1289	Net to Govt . 
4785	1289	LESS , net to ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS , higher prices , fewer jobs . 
4786	1289	And rich , vested or working , are pound for pound about 5 or 6 times smarter than politicians . 
4787	1289	POLITICIANS win , 's how world works , like WORLD or not . 
4788	1289	action has equal and opposite reaction . 
4789	1289	State after state HAS raised taxes and netted much , less state income , unemployment , and higher prices . 
4790	1289	No example is better than ASPECT_NEW ASPECT_YORK . 
4791	1289	city and state . 
4792	1289	liberal answer is always raise taxes on rich and reality is that REALITY does NOT produce of desired results . 
4793	1289	And when one keeps doing over and over and expecting different results , is called what ? 
4794	1290	republicans\/conservatives pray for night ! 
4796	1290	ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA ratings are out of step with ASPECT_OBAMA achievementsa quick recollection of recent republican governance should make voters think twice about handing ASPECT_CONGRESS back to themAnd yet , we come back to great paradox of moment . 
4797	1290	reforms Democrats enact , less happy independent voters who , presumably , voted for Democrats because VOTERS wanted many of reforms enacted are . 
4798	1290	If discontent produces sort of `` enthusiasm gap at elections hinted at in recent polls , November could indeed see significant gains for ASPECT_GOP . 
4799	1290	said , my guess is gains wo n't be quite as large as pundits think , that much-anticipated rout wo n't actually occur . 
4800	1290	There are signs , in recent polls , that as election nears and people start paying attention to debates , voters are starting to return to Democrats . 
4801	1290	PEOPLE might detest incumbents , and , for variety of reasons , PEOPLE may feel increasingly disillusioned with ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION , but when push comes to shove voters also are n't convinced by gop message . 
4802	1290	Predictions are always dangerous game in politics , but at point MY guess is that ASPECT_DEMOCRATS will cling on to power , with significantly reduced majorities , in both houses of ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
4804	1291	It 's difficult to judge with ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY is to blame for mounting debt , as we keep voting in different parties to presidency and congress like yo-yo . 
4805	1291	WE 've got ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC president and democratically-controlled congress . 
4806	1291	Give we 70 + members in ASPECT_SENATE November so WE can see what happens without republican obstruction . 
4807	1291	I speculate planets will align and WE 'll have ASPECT_NEW_CAR from ASPECT_OPERA under we chairs . 
4808	1293	Hell no ! 
4809	1293	like asking me if ME want ASPECT_UNITED_STATE to fail ... ASPECT_JOLLEE 
4810	1294	Hell No ! 
4812	1294	Not if my life depended on LIFE ! 
4815	1296	WE DONT CARE what world thinks about us . 
4816	1296	ASPECT_US care about OURSELVES . 
4817	1296	He cares more about what you think being from new zealand than what I care about being from ASPECT_AMERICA . 
4818	1297	If you lived here and understood how his policies are affecting economy you may have different opinion ... BigBob 
4819	1298	Yes , yes . 
4820	1298	We know you do n't care . 
4821	1298	ARGUMENT is your argument for just about everything except your silly wars . 
4822	1298	But you might have to care that ASPECT_OBAMA wants to engage with world . 
4823	1298	After , WORLD will affect your your ability not to care . 
4824	1299	IDEA might be good idea to concern yourself with your territory , since you do not live here ... Instead of living vicariously through ASPECT_AMERICA ... Big bob 
4825	1300	We are ASPECT_UNITED_STATE of ASPECT_AMERICA , Is states we job to worry about your economy ? 
4826	1300	WE do alot of humanitarian assistance for countries , what does your country do ... WE cant give you everything , WE have to look out for we diverse nation of States ... JOB not we duty but in fact duty of your nation , if you have beef , change your laws , speak to people in charge of your country ... Do n't blame WE ... JOB not we job to support you ... Jollee 
4827	1301	Well done . 
4828	1301	In your eyes . 
4829	1302	And eyes of ... . 
4832	1303	Fighting against type of thinking is one of reasons I 'll vote for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
4833	1304	god bless ASPECT_AMERICA ! 
4834	1304	That you have ability to voice and act upon your prerogatives ... Unfortunately for you , your ideals are in minority ... Jollee 
4835	1305	God bless world ! 
4836	1305	Oh ... wait . 
4837	1306	Yes , I agree , I wish them well ... Jollee 
4838	1307	Who do you care about , ASPECT_AMERICA ... or world ? 
4839	1307	ASPECT_OBAMA cares more about world . 
4840	1307	is problem . 
4841	1307	OBAMA would rather have people in ASPECT_KENYA happy than people in ASPECT_AMERICA happy . 
4842	1307	God bless ASPECT_AMERICA ! 
4843	1308	I care about ASPECT_AMERICA mostly , because of world has indifference to freedom that we so embrace here in country ... I care about world , but WORLD is Dictators , political set-ups , etc. ... are hampering dictators prosperity ... Much like WE are experiencing now , but only for short period of time , I am thankful americans are resilient ! 
4847	1310	No , ASPECT_AMERICAN_CITIZEN , overwhelmingly ... Jollee 
4848	1311	As I said , extra-terrestrials . 
4849	1312	How does it feel to live in one of little sister countries ? 
4850	1313	They pay effective 15 regressive payroll tax . 
4851	1313	uber wealthy do n't effectively pay SS as percentage of they income . 
4852	1314	1500 retirees get in checks is what RETIREES use to polish shoe , RETIREES are too good to pay into SS but do n't mind enslaving people who will need 1500 one day . 
4853	1315	If of ASPECT_GENERAL_PUBLIC would open eyes , ASPECT_OBAMA ratings would plummet . 
4854	1316	He is false promise sheeple of world have bought into . 
4855	1316	Luckily , more and folks see true fraud that ASPECT_OBAMA is . 
4856	1317	I voted yes ... for now . 
4857	1317	could change or not in two years . 
4858	1317	being said , how could call ASPECT_OBAMA worst president in history when we just had 8 years of gwb amazes I . 
4859	1318	Whether you and your ASPECT_FELLOW_LIBERAL like it or not , ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY is NOT ASPECT_ENTITLEMENT_PROGRAM and is not means based . 
4860	1318	You seem to think ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY should be another welfare program . 
4861	1318	YOU already have one of . 
4862	1318	ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY is program in which what you get out is proportional to what you put into SECURITY . 
4863	1320	Just have to open your eyes . 
4864	1321	Please open eyes . 
4865	1321	In you view , what actions by ASPECT_OBAMA make ASPECT_OBAMA worst president of time ? 
4866	1322	I would n't dream of voting for him . 
4867	1322	And I preferred HIM over hillary two years ago . 
4869	1322	`` who should not have been President 
4870	1324	ASPECT_CLINTON raised taxes , cut ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING , and got us to surplus budget . 
4871	1324	ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_CUT_TAX , raised ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING , and got ASPECT_US to record deficits . 
4872	1324	Not at exactly alike in my book . 
4873	1325	Here are national debt figures , year by year . 
4874	1325	Would you kindly point out ASPECT_CLINTON surplus where we REDUCED ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT ? 
4875	1325	I am not slighting in way excellent control of spending done by president ASPECT_CLINTON AND ASPECT_CLINTON ASPECT_REPUBLICAN controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
4876	1325	But fact is WE still went further in debt .

4879	1326	If you are looking for budget surpluses or deficits , why are you posting debt figures ? 
4880	1326	debt is how has been cumulatively borrowed for given point in time ; budget surplus or deficit measures revenues and expenditures for given period , normally fiscal year . 
4881	1326	Here 's link to budget , showing surplus in 1999 and 2000 .

4883	1327	revealing aspects of your reply . 
4884	1327	First , what happens on particular day of fiscal year is without merit . 
4885	1327	fiscal year of ASPECT_U_GOVT is 9\/30 to 9\/30 . 
4886	1327	What is on Mar 19 , or dec 31 means because books are simply open on days . 
4887	1327	When books are closed for year -LRB- 9\/30 -RRB- then we have . 
4888	1327	Second your link to cbo shows that ASPECT_CLINTON years of spending , until ASPECT_CLINTON got SADDLED with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS , was larger than ASPECT_BUSH years . 
4889	1327	In dollars not adjusted for inflation . 
4890	1327	And SECOND shows as I have claimed that receipts under ASPECT_BUSH , before and after , ASPECT_TAX_CUT EXCEEDED , and years of ASPECT_CLINTON . 
4891	1327	And SECOND shows that as &#37; of GDP , Debt was higher in year of ASPECT_CLINTON than &#37; was in year of ASPECT_BUSH . 
4892	1327	And evidently ASPECT_CBO , who is not responsible for PAYING bills , just crunching numbers , does not count ever mounting interest , that ASPECT_TREASURY does when they have to pay bills with phantom surpluses . 
4893	1327	You do ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON disservice by claiming ASPECT_CLINTON made surplus . 
4894	1327	ASPECT_CLINTON was wiser c-in-c than present clown . 
4895	1327	ASPECT_CLINTON got handed opposing congress . 
4896	1327	ASPECT_CLINTON went into meeting rooms WITH ` enemy ' and haggled out agreement .

4898	1327	Republicans could not say no to . 
4899	1327	clown bo goes into meeting rooms with liberal democrats only and LOCKS out others and then complains that no one will cooperate with THEN . 
4900	1327	Being ASPECT_CHICAGO mob boss , BOSS never learned cooperate is different than dictate . 
4901	1327	ASPECT_CLINTON was wise and made of bad situation . 
4902	1327	BO is stupid and made worst of good situation . 
4903	1327	BO had power and blew WORST with bo intransigence and arrogance and lack of experience and plain ideological stupidity .

4939	1333	Opposing one of ASPECT_STATES along with foreign government . 
4940	1333	Approving mosque near ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO . 
4941	1333	Appointing too czars to avoid confirmation hearings . 
4942	1333	Moratorium on oil drilling . 
4943	1333	I 'm sure that can be added . 
4944	1334	With as as we have endured , now WE must accept burial site of terrorist muslim jihad terrorist attack with Mosque being built with name of ASPECT_CORDOVA ASPECT_WHICH represents there conquer 0f Spanish in 8th century , to entomb we ASPECT_AMERICAN citizens ! 
4945	1334	kiss my Ass tolerance , you have to be kidding MY !

4949	1334	Jollee -LRB- aint no sunshine with -RRB- ... . 
4951	1335	I agree . 
4952	1335	liberal left , appeasing , pandering , anti-Americans are destroying ASPECT_AMERICA . 
4953	1335	They need to go . 
4954	1339	I 'd guess that year med student has desire to learn , while oBum thinks he knows now and public is stooopid . 
4955	1340	You 're one who brought up debt , which is amount Govt owes . 
4956	1340	ONE 's not measure of budget . 
4957	1340	debt decreased 114 billion in year ending 12\/31\/00 . 
4958	1340	I appreciate you do n't like fact . 
4959	1340	No ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRESIDENT achieved . 
4960	1340	I disagree FACT means . 
4961	1340	year &#37; chng outlays .1993 2.01 1994 3.72 2001 4.13 2002 7.94 How do you figure ? 
4962	1340	fact revenues eventually increased is pretty meaningless . 
4963	1340	As percentage of GDP , compared to inflation , or percentage change , revenues under ASPECT_BUSH tanked , and did superb under ASPECT_CLINTON . 
4964	1340	Just where do you get nonsense ? 
4967	1340	Consider objective sources . 
4968	1340	Year - Debt : GDP1993 66.2 -LRB- - Clinton1994 66.2 1995 67.1 1996 66.7 1997 65.0 1998 62.8 1999 60.5 2000 57.0 2001 56.5 -LRB- - Bush2002 58.5 2003 60.9 2004 62.2 2005 62.8 2006 63.5 2007 64.0 2008 69.4 Interest payment is recorded as budget item by ASPECT_CBO . 
4969	1340	No myth at all . 
4970	1340	Whether you include ss or not , record deficit ASPECT_CLINTON inherited from ASPECT_BUSH was turned into surplus , and second ASPECT_BUSH took surplus and made new record deficit . 
4971	1340	ASPECT_CLINTON did SS be scaling back ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING and raising taxes . 
4972	1340	ASPECT_BUSH squandered ss by slashing taxes and doubling ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING and starting wars . 
4973	1340	ASPECT_OBAMA inherited ASPECT_ECONOMIC_CRISIS unparalleled since great depression . 
4974	1340	We 'll see whether ASPECT_OBAMA gets country back on right course . 
4975	1340	Sure , `` pass ASPECT_BUCK_GENERATION does n't want to pay taxes . 
4976	1340	ASPECT_REAGAN ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_BUSH pandered that sentiment big time . 
4977	1340	REASON main reason why WE have 13 trillion debt . 
4978	1341	If of right-wing nuts would admit truth , ASPECT_OBAMA ratings would go through roof ! 
4979	1342	You obviously do n't have capability of doing so or you would n't post nonsense . 
4980	1343	They are hoping that of wealth will eventually `` trickle down ! 
4981	1344	Are you for going against Constitution ? 
4982	1344	Amendment provides that right , so AMENDMENT is n't matter of what you have endured .1 st amend : amendment prohibits making of law `` respecting establishment of religion , impeding free exercise of religion , infringing on freedom of speech , infringing on freedom of press , interfering with right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting petitioning for governmental redress of grievances . 
4983	1344	I would like to know why you hate american muslims so much , but you defend ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR provides democracy for `` Muslims ? 
4984	1344	What is difference ? 
4985	1344	Are lives of 3000 dead in NY -LRB- ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO -RRB- more `` sacred than 4000 + ASPECT_AMERICAN soldiers have died in ASPECT_IRAQ at hands of Muslims ? 
4986	1344	Hypocrites speak out of both sides of ASPECT_HYPOCRITES mouths . 
4987	1344	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY needs to get brain . 
4988	1344	ASPECT_AMERICA is n't just about `` republicans or `` conservatives , ASPECT_FYI . 
4989	1345	right-wing wants to go against Constitution ! 
4990	1345	What joke ! 
4991	1345	First you say you defend , but you are willing to go against when does n't suit you ? 
4992	1346	Wrong answer . 
4993	1346	Conservatives adopt literal word-for-word interpretation of ASPECT_UNITED_STATE_CONSTITUTION as INTERPRETATION should be . 
4994	1346	Not ASPECT_LIBERAL jackwagon `` living document horse -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ! 
4995	1347	You think ? 
4996	1347	What literal word for word interpretation of `` provide for ... ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE could mean anything other than ASPECT_CONGRESS has authority to provide for ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE ? 
4997	1349	ASPECT_UNITED_STATE_CONSTITUTION contains two references to `` ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE , one occurring in Preamble and in Taxing and spending clause . 
4998	1349	It is only latter is referred to as `` general welfare clause of document . 
4999	1349	However , LATTER has been argued that , in case of ASPECT_UNITED_STATE_CONSTITUTION , statement regarding `` ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE was not then and is not now intended to give plenary power to ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT . 
5000	1349	-LRB- 2 -RRB- clauses in ASPECT_U.S. constitution are exceptions to typical use of general welfare clause , and are not considered grants of general legislative power to ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT as ASPECT_U.S. supreme court has held : Preamble to ASPECT_U.S. constitution `` has never been regarded as source of substantive power conferred on Government of ASPECT_UNITED_STATE or on of source departments ; -LRB- 3 -rrb- -LRB- 4 -RRB- and , \* that Associate Justice joseph story construction of Article I , section 8 general welfare clause as elaborated in story 1833 commentaries on Constitution of ASPECT_UNITED_STATE was correct interpretation . 
5001	1349	-LRB- 5 -rrb- -LRB- 6 -RRB- Justice story concluded that general welfare clause was not independent grant of power , but qualification on taxing power which included within CLAUSE power to spend ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE on matters of general interest to ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT . 
5002	1349	ASPECT_THOMAS_JEFFERSON explained latter general welfare clause for ASPECT_UNITED_STATE : -LRB- -RRB- jefferson laying of taxes is power , and ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE purpose for which power is to be exercised . 
5003	1349	AND -LRB- ASPECT_CONGRESS -RRB- are not to lay taxes ad libitum for purpose AND please ; but only to pay debts or provide for welfare of Union . 
5004	1349	In like manner , AND are not to do anything AND please to provide for ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE , but only to lay taxes for purpose . 
5005	1349	-LRB- 7 -RRB- In 1824 Chief Justice ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_MARSHALL described in obiter dictum further limit on general welfare clause in gibbons v. ogden : `` ASPECT_CONGRESS is authorized to lay and collect taxes , & c. to pay debts and provide for common defense and ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE of ASPECT_UNITED_STATE . 
5006	1349	ASPECT_CONGRESS is not empowered to tax for purposes which are within exclusive province of ASPECT_STATES . 
5007	1349	-LRB- 8 -RRB- 
5008	1350	is supposed to be literal word for word interpretation ? 
5009	1351	ASPECT_CONGRESS shall make no law respecting establishment of religion , or prohibiting free exercise thereof ; or abridging freedom of speech , or of press ; or right of people peaceably to assemble , and to petition Government for redress of grievances . 
5010	1351	Let see . 
5011	1351	Conservatives take `` ASPECT_CONGRESS shall make no law respecting establishment of religion or prohibiting free exercise thereof to mean , Only for establishments of religion ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY and\/or conservatives approve of . 
5012	1351	`` right of people peaceably to assemble means PEOPLE can only assemble where Republicans\/Conservatives think PEOPLE should , not where REPUBLICANS\/CONSERVATIVES is legal for PEOPLE , or where PEOPLE want to . 
5013	1351	You actually mean , as PEOPLE want RIGHT to be , right ? 
5015	1352	Because ASPECT_YEAR_MEDICAL_STUDENT is n't really ASPECT_YEAR_MEDICAL_STUDENT , is just what Faux news told you . 
5016	1352	ASPECT_OBAMA served 8 years as Senator of ASPECT_ILLINOIS before serving 2 years for us ASPECT_SENATE . 
5017	1352	And , because so called `` surgeon you speak of was old doctor who followed practices\/skills as surgeon mentor -LRB- ASPECT_BUSH -RRB- , who had killed lot of people during surgery , and SURGEON had airhead Bimbo for surgeon nurse who had no experience as nurse , but SO could see `` hospital from so house and so thought that qualified so . 
5018	1353	So did ASPECT_YEAR_MEDICAL_STUDENT in analogy . 
5019	1353	ASPECT_OBAMA policies were and are identical to ASPECT_BUSH \ \/ mccain . 
5020	1354	I disagree . 
5021	1354	Enough of bizarre manipulations of Government . 
5022	1354	Just go to simple consumption tax , and have ASPECT_TAX_RATE be amount needed for federal yearly budget . 
5023	1354	Budget goes up - adjust consumption tax percentage . 
5024	1355	Now , now . 
5025	1355	Let NOW not make fun of mcsame and juggs when they are n't here to defend THEY . 
5026	1356	loopholes and exemptions are bizzare manipulations . 
5027	1356	consumption tax is regressive . 
5028	1356	Just do simple income tax with progressive rates ASPECT_HIGH_ENOUGH for ASPECT_FEDERAL_BUDGET . 
5029	1356	Budget goes up , increase ASPECT_TAX_RATE . 
5030	1357	isolationist thinking has caused downfall of cultures throughout history . 
5031	1357	Hunkering down in time of global networking is myopic strategy for strengthening influence of nation . 
5032	1357	is part of why Liberals are often frustrated with Conservatives , outward vs. inward thinking . 
5033	1357	What evidence have you seen that President cares about people that live in countries ? 
5034	1358	Why progressive rates ? 
5035	1358	is manipulation . 
5036	1358	Do poor people use ASPECT_POST_OFFICE equal to rich ? 
5037	1358	Do people want people borders maintained by militia and ASPECT_NAVY just like wealthy person would ? 
5038	1358	MILITIA seems to objective person that for part Americans benefit from having existance of ASPECT_UNCLE_SAM and in fact poor people are greater strain on system by using things wealthy do not , such as welfare , ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP , medicaid , section-8 housing , ASPECT_WIC , and others . 
5039	1358	People should pay for services uncle sam provides equally . 
5040	1358	If PEOPLE and I walk into McDonald together ; should we not be both charged price for we happy meal ? 
5041	1358	Would you think mcdonald fair if you were charged 50 because you were sporting Rolex , person next to you charged 5 because PERSON had ASPECT_TIMEX , and third person given happy meal for free because PERSON had no watch at all ? 
5042	1358	is not how fairness works . 
5043	1358	consumption based tax is fairest way to deal with ASPECT_FEDERAL_BUDGET , anything less is biased and offends . 
5044	1359	Progressive rates because 20 &#37; tax on guy trying to support family on 20k means GUY family does without basic necessities . 
5045	1359	40 tax on guy making hundred million means GUY might have to buy smaller mega-yacht . 
5046	1359	But guy family does n't have to worry about paying doctor or for education . 
5047	1359	I disagree that Govt should be fee based enterprise . 
5048	1360	I have ocean front property in ASPECT_NEVADA to sell you if you are gullible enough to believe that BS . 
5049	1360	Not kept ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_PROMISE . 
5050	1360	No specifics , of course for right winger . 
5051	1360	And no president keeps campaign promises . 
5052	1360	I remember certain president promised to cut trillion off ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT , not act as arrogant nation or be worlds policeman , etc. etc. transparancy , no not as much as hoped . 
5053	1360	But certainly not less transparant that republican would be or that ASPECT_BUSH was . 
5054	1360	raise taxes on everyone ... really , Your taxes have not gone up and neither have mine , so is right wing lie . 
5055	1360	expiration of ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT have not been addressed yet . 
5056	1360	increases spending\/size of government . 
5057	1360	Actually , ASPECT_OBAMA has spent less than ASPECT_BUSH did . 
5058	1360	And considering massive recession , RECESSION would be bad ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY to slash government . 
5059	1360	ASPECT_OBAMA has frozen ASPECT_FEDERAL_BUDGET for agencys , Republicans never did , created national debt commision , republicans never did , cut ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING , republicans never did and turned economy around from massive reccesion to small growth . 
5060	1360	Sure we would all like , but ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICY are far better than ASPECT_REPUBLICAN ones . 
5061	1360	ignroes people and pushed through legislation . 
5064	1360	ASPECT_REPUBLICANS have used reconcilliation policy far more than democrats , including pushing through both misguided ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
5065	1360	Democrats have had to override ASPECT_REPUBLICAN fillibuster of party of no on virtually everything , So I would say to stick with reality . 
5066	1360	And majority of ASPECT_AMERICANS think healthcare needed reform . 
5067	1360	And who wantas president that governs by polls anyway . 
5068	1360	has weakened national security\/border security . 
5069	1360	is type if pure ignorance really shows gullibility of right wing in nation . 
5070	1360	So of al qaida is at record lows . 
5071	1360	of al qaida killed is at record highs . 
5072	1360	of illegal immigrants deported is at record highs . 
5073	1360	troops are in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN and on ASPECT_BORDER . 
5074	1360	Republicans are so stupid that if president is not up there acting like -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- screaming that you are with us or against ASPECT_US , and `` bring on '' , REPUBLICANS are too dumb to see what progress is . 
5075	1360	Shunning ASPECT_US allies ... seriously . 
5076	1360	ASPECT_US allies like ASPECT_OBAMA hell of lit better than ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
5077	1360	is just plain ignorant lies . 
5078	1360	Just so you know , forming your opinion on peoples lies is dumb way to form your opinion . 
5079	1361	When are you liberals going to understand that issue is NOT that ASPECT_BUSH was good and oBum is bad , OR that ASPECT_BUSH was bad and oBum is good . 
5080	1361	issue is that ASPECT_BUSH WAS bad and oBum is worse . 
5081	1363	If you value jobs and want to have president who values security of nation , vote for ... . 
5082	1365	Your one of smart voting class to say least brother ! 
5084	1367	`` nuts on both sides do n't matter . 
5085	1367	It is Conservative country is finally awakening to truth . 
5086	1367	ASPECT_OBAMA ratings are not doing so good . 
5087	1368	Mertex , you have to constantly defend yourself in forums . 
5088	1368	Maybe , you should rethink who is posting nonsense . 
5089	1369	Unfortunately , policies are making businesses go to hell ... 
5090	1370	FREEDOM may not agree with ASPECT_ISLAM , but according to Constitution , mosques can be built in country in order to satisfy `` freedom of religion . 
5091	1370	FREEDOM just think there should be sensitivity concerning ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO , and mosque should not be built there . 
5092	1370	are not against Constitution like left . 
5093	1370	just want to see respect for victims of 9\/11 and families . 
5094	1370	Do you not want VICTIMS to be respected ? 
5095	1371	So , because no president keeps promises is free pass for ASPECT_OBAMA ? 
5096	1371	Just wait until 1\/1\/2011 . 
5097	1371	several tax increases will take place . 
5098	1371	Do n't worry , ASPECT_OBAMA has ASPECT_COUPLE_YEAR left to outspend ASPECT_BUSH . 
5099	1371	ASPECT_OBAMA contribution to deficit takes cake . 
5100	1371	ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION is responsible for actions of ASPECT_ARIZONA . 
5101	1371	DOHS has placed restrictions on local and state law enforcement agencies from performing immigration status checks and arrests . 
5102	1371	Now , they are siding with foreign government against one of its states . 
5103	1371	national guard troops that ASPECT_OBAMA has sent to border can not fire TROOPS weapons , and TROOPS can not enforce ASPECT_IMMIGRATION_LAW . 
5104	1371	TROOPS are there as ASPECT_LIP_SERVICE for wanting ASPECT_BORDER_SECURITY . 
5105	1371	Yeah , just ask ASPECT_ISRAEL . 
5106	1371	Not lies , but truth . 
5107	1371	You just have n't realized TRUTH yet . 
5108	1371	You just can not come to terms that ASPECT_OBAMA is anything but `` hope and change . 
5109	1372	If you remove incentive to gain wealth by always taking it away and giving IT to bottom percentile is looking for handout , eventually people lose drive to succeed . 
5110	1372	whole reason I bust I butt at work is to provide better life for I wife and children ; not to provide better life for bum with sign at off-ramp of interstate . 
5111	1372	is not how I Government is supposed to work . 
5112	1372	If wants to help failed in life , should do REASON via churches , not-for-profits , community outreach programs , post-tax dollar donations , etc. . 
5113	1372	American should pay amount for services government renders , just like ASPECT_AMERICAN should have to pay amount for cheeseburger at ASPECT_MCDONALDS . 
5114	1372	When you start redistributing wealth , then welcome to world of dr. karl marx , Ph.D. and goodbye to world of ASPECT_THOMAS_JEFFERSON . 
5115	1374	Sadly , point well taken . 
5116	1374	Between ASPECT_TAX_CUT , illegal immigration , and muslim mosque at ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO , I wonder if ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is trying to lose national election in three months . 
5117	1374	OBAMA certainly is not listening to rank and file Democrats . 
5118	1376	Funny about 1.3 trillion deficit carried over from ASPECT_PREVIOU_ADMINISTRATION is that ASPECT_TARP was huge part of DEFICIT . 
5119	1376	ASPECT_OBAMA voted for TARP and then fought to spend second half of 700 billion when in ASPECT_CONGRESS wanted to block funds . 
5120	1377	And TARP was passed by Democrat controlled house and ASPECT_SENATE , NOT Republican controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
5121	1377	ASPECT_BUSH complicity was in signing complicity . 
5122	1377	ASPECT_BUSH should have vetoed COMPLICITY . 
5123	1377	And 1.3 trillion carry over was ALSO from Democrat controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
5124	1377	TRILLION IS ASPECT_CONGRESS actually spends money . 
5125	1377	President is not one normally spends money . 
5126	1377	Unless president wife is vacationing in ASPECT_SPAIN . 
5127	1378	I just think it 's interesting that of peebo devotees are willing to overlook ASPECT_OBAMA complicity . 
5128	1378	ASPECT_OBAMA speaking out of both sides of ASPECT_OBAMA_MOUTH and objective response from obama useful idiots are occasional fainting spells . 
5129	1379	There were Muslims who died at ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO , also . 
5130	1379	Community center they are trying to build is not on ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO - CENTER is like two blocks away . 
5131	1379	Did you know Muslims have prayer room at ASPECT_PENTAGON ? 
5132	1379	plane hit there also , why are dead at ASPECT_PENTAGON not `` sacred like ones at ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO ? 
5133	1379	And what do Muslims are trying to build Mosque have to do with Al-Qaeda , ones hit towers ? 
5134	1379	Do we hold `` muslims responsible for what terrorists did ? 
5135	1379	If is case , then explain to me why WE sacrificed 4000 + soldiers to provide ASPECT_IRAQ with democracy . 
5136	1379	SOLDIERS are ASPECT_MUSLIMS , and ground in ASPECT_IRAQ is sacred as we soldiers died there . 
5137	1379	Republican\/conservative argument does n't make sense . 
5138	1379	Please explain where Democrats are against Constitution . 
5139	1379	You claim you are not against Constitution , you just do n't want to do what constitution says . 
5140	1379	And now , bunch of radicals are trying to change 14th amendment ? 
5141	1379	Yeah , you are not against Constitution , you are just trying to rewrite CONSTITUTION . 
5142	1379	And , ME do n't see how community center\/mosque two blocks away in way disrespects people died on 9\/11 . 
5143	1379	If was trying to build statue in honor of 19 hijackers -LRB- ASPECT_AL_QAEDA -RRB- ME would definitely be against STATUE , but mosque is n't being built to honor hijackers . 
5144	1380	Disputing would only prolong silliness of your hypothesis . 
5145	1380	WASTE waste of time . 
5146	1381	Is , `` I ca n't , in liberal doublespeak ? 
5147	1382	funny is , is that 48 billion is still sitting in treasury is part of ASPECT_STIMULUS_FUND . 
5148	1382	They threw money into shovel ready jobs and pork projects but why do n't THEY just give what 's left back so taxpayers do n't have as debt ? 
5149	1382	Why is money just sitting there ? 
5150	1383	Tell to families of victims of 9\/11 . 
5151	1383	There are also questions surrounding funding of mosque by folks related to ASPECT_AL-QAEDA . 
5152	1383	Also , there is no muslim prayer room at ASPECT_PENTAGON . 
5153	1383	I have been there . 
5154	1383	CHAPEL is non-denominational pentagon memorial chapel . 
5155	1383	I think ASPECT_CHAPEL has to do with funding . 
5156	1383	I 'm sure they can come up with plan to build CHAPEL elsewhere . 
5157	1384	There are muslim families of victims of 9\/11 . 
5158	1384	What about FAMILIES ? 
5159	1384	And of uproar is coming from right-wing , who has taken UPROAR upon FAMILIES to equate Muslims with ASPECT_AL-QAEDA . 
5160	1384	Is there links to back UPROAR up or is UPROAR just speculation ?

5199	1390	TERRIFIED am terrified of ASPECT_OBAMA . 
5200	1390	ASPECT_OBAMA is giving away children birthright in multi-trillion dollar chunks and ASPECT_OBAMA has hallmarks of dictator by forcing to buy product by force of law and jail -LRB- even if stated otherwise \*\* -RRB- .

5209	1391	They probably will , in fact there are talks that THEY might . 
5210	1391	And means that Muslims are lot more reasonable and understanding than recalcitrant republicans . 
5211	1391	Why are you attributing what 19 ASPECT_AL_QAEDA did to ASPECT_MUSLIMS ? 
5212	1391	Should Christians be blamed when Christian commits horrible crime ? 
5213	1391	is totally bizarre - church , or religious monument is usually symbol of peace and love . 
5214	1391	I think person is not being `` honest - just upset because MOSQUE happens to be ASPECT_MUSLIM . 
5215	1391	Do n't think they are certain . 
5216	1391	But MOSQUE is n't even `` mosque - MOSQUE community center . 
5217	1391	So your whole argument breaks down . 
5218	1391	Reps do n't like Constitution as it is written because ASPECT_CONSTITUTION interferes with reps agenda . 
5219	1391	You are kidding , of course . 
5220	1391	of your posts reflect right-wing , ASPECT_GOP , ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_IDEOLOGY ! 
5221	1392	Then except for gop part , he posts pretty good . 
5222	1392	And I think you got gop part wrong . 
5223	1392	You always try to paint I with brush to . 
5224	1393	Then except for gop part , he posts pretty good . 
5225	1393	And I think you got gop part wrong . 
5226	1393	You always try to paint I with brush to . 
5227	1396	Republicans are n't ones against Mosque near ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO . 
5228	1396	I never did . 
5229	1396	I just think sensitivity to victims ' families needs to be taken into consideration . 
5230	1396	islamic community center . 
5231	1396	can be said of politicians . 
5232	1396	of I posts reflect , I am sick of bloated bureaucracy in ASPECT_WASHINGTON wasting ASPECT_TAX_DOLLAR and not listening to People . 
5233	1396	Unless your happy with ASPECT_WASHINGTON , big government , taxes , bureaucracy , you should be part of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT yourself . 
5234	1398	When you 're waiting hour and half for plane , do you ever wonder why you have to get there so early ? 
5235	1398	Do you ever wonder why your family does n't get to come to gate to see you off like they used to ? 
5236	1398	estimated 7 of Muslims are radical . 
5237	1398	works out to about 84,000,000 by conservative estimates . 
5238	1399	Because she says garbage you do ? 
5240	1399	If ASPECT_BWAHAHAHA walks like duck , looks like duck , quacks like duck , ASPECT_BWAHAHAHA is duck ! 
5241	1400	Gee , if is true , then why were you willing that sacrifice over 4000 + of soldiers to give `` muslims democracy ? 
5242	1400	How do know that of 84,000,000 are not in ASPECT_IRAQ ? 
5243	1400	How do Reps get to designate which ones are bad ? 
5244	1401	You have handful of Dems got sucked into `` sensitivity bs and ASPECT_HARRY_REID , who is vying for votes from whacko Angle , so REID has to appeal to righties . 
5245	1401	When you associate american muslims with 9\/11 incident you are in sense holding righties responsible for INCIDENT . 
5246	1401	RIGHTIES had victims there too . 
5247	1401	INCIDENT is still not mosque . 
5248	1401	politicians are n't trying to change amendments like reps are . 
5249	1401	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is farce . 
5250	1401	of supporters of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY would bring back in minute , no matter what he did to country . 
5252	1402	is post and I may have made typo or three . 
5253	1402	If you see that angers you such as I not adding &#8216; radical &#8217; prefix before &#8216; muslim &#8217; please ask I if is what I meant ! 
5254	1402	I have no problems with islam or muslims or religion including have lack of religion . 
5255	1402	I do have problem with haters who hate for unspecified reasons or simply don &#8217; like Christianity or religion and have need to bash Christians at turn . 
5256	1402	And as preacher church owner , and non profit Christian humanitarian mission owner I do not tolerate or will not be around I Christian brothers and sisters that hate for reasons as above . 
5257	1402	whew ~ hi mertex ! 
5258	1402	If supporters and doing funding -LRB- no one knows who is funding Mosque as of aug 1 2010 -RRB- etc would build somewhere else I would be willing to bet that conservative group would donate land to build GROUP on as reciprocal gesture of good faith . 
5259	1402	FUNDING just guess but I know I conservatives . 
5260	1402	-LRB- I lean towards conservative side mostly because of I religion -RRB- . 
5261	1402	Nevertheless , If CONSERVATIVES go ahead with plans to build mosque mosque will be very dangerous place to be and MOSQUE will breed seething , venomous anger all way round ' . 
5262	1402	mosque supporters certainly have right to build MOSQUE , but what gesture gesture would be if SUPPORTERS decided to move GESTURE ! 
5263	1402	As devout Christian I too think is wrong . 
5264	1402	Maybe CHRISTIAN meant radical Muslims ? 
5265	1402	Moderate islam is beautiful religion fairly mirrors Christianity right up to where ASPECT_ABRAHAM almost sacrifices abraham son . 
5266	1402	I surgeon of five years is devout muslim , and she is beautiful I must say ! 
5267	1402	Trust I if I lumped Muslims together I would find another md ! 
5268	1402	Yes , but is point , There are too coincidences for there not to be malicious going on . 
5269	1402	I was somewhat against mosque before I found out that MOSQUE would be dedicated on anniversary of 9\/11 ! 
5270	1402	was what turned I against MOSQUE , Then I researched where funding originated and cordoba group etc. . 
5271	1402	bad feelings ! 
5272	1402	I feel true intent is not good . 
5273	1402	I also feel that good muslims that support Mosque as well as secular liberals etc have been fooled by malicious element into believing that intent and purpose of projected mosque is benign and meant to foster good will etc. . 
5274	1402	Can you clarify and expand on ? 
5275	1402	What is wrong with right-wing , gop , ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_IDEOLOGY ? 
5276	1402	Personally being Anarchist -LRB- I would like to rearrange usa completely -RRB- but ASPECT_REGISTERED_INDEPENDENT I feel that right-wing , gop , ASPECT_TEA_PARTY will save country from sure destruction by well meaning liberals . 
5277	1402	LIBERALS are led by malicious element who thinks can spend way out of recession . 
5278	1402	Yes malicious element is none other than ASPECT_OBAMA ! 
5279	1402	ASPECT_OBAMA insists on socializing country , which is another sure way to break bank . 
5280	1402	OBAMA seems hell bent to do to ruin shaky recovery -LRB- and jobless one at -RRB- . 
5281	1402	And I think ASPECT_OBAMA has plans for making usa fully socialist . 
5282	1402	Then there is fact that administration thinks can appease taliban types or ben laden style terrorists who are freedom fighters of major islamic world powers . 
5283	1402	states want to destroy ASPECT_ISRAEL and usa asap . 
5284	1402	terrorist sponsoring nations and oil rich citizens fund & give aid and support to anti christian anti secular western terrorists and islamic militants . 
5285	1402	CITIZENS stated primary goal is to convert or kill of us including children and everyone does not convert to Islam . 
5286	1402	goal time to give militarized radical ASPECT_ISLAMIC_TERRORIST offer terrorists should not and ultimately can not refuse . 
5287	1402	TIME should TERRORIST fair offer . 
5288	1402	However , should then take zero tolerance policy with regards to terror and began isolating western hemisphere militarily industrially economically scientifically with emphasis on pure r & d . 
5290	1403	Your misconceptions , misunderstandings , and outright fear of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY make your posts about them laughable . 
5291	1403	NO one at ASPECT_TEA_PARTY I 've attended would ever think of bringing ASPECT_BUSH back even if NO was possible . 
5292	1403	near ASPECT_INSTANTANEOU_GROWTH of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY after elections was because we thought WE could put calamity of ASPECT_BUSH years behind WE and get on with repairing nation . 
5293	1403	Instead WE were presented with even incompetent idiot clown without clue of what Presidency means or how to even begin doing job . 
5294	1403	And now approaching 2 years later , clown shows on daily basis that CLOWN is in fact clown that history will find hilarious , but not for , years . 
5295	1403	good news is CLOWN has started another vacation . 
5296	1403	time on ASPECT_MARTHA ASPECT_VINEYARD for 10 days . 
5297	1403	Did they get unpacked from one ? 
5298	1403	But when 10 's on vacation , 10 's doing less damage to nation . 
5299	1403	Failure on daily basis must be so extremely exhausting that 10 needs constant vacations . 
5300	1403	When liberals lose control of ASPECT_CONGRESS in nov. 10 will need overlapping vacations from then on . 
5301	1404	Are you claiming that Muslims are trying to convert wal-mart building into community center are radical muslims ? 
5302	1404	Otherwise , ASPECT_WAL-MART does n't make sense - why you would associate YOU with ASPECT_AL_QAEDA is responsible for 9\/11 . 
5303	1404	ASPECT_WAL-MART would be understandable if YOU were , that YOU would not be welcome sight anywhere near ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO . 
5304	1404	ASPECT_GOP have no doubt that there would be Christian -LRB- wealthy person -RRB- would be more than generous and would donate land , but of ones complaining are more interested in just denying people people constitutional right and have created `` sensitivity bs , since building is not even close to ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO . 
5305	1404	ASPECT_GOP realize that , but conservatives do less that resembles what Christ would want CONSERVATIVES to do when LAND comes to politics , that gop wonder why so believe are doing what Christ would want to do . 
5306	1404	gop wonder if Christians were ones building church and Muslims were complaining , if Christians would be as willing to move or would ONES do what so many of ONES do , and become violent and hateful . 
5307	1404	Like when ONES are told to remove statue of 10 commandments out of government building - and ONES go against laws ? 
5308	1404	If Muslims are willing to build somewhere else , would be great , but ASPECT_GOP can not see where we can disregard what Constitution guarantees just to placate people sensitivities . 
5309	1404	Christians have to be sensitive to feelings of others , too . 
5310	1404	She was attributing waits at airports and changes WE have had to get used to , due to horrible crime committed on 9\/11 by ASPECT_ISLAMIC_TERRORIST , but TERRORISTS do not make up islam religion , so it is wrong to condemn of them for what extremists of terrorists religion are doing . 
5311	1404	gop answer to SHE was , if `` Muslims are to be suspect , then why did WE sacrifice 4000 + of we men and women to provide with Democracy . 
5312	1404	WE are willing to sacrifice ASPECT_WE_LIFE to provide with democracy but start whining at building mosque , or community center ? 
5313	1404	You tell ASPECT_GOP where makes sense . 
5314	1404	Unfortunately , of ones protesting community center claim that ONES do n't have anything against ASPECT_MUSLIMS , but if you are not able to distinguish between were responsible for 9\/11 and who lost loved ones on 9\/11 , and want to build would be good , claim becomes blurred . 
5315	1404	ASPECT_GOP just read article where leaders of planned community center have decided against building center there . 
5316	1404	ARTICLE would seem to GOP that if LEADERS had malicious agenda leaders would not have given up . 
5317	1404	However , how do you feel about : ASPECT_NEW_YORK_REPUBLICAN_PARTY is also said to be planning hostile ASPECT_TELEVISION_CAMPAIGN . 
5318	1404	Does n't sound like bunch of Christians to ASPECT_GOP . 
5319	1404	What evil could gop possible be planning ? 
5320	1404	If they are really evil motivated people , again , why do Republicans\/conservatives defend ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR ? 
5321	1404	Now you have gone and called muslims ignorant . 
5322	1404	THEY would not be able to figure out that THEY are being manipulated , sounds little condescending and that ASPECT_GOP find alarming coming from calls CONDESCENDING Christian . 
5323	1404	As if , oppose Mosque are ones blessed with ability to see beyond obvious , and know what is in people hearts . 
5324	1404	There are mosques in area , and also bars . 
5325	1404	So , why does one hold `` special powers ? 
5326	1404	On Sunday , jon kyl -LRB- R-AZ -RRB- went on Face Nation and suggested , that with ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABY running around , SUNDAY might be time to scrap 14th amendment . 
5327	1404	Now , ASPECT_SENATE minority leader agrees . 
5328	1404	ASPECT_SENATE minority leader ASPECT_MITCH ASPECT_MCCONNELL is latest high-profile republican to say ASPECT_CONGRESS should reconsider guarantee of birthright citizenship provided by 14th amendment , in light of current debate over immigration reform . 
5329	1404	http : \ \/ \ \/ firedoglake.com \ \/ 2010\/08\/03 \ \/ re...-brown-people \ \/ I did n't say there was anything wrong with ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_IDEOLOGY , ASPECT_GOP was just reminding poster that even if 14TH claims 14TH is n't , 14TH posts say otherwise . 
5330	1404	But , as far as right-wing , gop , ASPECT_TEA_PARTY saving country , of people are part of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY were ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_BUSH supporters and know what ASPECT_BUSH did to country . 
5331	1404	And gop know of people ideology is `` ASPECT_TAX_CUT for wealthy ! 
5332	1404	Pardon expression but is bunch of crap . 
5333	1404	is rhetoric ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH and rest of wealthy republicans are saying because PEOPLE want to keep people tax cuts . 
5335	1404	ASPECT_GOP thought you sounded rational for while - now you are beginning to sound like rest of `` scared to death by gop media crowd . 
5336	1406	ITS s run down textile mill . 
5337	1406	No am not saying . 
5338	1406	CHRISTIAN am suspicious of why ITS being built were its being build and do not believe developer . 
5339	1406	CHRISTIAN fully agree It was not moderate muslims fault that religion is being hijacked by radical elements . 
5340	1406	developers are within developers rights to build FAULT . 
5341	1406	And open and dedicate on 9\/11 . 
5342	1406	But having right does not make building RIGHT right ! 
5343	1406	CHRISTIAN feel bad for both sides that there is so torment over mosque , however CHRISTIAN can understand why majority of Americans are against MOSQUE . 
5344	1406	mosque five hundred feet from ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO . 
5345	1406	terrorists were muslim extremist . 
5346	1406	prayers will blast out over loud speaker five times day reminding victims and family s of victims what happened . 
5347	1406	CHRISTIAN am happy you are of faith ! 
5348	1406	CHRISTIAN too am Christian . 
5349	1406	CHRISTIAN was atheist prior to but god broke CHRISTIAN legs to make CHRISTIAN offer christian couldn t refuse ie die or try Christianity ! 
5350	1406	ha ha . 
5351	1406	Anyway well with due respect christian disagree with popular interpretation of ASPECT_ROMANS . 
5352	1406	Here is site that CHRISTIAN think mirrors CHRISTIAN understanding of scripture . 
5353	1406	SITE s different than what you believe , but maybe we can at least understand others beliefs . 
5354	1406	CHRISTIAN am guilty of calling ASPECT_OBAMA names out of anger and fear and agree ANGER not anything to be proud of , but CHRISTIAN do not think ANGER s terribly bad sin . 
5355	1406	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.wnd.com\/news\/article.asp ? 
5355	1406	ARTICLE_ID = 22417Sorry for not putting ANGER in CHRISTIAN words but CHRISTIAN have been writing grant proposals for missions two days and nights non stop so least typing christian have to do better ! 
5356	1406	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.wnd.com\/news\/article.asp ? 
5356	1406	article id = 22417sorry 500 feet from ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO and call to prayer will easily be heard at ASPECT_GROUND_ZERO . 
5357	1406	CHRISTIAN am surprised that you think 3000 families of dead and double that wounded would be lying about harm is going to do . 
5358	1406	saddens CHRISTIAN that you would think especially after you are so adamant about offending ASPECT_OBAMA by calling obama names etc. . 
5359	1406	Think about 3000 . 
5360	1406	3000 families s at least six to nine thousand people not to mention survivors of attacks . 
5361	1406	CHRISTIAN don t think FAMILIES want to deny families rights , but kind of will breed anger and hurt . 
5362	1406	for what ? 
5363	1406	What by protesting mosque ? 
5364	1406	CHRISTIAN agree that liberal politics are more in line with jesus teachings , but CHRISTIAN would not fear ASPECT_JESUS if CHRISTIAN were in peaceful protest march when JESUS came back . 
5365	1406	CHRISTIAN believe developers of mosque has hidden motives for building mosque too . 
5366	1406	CHRISTIAN will be interested in seeing where funding is coming from . 
5367	1406	Christians would not build church on top of muslim cemetery for starters , and CHRISTIAN believe STARTERS would . 
5368	1406	CHRISTIAN are Christian would you move your church if situation was reversed ? 
5369	1406	CHRISTIAN would . 
5370	1406	With due respect , you seem less and less like Christian you talk . 
5371	1406	ten commandants plaques are tradition in cases . 
5372	1406	ASPECT_CONGRESS prays for tradition as well . 
5373	1406	In cases ASPECT_CONGRESS s attitude of activist atheists make Christians bow up . 
5374	1406	In case CHRISTIAN have seen atheists want to harm or destroy Christianity by forcing ends to held traditions . 
5375	1406	In cases atheists want to harm us not to improve anything . 
5376	1406	Your ideas of obeying corrupt government are not Christian CHRISTIAN friend . 
5377	1406	CHRISTIAN wish you would take time to read opposing views . 
5378	1406	link christian gave you is start . 
5379	1406	Remember ASPECT_JESUS was rebel . 
5380	1406	True christian never have . 
5381	1406	CHRISTIAN am Reverend . 
5382	1406	So CHRISTIAN see and talk to lot of Christians . 
5383	1406	There is ignorance out there , however traditional christians do not hate ASPECT_MUSLIMS , just radicalized terrorists want to impose christians religion on us or murder ASPECT_US . 
5384	1406	CHRISTIAN already did in CHRISTIAN post . 
5385	1406	CHRISTIAN gave ASPECT_SEVERAL_REASON and CHRISTIAN am researching mosque hoping to run down funding . 
5386	1406	What would you say if ASPECT_ISLAMIC_TERRORIST were funding part of Mosque ? 
5387	1406	You are rather insensitive . 
5388	1406	Or maybe CHRISTIAN am misreading your post please clarify POST ? 
5389	1406	Yea and Mosque too ? 
5390	1406	ASPECT_NEW_YORK_REPUBLICAN_PARTY is also said to be planning hostile ASPECT_TELEVISION_CAMPAIGN . 
5391	1406	REPUBLICAN depends on how hostile program is CHRISTIAN suppose . 
5392	1406	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN bad stuff . 
5393	1406	CHRISTIAN fear that will get blown up or after THING built will happen . 
5394	1406	CHRISTIAN just wish THEMSELVES would not put THEMSELVES and city full of people in harms way and build somewhere else . 
5395	1406	see post one was over ten thousand letters over limit ! 
5396	1406	end of part one ! 
5397	1407	part two ! 
5398	1407	If they are really evil motivated people , again , THEY could be planning or preparing for anything . 
5399	1407	I am not saying THEY are . 
5400	1407	However I have been around block times and I have found that when peoples deeds do not match THEY words is rotten in ASPECT_DENMARK ! 
5401	1407	Too things do not make sense ! 
5402	1407	We will have to wait and see I suppose . 
5403	1407	God help we we are going to need BLOCK . 
5404	1407	You have very strange way of thinking , not bad just strange . 
5405	1407	Absolutely no disrespect meant ! 
5406	1407	However , if I was casually reading your posts I would think that ATHEIST were secular humanist atheist . 
5407	1407	Not immoral atheist\/sh , but atheist nevertheless conservatives must think ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR was worthwhile . 
5408	1407	I don and I do lean conservative . 
5410	1407	Did you read I disclaimer ? 
5411	1407	Where did I call Muslims ignorant ? 
5412	1407	I hope is not your words in I mouth ! 
5413	1407	Oh god will go to heaven and who will not . 
5414	1407	So if I were you I would not be throwing rocks cause you sure are living in glass crib -LRB- house -rrb- ! 
5415	1407	No s not what I said . 
5416	1407	Muslims as well as Christians follow muslims leaders . 
5417	1407	I do not trust developers etc. . 
5418	1407	ASPECT_GENERAL_POPULATION of Muslims are wonderful people , which I have said over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ! 
5419	1407	Even posting disclaimer ! 
5420	1407	Because DISCLAIMER being dedicated on 9\/11 being built on nearly on top if not on top of remains of victims , because funding is hidden and VICTIMS will not reveal DISCLAIMER , because of name of center . 
5421	1407	And there is more . 
5422	1407	Thanks for your reply and write soon ! 
5424	1408	I THINK ASPECT_BUSH kept SMALL amount OF SOLDIERS IN ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN because ASPECT_BUSH was not planning ON PROCEEDING WITH sensless war ... . 
5425	1408	ASPECT_BUSH thought ASPECT_BUSH would place credence IN BORDERS , AND pull men from That region since is no grounds to fight , are holes , heat , and deflection , war is stupid to fight in region of world , men are much more important ... JolleeNOTE : Although ASPECT_OBAMA said ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN war was right war ! 
5426	1409	hi jolee . 
5427	1409	Well at least in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN we were killing goons supported taliban cowardly murderous actions of 9\/11 . 
5428	1409	can not be said for ASPECT_IRAQ two though . 
5429	1409	I admire your passion . 
5430	1409	Rev AOh attachment . 
5431	1409	I thin frame 1911 military spc .45 colt style pistol -LRB- 1911 springfield armory -RRB- with wilson combat magazine . 
5432	1409	I like forty five for conceal carry because although spc heavy heavy thin , thin enough to were over HEAVY . 
5433	1409	big bullet is from full size .50 browning machine gun round -LRB- BMG -RRB- 
5434	1410	hi jolee . 
5435	1410	Well at least in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN we were killing goons supported taliban cowardly murderous actions of 9\/11 . 
5436	1410	can not be said for ASPECT_IRAQ two though . 
5437	1410	I admire your passion . 
5438	1410	Rev AOh attachment . 
5439	1410	I thin frame 1911 military spc .45 colt style pistol -LRB- 1911 springfield armory -RRB- with wilson combat magazine . 
5440	1410	I like forty five for conceal carry because although spc heavy heavy thin , thin enough to were over HEAVY . 
5441	1410	big bullet is from full size .50 browning machine gun round -LRB- BMG -RRB- 
5442	1411	Are you saying that model 1911 .45 caliber bullet is as browning .50 bullet ? 
5443	1411	Not complete round , but just bullet . 
5444	1411	If so , you have n't clue about weapons at all , and are simply child trolling on site . 
5445	1411	differences in bullets are , different diameters , different lengths , different weights , different shapes , and can not be fired from gun , either .45 , or .50 . 
5446	1411	similarities are that they are both called bullets . 
5447	1412	First , I wish you would learn how to post - would make lot easier to respond to you if you used conventional method provided by ASPECT_PF . 
5448	1412	And , to answer your question - No , QUESTION does n't make sense . 
5449	1412	If you are lumping Muslims together as responsible for 9\/11 , then pray tell why in hell are we killing we soldiers to provide `` muslims in ASPECT_IRAQ with democracy . 
5450	1412	is what does n't make sense . 
5451	1412	conservatives cheer and whoop muslims up 4000 + soldiers have given CONSERVATIVES lives to give Muslims in ASPECT_IRAQ democracy and then whine , -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- and revolt over Muslims building community center . 
5452	1412	So , you blame `` muslims for what 19 al-qaeda terrorists did ? 
5453	1412	figures . 
5454	1412	Ignorance abounds . 
5455	1412	September 11 attacks -LRB- often referred to as September 11th or 9\/11 -RRB- were series of coordinated suicide attacks by al-Qaeda upon ASPECT_UNITED_STATE on September 11 , 2001 . 
5456	1412	On morning , 19 al-qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial passenger jet airliners . 
5457	1412	So , are you suggesting that islam mosque 's in ASPECT_US are dangerous and should be destroyed ? 
5458	1412	Your comment does n't make sense . 
5459	1412	I think your comments are convoluted . 
5460	1413	fact that you ignore antics of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , crazy whacko like sharon angle and WHACKO off wall suggestions , rantings of ASPECT_PALIN and ASPECT_MICHELLE ASPECT_BACHMANN and claim that ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is somehow answer to ASPECT_AMERICA problems is what is truly laughable . 
5461	1413	way they bow at knee at mention of ANGLE name would make one wonder . 
5462	1413	Thank God , that it is not possible to bring GOD back , because , you may deny WAY , but I know lot of Teabaggers that worship ground GOD walks on . 
5463	1413	near ASPECT_INSTANTANEOU_GROWTH of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY after elections was because of `` fear and `` anger that `` black man was now at helm . 
5464	1413	And instantaneous support geared at ASPECT_PALIN -LRB- tea party fave -rrb- , is another indication that ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is not really interested in people who exercise frugality to reflect teabaggers conservatism , but rather in uses catchy phrases , made-up words and does not practice conservatism in people life . 
5465	1413	Your rantings are truly comical . 
5466	1413	There is none more incompetent than ASPECT_BUSH , and certainly McSame , who was not even able to tell state of economy when MCSAME was at point of collapse , nor ASPECT_BUSH caribou barbie who does n't even read newspapers and prides SOMEONE on foreign policy because thinks can see ASPECT_RUSSIA from back porch , can compare with ASPECT_OBAMA intelligence , eloquence and capabilities . 
5467	1413	is dream of right-wing fanatics of ASPECT_BUSH , because FANATICS would love for to replace ASPECT_BOZO in `` worst president category , unfortunately , MCSAME does n't look like MCSAME is going to happen . 
5468	1413	Already , ASPECT_OBAMA has been given accolades that ASPECT_BUSH does n't even know how to pronounce . 
5469	1413	ASPECT_OBAMA 15th greatest president funny that you should mention that , being ASPECT_BOZOBUSH is known for having taken time off than president . 
5470	1413	Vacationing ASPECT_BUSH sets record on Time Off would have been ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_OBAMA staff continues to work when ASPECT_BUSH is on vacation . 
5471	1413	RECORD is constant sniping and whining from `` right wears on BUSH , but ASPECT_BUSH is resilient enough to withstand that vitriol . 
5472	1413	And even if we lose seats in November , which is normal for party of sitting president , WE will still have majority - and Reps\/cons will still be whining and crying and saying `` wait till election ! 
5473	1414	He is showing wear because HE is deeply lost . 
5474	1414	In way over HE head . 
5475	1414	HE 's so far out of HE capability HE does n't even realize CAPABILITY , and is confused that works . 
5476	1414	And works because top , oBum , does n't know what HE is doing . 
5477	1414	And HE gang of YES men thugs only know ASPECT_CHICAGO payola and threats politics . 
5478	1414	Beyond THUGS he gets unworkable ideas from utopian dreamland far left . 
5479	1414	I 'd be surprised if HE is n't HAPPY to go in 2012 . 
5480	1415	Another person does n't know conventional way of posting ! 
5482	1415	You 've been listening to Faux news too long . 
5483	1415	Reps may take seats , but czars doubt reps will defeat . 
5484	1415	of tea partiers czars have seen interviewed do n't know up from down , think ASPECT_GLENN_BECK should be president , ASPECT_CLAIM_BARACK_OBAMA is in ASPECT_BIBLE as `` anti-christ , think ASPECT_OBAMA was to use term `` czars , are in support of Medicare , want abolished - Watch video - you 'll see how really ignorant and discombobulated are : YouTube - 9.12 dc tea party - MARCH FOOTAGE WITH ... works ? 
5485	1415	ASPECT_BECK got ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE reformed passed , that neither ASPECT_HW_BUSH , nor ASPECT_REAGAN , and certainly not ASPECT_BOZOBUSH were able to accomplish . 
5486	1415	Also , ASPECT_BECK passed finance reform . 
5487	1415	ASPECT_BECK was able to get unemployment extended in spite of selfish republicans who only want to give ASPECT_TAX_CUT to wealthy . 
5488	1415	So quit spewing lies , UNEMPLOYMENT makes your post look suspect . 
5489	1415	Now you are just venting venom and hate because you have of substance to offer . 
5490	1415	Republicans in ASPECT_CONGRESS have shown where WEALTHY loyalties lie , with very wealthy and corporations ! 
5491	1415	Are you contributing to bp fund - you know , one to help ASPECT_BP clean up mess contributing made so CONTRIBUTING wo n't have to spend of contributing millions and have to cut bonuses for contributing ceo ? 
5492	1415	Your republican congressmen would appreciate FUND if you would contribute . 
5493	1416	Everything you post is obvious that it is what left wing liberals have brainwashed you into thinking . 
5494	1416	you post shows original thought . 
5495	1416	REPUBLICAN challenged you to GO and research and learn for yourself . 
5496	1416	But instead you preach nytimes or msnbc line about ASPECT_TEA_PARTY . 
5497	1416	No ASPECT_PERSONAL_EXPERIENCE , no personal knowledge . 
5498	1416	You are lost in your ideology . 
5499	1416	You continue to say things about ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE and about ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY and republican former president . 
5500	1416	Regardless of FACT that REPUBLICAN have informed you that REPUBLICAN am not Republican . 
5501	1416	And REPUBLICAN did not vote for ASPECT_BUSH . 
5502	1416	You ask how to explain sign at tea party rally . 
5504	1416	1 called free speech . 
5505	1416	Right or wrong , 1 free speech . 
5507	1416	there have been proven instances of liberals attending ASPECT_TEA_PARTY rallies to cause trouble and to show ignorant signs . 
5508	1416	But you do n't know since you will only believe what leftist propagandists tell you to believe . 
5509	1416	But if you would go and SEE for yourself , you would see people displaying slurring signs being asked , in no uncertain terms to get out and stay out . 
5510	1416	And PEOPLE get out and stand in front of liberal cameras . 
5511	1416	And people know right where PEOPLE have liberal cameras . 
5512	1416	And seem to be on name basis with liberal media people . 
5513	1416	But smear campaign will fail because liberals are up against aroused ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC . 
5514	1416	Not self serving ideology . 
5515	1417	Just shows you that ASPECT_HARRY_REID is just another chameleon with no convictions . 
5516	1417	Yeah , and I already pointed out to you that of them do not want Mosque there either . 
5517	1417	We 'll see about . 
5518	1417	Dems believe that DEMS is living , breathing document . 
5519	1417	ASPECT_OBAMA said DEMS was `` charter of negative liberties . 
5520	1417	If you think dems respect Constitution , you have n't been paying attention . 
5521	1417	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is what ASPECT_AMERICAN should support , unless you like big government , bureaucracy , and taxes . 
5522	1417	I guess you would re-elect ASPECT_OBAMA no matter how much that one-man wrecking ball is destroying country . 
5523	1418	is intentional lie . 
5524	1418	Same as saying LIE is not community center . 
5525	1418	CENTER is community center AND mosque . 
5526	1418	So CENTER IS mosque . 
5527	1418	Saying center not mosque , community center is like saying ASPECT_CATHOLIC church is bingo parlor . 
5528	1418	Bingo gets played but is church , first and foremost . 
5529	1418	And fiasco in NY is mosque , first and foremost . 
5530	1420	is so true . 
5531	1420	They wo n't campaign on ASPECT_HCR , bailouts , or stimulus , because THEY know none of THEY are popular with People . 
5532	1420	just leaves what you mentioned : ASPECT_BUSH ... oh , and racist ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT . 
5533	1420	HOPE certainly hope THEY will not continue to campaign on `` hope and change because we can see where is getting WE . 
5534	1422	You just ca n't handle truth , so go ahead and do like reps , hide under rock and believe what Faux news tells you . 
5535	1422	were members of your `` so-called high falutin tea party expressing members dumbness . 
5536	1422	Sorry that you do n't see MEMBERS for what members are and try and tell FALUTIN that MEMBERS are informed Americans ! 
5538	1422	Yeah , yeah , FALUTIN know . 
5539	1422	of sudden people that voted for ASPECT_BUSH , do n't even know who ASPECT_BUSH is ! 
5540	1422	FALUTIN do n't blame you for trying to distance yourself from buffoon , BUFFOON really did n't do country good . 
5541	1422	Sure country free speech , is why racists are able to carry RACISTS racist signs and get free pass from rest . 
5542	1422	typical republican\/conservative response - blame Democrats , RACISTS infiltrated party and racists were ones with signs , right ! 
5543	1422	RACISTS capture country on video - FALUTIN do n't have to be there to see racist signs and RACISTS interview people , so FALUTIN can then hear people `` lost look and dumb answers . 
5544	1422	ASPECT_AMERICA is getting to see just how whacky Republicans have gotten . 
5545	1422	Really - now RACISTS are telling RACISTS people that Muslims are going to get RACISTS and kill RACISTS children - like boogy-man ! 
5546	1422	Is that way you can get votes ? 
5547	1423	Do you mean ASPECT_AMERICA has 60\/40 disapproval rating against ASPECT_OBAMA ? 
5548	1423	That ASPECT_AMERICA . 
5549	1423	Or 20 of Americans that trust Democrats ? 
5550	1423	That ASPECT_AMERICA ? 
5551	1423	ORAnd one is hilarious , ASPECT_AMERICA now sees 45 to 44 approval rating of ASPECT_BUSH over obie idiot . 
5552	1423	That ASPECT_AMERICA ? 
5553	1423	In ASPECT_USA we have 2 newspaper that lean right . 
5554	1423	rest are very to extremely leftist and do but run what amounts to commercials for liberal ideas . 
5555	1423	WE have one tv station that leans right , but does present side . 
5556	1423	All rest of TV is exactly like leftist newspapers . 
5557	1423	On radio there are some right leaning to very right wing talk shows . 
5558	1423	And can be said for left , there are more of them . 
5559	1423	So in media matters left dominates communication by than 20 to 1 . 
5560	1423	Maybe 100 to 1 . 
5561	1423	Yet , ASPECT_AMERICA , does not believe bill of goods left is selling . 
5562	1423	ASPECT_AMERICA hears your story 20 or times for time they hear story from right , yet THEY side with story from right . 
5563	1423	Is right more convincing , or is right simply pointing out what intelligent nation can see for NATION . 
5564	1423	You want respect from ASPECT_AMERICA ? 
5565	1423	Stop insulting they intelligence . 
5566	1423	THEY can see stupidity and unsustainability of your liberalism better than you can . 
5567	1424	If your opinion is based on following , I would suggest you stop reading ASPECT_FOX ASPECT_NATION and stop watching FOX News . 
5568	1424	Read news papers or fact-checking websites . 
5569	1424	Turn off ASPECT_CABLE_NEWS . 
5570	1424	He is less than half way into HE term and has already kept or compromised on 160 . 
5571	1424	81 are stalled either due to ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_OBSTRUCTIONISM -LRB- record fillibusters -RRB- or various reasons . 
5572	1424	majority are in works , and 22 have been outright broken . 
5573	1424	You lied . 
5574	1424	SOURCE : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.politifact.com \ \/ truth-o-meter\/promises \ \/ www.recovery.govwww.whitehouse.gove tc , etc. . 
5575	1424	I have never seen so information been made open to public by administration . 
5576	1424	is matter of opinion , and I get feeling judging by tone of your ASPECT_PREVIOU_POST that anything administration does will not please you . 
5577	1424	Oh really ? 
5578	1424	I guess never happened , then ? 
5579	1424	I guess ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY I get check is just figment of I imagination ? 
5580	1424	I guess credit when I filed I income tax year was illusion ? 
5581	1424	You lie . 
5582	1424	ASPECT_BUSH tax cuts sun-setting will not raise taxes on ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS under Democrat proposed plan . 
5583	1424	SUN-SETTING will only raise taxes on individuals grossing over 200,000 or families grossing over 250,000 . 
5584	1424	Do your homework . 
5585	1424	Also , stop lying . 
5586	1424	Saying LYING going to raise taxes on everyone is but your wistful thinking . 
5587	1424	Do n't peddle THINKING as fact . 
5589	1424	LYING has actually cut useless or wasteful ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_PROGRAM in order to save billion dollars here and there . 
5590	1424	I think you 're mistaking ASPECT_OBAMA with ASPECT_BUSH . 
5591	1424	Also , stop lying . 
5592	1424	Popular opinion is fickle and changes depending on who is better at communicating message . 
5593	1424	Republicans are notoriously good at doing so through emotionally charge rhetoric and propaganda . 
5594	1424	of us -LRB- I included -RRB- rely on facts to form ASPECT_US opinions rather than rhetoric , so while you may disagree -LRB- for whatever reason -RRB- with cost-saving measures such as insurance reform , are right to do both morally and financially . 
5595	1424	Yet again ... what hell ? 
5596	1424	ICE has actually deported people under ASPECT_OBAMA than PEOPLE did under ASPECT_BUSH , and ASPECT_OBAMA has only been in office for year and half . 
5597	1424	Where are you getting your `` facts from ? 
5598	1424	Far too vague for I to argue against . 
5599	1424	Far too vague for I to argue against . 
5601	1424	While HIM is n't anything like reincarnation of ASPECT_FRANKLIN ASPECT_DELANO ASPECT_ROOSEVELT that I was hoping for , I will certainly vote for him over Republicans field , unless teddy roosevelt ASPECT_REPUBLICAN comes out of woodwork . 
5602	1426	campaign promise has been filled you know ... according to clowns in ASPECT_WHITEHOUSE we are pulling out of recession . 
5603	1426	CLOWNS have clowns heads so far in sand with ears plugged saying ASPECT_LALALALA . 
5604	1426	I ca n't hear you ASPECT_AMERICA . 
5606	1427	Technically , they are correct . 
5607	1427	Until we see negative ASPECT_GDP_GROWTH for than 2 quarters in row , THEY will continue to assert as well . 
5608	1427	But with calculations changes for unemployment as well as change from GNP to GDP to track economy , figures have been much more forgiving for feds to report figures to ASPECT_GENERAL_PUBLIC . 
5609	1427	Still , does n't help public at all . 
5610	1429	Maybe you need to expand your knowledge , and turn on ASPECT_CABLE_NEWS and listen to talk radio . 
5611	1429	You only get warm fuzzies from ASPECT_MSM . 
5612	1429	Obstructing ASPECT_OBAMA is good . 
5613	1429	ASPECT_OBAMA has been forced to be more transparent , but ASPECT_OBAMA did n't start off way as promised . 
5614	1429	Just wait until 1\/1\/2011 , at which time taxes will be raised for everyone to cover ASPECT_HCR . 
5615	1429	tax brackets increase . 
5616	1429	OBAMA spending dwarfs cuts . 
5617	1429	Assuming goes well and stays on track ? 
5619	1429	deficits from ASPECT_OBAMA will be history-making . 
5620	1429	Obamacare was against wishers of People . 
5621	1429	want ASPECT_LOL repealed now . 
5622	1429	No thanks to ASPECT_OBAMA . 
5623	1434	typical liberal reasoning . 
5624	1434	Does n't really have meaning or substance . 
5625	1434	There I fixed it for you . 
5626	1435	Remember whole banning lobbyist from Admin ? 
5627	1435	did n't even last 1 day . 
5629	1436	typical liberal reasoning . 
5630	1436	Does n't really have meaning or substance . 
5631	1436	Are you trying to have reasonable and meaningful conversation with me ? 
5632	1436	Maybe you 're trying to ask ME why ME like ASPECT_OBAMA . 
5633	1436	Or maybe CONVERSATION that you 're puzzled by thinking YOU would most ASPECT_LIKELY_VOTE for YOU like now . 
5634	1437	I wanna know how he can take credit for combat troops leaving ASPECT_IRAQ . 
5635	1437	Troops are Troops . 
5636	1437	Engineer , ASPECT_INTEL analyst , Civic affairs , JAG or whatever still goes to Boot camp and learns form basic combat skills . 
5637	1437	GOES have to or GOES do n't get deployed .

5649	1444	He is not making unpopular decisions . 
5650	1444	HE is making ideological decisions do not and have not worked . 
5651	1444	decisions are unpopular because people do not share HE rigid ideology see them as stupid decisions . 
5652	1444	Like spending way to prosperity on borrowed money . 
5653	1444	Or , `` are going to win ASPECT_AFGHAN_WAR and leave year . 
5655	1444	If he was not both driven and bound by HE ideology , HE would react to problems instead of pushing old , old , tired program . 
5656	1444	Once again night , in HE speech , HE philosophizes with no specifics , and then promotes , regulation , education reform , and cap and trade . 
5657	1444	regulation = taxes ON EVERYONE . 
5658	1444	Reform education = taxes on everyone . 
5659	1444	Cap and trade = taxes on everyone . 
5660	1444	In case you have n't broken his code . 
5661	1445	Well ASPECT_DAN , instead of pointing finger , post your ideas ? 
5662	1445	We 're so quick to point finger & rack up points , but WE have no fvcking clue on how to fix things . 
5663	1446	Hundreds of ideas have been offered , by me , by others .

5671	1446	OBAMA also insults crippled wounded combat ASPECT_AMERICAN_HERO in completely hateful and arrogant manner .

5682	1448	Ah but I think you fail to see his true colors ! 
5683	1448	HIS has abandoned legal working middle class of ASPECT_AMERICANS completely knowing HIS has lost ASPECT_US by HIS broken promises and forcing HIS agenda upon us such as disliked atrocity called ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PLAN . 
5684	1448	Anyway look at who his is befriending ! 
5685	1448	illegal aliens which means hispanic voting block . 
5686	1448	And of course black voting block . 
5687	1448	I beleive that is calculated strategy and one will fail because votes are not there . 
5688	1448	I used to beleive as you until I began realizing that HISPANIC was ignoring wishes of voters over and over so times I began asking I why is HISPANIC doing ? 
5689	1448	So no hispanic is playing hispanic ace in hole and giving VOTERS everything voters want in desperate hope that VOTERS will win hispanic reelection imo . 
5691	1449	aEXCERPT ; Yes HE too wish we as nation were as loved as WE supposedly were in early 60 . 
5692	1449	HE read book from era was entitled how to go around world on pound of pot and backpack . 
5693	1449	ha ha was before ASPECT_NAM had really been in living rooms for long enough to poison world against WE JFK was in office and everyone seemed to love we or so was what HE have been told . 
5694	1449	But then ASPECT_NAM lasted ten years then there was bad things including ASPECT_CIA in ASPECT_SOUTH ASPECT_AMERICA and ASPECT_MIDDLE ASPECT_EAST wars . 
5695	1449	HE too thought ASPECT_OBAMA might change . 
5696	1449	But no he has been disappointment because man is about MAN . 
5697	1449	MAN only wants man vision of what MAN thinks ASPECT_USA should be , which seems to be semi or totally socialist country where everyone is dependent on government . 
5698	1449	No obama is toxic . 
5699	1449	HE beleive that man is threat to survival of nation . 
5700	1449	HE could explain why man trillion dollar here and trillion dollar there plans of flushing good money after bad will probably stop feeble recovery and maybe force into depression which will have world wide consequences . 
5701	1449	If ASPECT_USA really crashes in 1920s style depression -LRB- USA will be worse really -RRB- world will crash with . 
5702	1449	And then will really be hated ! 
5703	1449	\*\*\* -LRB- nervous ha ha ... -RRB- \*\*\* please forgive dark humor ... ?

5725	1450	Did else ? 
5727	1451	So he did n't sit in ASPECT_OVAL_OFFICE talking about it night ? 
5728	1452	Well I refuse to continually repeat I for slow . 
5729	1452	But you may search back and find I suggestions . 
5730	1452	's what words like , `` Hundreds of ideas have been offered , by ASPECT_YOU , by others . 
5731	1452	ideas HAVE been presented . 
5732	1452	If your memory is insufficient or you do not wish to look . 
5733	1452	is your choice .

5735	1452	I could not possibly care less what you say or `` think .

5740	1453	It was written because of ASPECT_WAY_AMERICAN were even then universally hated worldwide . 
5741	1453	And what we did to foster hate . 
5742	1453	Even in WWII when WE were staging in ASPECT_ENGLAND for d-day invasion of ASPECT_EUROPE , we good friends British said -LRB- in 1942-1944 -RRB- `` trouble with Americans is that WE are over sexed , over ASPECT_FED , and over here ! 
5743	1453	`` For over 150 years WE have been HAVES . 
5744	1453	And WE have not been shy about YEARS . 
5745	1453	Human nature should tell BRITISH that have nots are not going to appreciate WE .

5761	1463	I do n't have great deal of faith in politician no matter what party affiliation they claim . 
5762	1463	But Republicans have put forth dozens of suggestions since oBum took power . 
5763	1463	But liberal mindset is that if suggestion , or plan , does not fit DOZENS liberal ideology , not only is SUGGESTION ignored . 
5764	1463	DOZENS ignore MINDSET so completely , DOZENS act like , and CLAIM , that no suggestions were ever offered . 
5765	1464	's because , without exception , crap have offered amounts to simply of tired ass crap got us into mess ASPECT_US have now . 
5766	1464	problem with conservative ideology is that thinking for oneself is sin and anything says otherwise is deemed socialism and evil . 
5767	1464	See ^ ^ ^ ^ I can play stupid broad generalization game too . 
5768	1465	I rest I case ! 
5769	1465	Here is person can not name suggestions not proposed by liberal . 
5770	1465	And still backs liberal suggestions even tho in about 2 years -LRB- 4 years if you start with Democrat controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS in 2007 -RRB- NONE of liberal efforts have done anything but fail and waste money . 
5771	1466	Just because it happens on his watch , does n't mean HIS is taking credit for IT . 
5772	1466	HIS simply announced that ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR has ended . 
5773	1466	's WAR . 
5774	1466	had to make announcement , right ? 
5776	1466	If . 
5776	1466	had n't made public announcement , you 'd be flaming . 
5776	1466	for too . 
5777	1466	You just need reason to keep hating . 
5777	1466	. 
5778	1466	In my mind , no administration can fix problems . 
5779	1466	MY predict that one fans will be pointing FANS fingers at ASPECT_OBAMA for why FANS ca n't fix FANS either . 
5780	1467	Wow , where do you have your tent set up ? 
5781	1467	You are pyschic fortune reader right ? 
5782	1467	After , you arrogance to assume you know everything about me and me politics on basis of two short posts . 
5783	1467	Never mind , IDEOLOGUE are ideologue and as not worth time or effort time would take to educate you . 
5784	1468	You bob and weave well , , , obvious , but well . 
5785	1469	administration with open mind and balls to do MIND could fix problems . 
5786	1469	MIND would be painful for and so for politicians when problems are shown to be politicians fault . 
5787	1469	But NO , no administration will fix anything by following POLITICIANS ideological prejudice . 
5788	1470	Dems have plenty of fault to take blame for in getting us in mess also . 
5789	1470	So far , I have not seen anything from ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION that gives ASPECT_US glimmer of hope or change on horizon . 
5790	1470	ASPECT_OBAMA is spending ASPECT_US into oblivion . 
5791	1470	ASPECT_OBAMA `` Summer Of Recovery is big joke , and just wait until year when taxes increase . 
5792	1470	If ASPECT_OBAMA gets ASPECT_OBAMA way with Cap & trade and ASPECT_AMNESTY , ASPECT_US 're in for hurt . 
5793	1470	ASPECT_OBAMA is just too stupid to see obama destructive ways . 
5794	1470	I really believe ASPECT_OBAMA thinks ASPECT_OBAMA right in what ASPECT_OBAMA is doing . 
5795	1470	I do n't know what ASPECT_PLAYBOOK_OBAMA is using , but ASPECT_OBAMA had better close playbook and look at cover . 
5796	1471	I completely agree . 
5797	1471	And is why , even though at heart I disagree with liberal positions , I am not in favor of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY regaining power anytime soon . 
5798	1471	I like shakeup effect ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is having on republicans and I think party would benefit from stewing in REPUBLICANS -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- while longer . 
5799	1471	Maybe then , when REPUBLICANS start listening to republicans constituents again and start looking after interests of ASPECT_AMERICA rather than just lining CONSTITUENTS pockets , REPUBLICANS will be worth voting for again . 
5800	1471	Until then , I am likely to vote for ASPECT_OBAMA again as -LRB- as I stated in post just little ways back in here very thread -RRB- lesser of two evils . 
5801	1471	And no , I have not seen anything put forth by republicans lately was really worth consideration . 
5802	1471	REPUBLICANS seem to have based REPUBLICANS strategy on doing and saying whatever republicans think will obstruct and\/or tear down obama and ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY . 
5803	1471	When REPUBLICANS start acting in ASPECT_AMERICA interests rather than ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY interests , REPUBLICANS might become relevant again . 
5804	1472	I have never absolved democrats of blame . 
5805	1472	I just find it extremely hypocritical of republicans to claim democrats are solely responsible for mess country is in and particulary hilariously hypocritical why DEMOCRATS claim to be more fiscally responsible . 
5806	1473	Why do you say ? 
5807	1474	We know mess is fault of , including folks on sides of aisle . 
5808	1474	ASPECT_BARNEY_FRANK is big culprit , since ASPECT_FRANK was made aware of problems with freddie and fannie several years ago , but ASPECT_FRANK said were `` sound financial institutions . 
5809	1474	Boy was FRANK wrong . 
5810	1474	Also , `` fiscal responsibility and `` politicians is like `` oil and `` water . 
5811	1474	However , it is very clear that Dems and ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION are spending money politicians do n't have like DEMS grows on trees , or is being printed at ASPECT_BEP at record rate . 
5812	1476	ummm ... czars ? 
5813	1476	Firing auto CEO 's from ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE and handing over ownership of company to union ? 
5814	1477	ASPECT_OBAMA never planned on fixing anything for ASPECT_AMERICA . 
5815	1477	ASPECT_OBAMA_PRIORITY are redistribution of wealth , reparations domestically and internationally , implementing tenets of socialism , and helping ASPECT_MUSLIM_WORLD to expand . 
5816	1477	If anything , chaos and problems within ASPECT_AMERICA make CHAOS easier to slide things through , and ASPECT_OBAMA about , not making ASPECT_AMERICA stronger and less likely to accept ASPECT_OBAMA_PRIORITY . 
5817	1478	's exactly why maintain that he is destructive for ASPECT_AMERICA , HE is anything but american , and HE must not be re-elected .

5822	1480	's as irresponsible quote as DITCH have seen in conservative dead-head thread . 
5823	1480	DITCH can quote again and again irresponsible machinations that Republicans have thrust upon since Saint ASPECT_RONNIE ASPECT_REAGAN and come to fruition under bratboy ASPECT_BUSH , and not one conservative here or elsewhere will admit to and utter failure of `` trickle down war economics put in deep economic `` ditch 're now in . 
5824	1480	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN `` plan is `` just say NO !!!!

5832	1480	Like ASPECT_PALIN , women use neoconservative poison that drips from pen of ASPECT_WILLIAM ASPECT_KRISTOL . 
5833	1480	Talk about minion on ASPECT_SATAN team !

5836	1480	ASPECT_OBAMA has been in office less than 2 years and ASPECT_OBAMA supposed to clean up godawful mess years took ASPECT_REPUBLICANS 6 years and 2 wars to destroy economy and morale of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE . 
5837	1480	Now Republicans want voters to give VOTERS keys to economy once again to send jobs to ASPECT_CHINA , force Americans to die rather than get needed ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and make sure that quality education goes only to who can pay for EDUCATION , like voters billionaire cronies . 
5838	1480	Call Un-American ? 
5839	1480	You bet !!!

5851	1481	Firing auto CEO 's from ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE and handing over ownership of company to union ? 
5852	1481	What part of constitution is ASPECT_OBAMA_VIOLATING ? 
5853	1481	Was ceo successful , asked to leave and CEO said , sure ? 
5854	1481	CONSTITUTION not like bailout was given in time of prosperity . 
5855	1481	If there was n't problem we would n't be talking about . 
5856	1481	About bailouts -LRB- starting with ASPECT_BUSH in 2008 -RRB- if you 're concerned about ASPECT_HOMELAND_SECURITY , WE are in middle of war on fronts : would allowing chips fall where they may be smart to do for country ? 
5857	1481	And how would affect endless ways we interact with rest of world ? 
5858	1481	Giving tax payer money without conditions and management of what happens with money -LRB- who where and what money goes to -RRB- does n't make sense . 
5859	1481	MONEY would be worse than doing 
5860	1484	well said ! 
5861	1485	Not nearly as bad as Dems , and exactly what do you think current administration is doing ? 
5862	1485	Running up debt into astronomical amounts . 
5863	1485	You talk of `` pass ASPECT_BUCK_GENERATION ? 
5864	1485	Well , ASPECT_OBAMA is creating `` pass buck to generation . 
5865	1486	ASPECT_OBAMA restarted ASPECT_PAYGO_PROGRAM . 
5866	1486	ASPECT_OBAMA is talking about raising taxes after economy is recovered . 
5867	1486	ASPECT_OBAMA reformed healthcare system to save us hundreds of billions . 
5868	1486	And ASPECT_OBAMA is ending money pit is ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR . 
5869	1486	OBAMA doing great things for deficit . 
5870	1486	reason deficit is as high as DEFICIT is now is because REASON costs lot of money to fix mess so called conservatives left . 
5871	1487	You should put warning label on your posts . 
5872	1487	`` Too ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE and rational thought may cause cons heads to explode .

5880	1488	Already ASPECT_CBO says ASPECT_CBO will cost than BUREAUCRATS estimated . 
5881	1488	Democrat candidates for Nov. are avoiding mention of bho or obamacare . 
5882	1488	ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR is but small fraction of budget and difference between `` mission accomplished , and `` Combat is over , is word choice only . 
5883	1488	mission was not accomplished and combat is NOT over in ASPECT_IRAQ . 
5884	1488	And blaming EXCUSE on guy is completely worn out EXCUSE . 
5885	1488	And EXCUSE is purely EXCUSE for lack of accomplishment on BHO part . 
5886	1488	And what has BHO done for deficit ? 
5887	1488	BHO HAS increased national debt by 2.81 trillion in less than 2 years with ASPECT_BHO , and Democrat controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS , insane deficit spending . 
5888	1489	ASPECT_OBAMA started ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENTIAL_CAREER with 1.2 trillion dollar deficit . 
5889	1489	latest prediction is that 2010 deficit will be 1.3 trillion . 
5890	1489	's 100 billion dollar rise in deficit . 
5891	1489	Which is astonishingly low considering economy and unavoidable rise in deficits happens in recession due to increased welfare costs . 
5892	1489	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.salon.com \ \/ news\/feature\/20 ... dget_deficit_1In comparison by time in ASPECT_BUSH presidency ASPECT_BUSH raised deficit by 200 billion and ASPECT_BUSH was n't in recession . 
5893	1489	In words ... republicans are giant hypocrites . 
5894	1490	unemployment has not be rising for 14 straight months . 
5895	1490	MONTHS peaked year ago and has been lower ever since . 
5896	1492	His constitutional authority does not allow HIS to create shadow congress of czars , unelected and absolutely no oversight by but emperor emperor . 
5897	1492	HIS has no constitutional authority whatsoever to do anything with daily operations or ownership of private corporation . 
5898	1492	Yet HIS gave ownership to union donors , fired CEO that answers only to private board , and made decisions on which dealerships to close directly from ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE , favoring supporters and dems . 
5899	1492	Your excuses for are mind-numbing . 
5900	1492	essentially illegal , and without ASPECT_PELOSI , ASPECT_REID , and dem majority , impeachment would not be unrealistic . 
5901	1492	reid and holder have no constitutional authority to stop legal actions against club wielding thugs at voting precinct . 
5902	1492	AUTHORITY 's like out of ASPECT_CUBA or ASPECT_VENEZUELA . 
5903	1492	You 've got to be horrifically thick to try and pretend things away . 
5904	1494	Could n't have sung it better myself . 
5905	1494	MYSELF like sound of tune . 
5906	1494	Play !!! 
5906	1494	again , ASPECT_SAM !!! 
5907	1495	dr. ASPECT_OBAMA has never done anything unconstitutional . 
5908	1495	ASPECT_OBAMA_COHORT in ASPECT_LEGISLATIVE_BRANCH however continually find ways to violate Article 1 section 8 of ASPECT_USC . 
5909	1495	is why we are in economic mess today . 
5910	1496	I volunteer to take one for team and sleep with ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN . 
5911	1497	Oh , we sweetie pie tea party enthusiast , just like Mad hatter and in spite of your obvious paranoia , we `` love SPITE when you talk dirty ! 
5912	1497	needs !!!! 
5913	1498	Your rejoinder is claim by left wing website that he has 1.3 trillion deficit ?? 
5914	1498	If ASPECT_BUSH $ 1,2 trillion deficit was bad , AND BAD CERTAINLY was , how in hell is obummers 1.3 trillion deficit good ? 
5915	1498	And please , do n't claim DEFICIT Republican fault . 
5916	1498	lamo EXCUSE is totally worn out , and fact is Democrats have been IN CHARGE since jan. 2007 . 
5917	1498	Republicans were awful , and were REPLACED in nov. 2006 elections and Dems sworn in in jan 2007 . 
5918	1498	Or did n't you know . 
5919	1498	So truly awful republicans -LRB- no disagreement there -RRB- were replaced by Democrats who HAVE DONE WORSE ! 
5920	1498	ASPECT_PELOSI , and ASPECT_REID have been in ASPECT_CONGRESS for 20 + years and ASPECT_BIDEN even longer . 
5921	1498	What were they doing ? 
5922	1498	We NEED to dump career , and corrupt -LRB- -RRB- politicians of both parties . 
5923	1498	Republicans deserved to be replaced , AND WERE . 
5924	1498	Now Democrats are even deserving of being thrown out . 
5925	1498	Sadly that leaves Republicans to take Democrats place , and POLITICIANS are looking LESS evil than Dems . 
5926	1498	Both are BAD ! 
5927	1499	Pay her enough and HER 'll gladly accommodate seeking her favor . 
5928	1499	Just guard against STDs ! 
5929	1500	You wanna know why 1.3 trillion is good ? 
5930	1500	because when we had surplus g.w. cut taxes , increased spending , and took machete to regulations . 
5931	1500	When ASPECT_OBAMA took office right after http : \ \/ \ \/ www.youtube.com \ \/ watch ? 
5931	1500	gl = ASPECT_IE ASPECT_& ASPECT_H. . 
5931	1500	. 
5931	1500	& v = mEkY7_i7MJs . 
5932	1500	Now , instead of raising taxes when WE had surplus and economy was good , SURPLUS was thrown away , dribbled into haliburton and banks . 
5933	1500	Because ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT for rich expired 1.4 years into ASPECT_OBAMA term , it was meant to make ASPECT_BUSH look like ASPECT_BUSH was raising taxes in time in recession when in fact it was just ploy to make ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC president , whoever cut was look bad , because even ASPECT_BUSH knew after havic ASPECT_BUSH knew ASPECT_BUSH 'd create no republican would take office after HAVIC . 
5934	1500	So is ASPECT_OBAMA_PERFECT ? 
5936	1500	Was ASPECT_OBAMA dealt bad hand ? 
5937	1500	yes , YES had no where but down to go , and without spending for stimulous we 'd keep going down . 
5938	1500	Is ASPECT_OBAMA doing what truly needs to be done to fix we broken system of government feeding rich who gamle we money away ? 
5939	1500	no , but honestly ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_THINK ASPECT_REPUBLICANS would be even worse , historically speaking than man in office now . 
5940	1501	Maybe you have point . 
5941	1501	But , just `` maybe . 
5942	1501	If BOTH are BAD , what 's your solution ? 
5943	1501	Another party ? 
5944	1501	I 'll buy , but who do you recommend ? 
5945	1501	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY ? 
5946	1501	Not even ASPECT_OSAMA ASPECT_BIN ASPECT_LADEN would finance group of rattlesnakes -LRB- Do n't tread on I ! -RRB- 
5947	1501	and ASPECT_LADEN has incentive to do so since electing them is as electing laden . 
5948	1501	Sorry , dog wo n't hunt ! 
5949	1501	Seriously , if Republicans could muster `` ASPECT_AMERICAN candidate , as Independent , I might vote for him\/her . 
5950	1501	But , THEM got no one ! 
5951	1501	Republicans do is whine , complain , lie and say , `` NO ! 
5952	1501	Them 's facts , danny boy . 
5953	1501	Them 's facts ! 
5954	1501	They shot THEY in foot with bratboy ASPECT_BUSH -- or should I cite ASPECT_CHENEY as shooter ? 
5955	1501	Now , THEY can do is hobble around on crutches blaming ASPECT_OBAMA for they inability to run marathon without tea party help . 
5956	1501	Ohhhhhhhh , pain of NOW ! 
5957	1502	There is no ASPECT_TEA_PARTY like Democrat party or ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY . 
5958	1502	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is misnomer taken from ASPECT_BOSTON ASPECT_TEA_PARTY of history . 
5959	1502	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is NOT ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY . 
5960	1502	MOVEMENT is groundswell movement of diverse groups with things in common with one another . 
5961	1502	Out of control govt spending and ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT would be 2 complaints tea party groups have in common . 
5962	1502	How to fix things and , others are points of disagreement in various tea parties , same as are in society in general . 
5963	1502	Now have used name tea party for political purposes and gain . 
5964	1502	But ` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY ' is really dissatisfied ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC . 
5965	1504	No i wont , he does not have clue , never ran small business , which is prevalent in congress , NO have no idea what BUSINESS takes and how small business population creates jobs and invest in economy ... Just of , Democrats have been in power in congress since 2006 , NO persuaded ASPECT_BUSH to pass NO bills , look where BUSINESS has taken us ! 
5966	1504	ASPECT_BUSH got too mushy during BUSH four years with ASPECT_PELOSI in power , I wonder why ? 
5967	1504	ASPECT_US are screwed for quite sometime with economy , unfortunately ! 
5968	1504	Mostly because ASPECT_OBAMA is just doing , ASPECT_PELOSI must be quite convincing ... ASPECT_JOLLEEL 
5969	1505	if by groundswell you mean fox news movement then yes ... years are going to suck , but reps have no one right now . 
5970	1505	ron paul 2012 ? 
5971	1506	I agree with Dan40 , he has defined ground roots movement ... ASPECT_JOLLEE 
5972	1507	IF YOU truly believe that single cable tv station can sway thinking of nation while media outlets are condemning ASPECT_FOX and presenting completely different scenario , YOU , like most liberals have drank your kool-aid until you are blind , deaf , and dumb -LRB- as in stupid -RRB- One ASPECT_CABLE_STATION , and EVERYONE does not have cable , has power than media combined ??? 
5973	1507	You are being completely silly and illogical . 
5974	1507	TRUTH is that nation is fed up with miserably incompetent , corrupt ASPECT_CHICAGO cabal running ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE . 
5975	1507	And TRUTH IS disgustingly obvious to with working minds that obummers ideological nonsense `` fixes have not worked and will not work . 
5976	1507	of nation , but kool-aid drunken liberals , can see and know is FACT of ASPECT_USA_TODAY . 
5977	1507	And IF you truly believe what you 're saying , then nov. elections are going to be much , worse for liberals and is not good . 
5978	1507	When Republicans win and LIBERALS WILL , NOV. should only be by tiny margin , otherwise LIBERALS can go just as crazy as liberal democrats did . 
5979	1507	Republicans will win in Nov. but we 've got to have LIBERALS think LIBERALS 're on thin ice too . 
5980	1511	Do n't forget to kill ASPECT_AMERICAN_JOB and help along outsourcing . 
5981	1511	are ASPECT_REPUBLICAN ideals . 
5982	1512	November coming friend ! 
5983	1512	DemWits have really been in charge of ASPECT_CONGRESS since 2006 ... . 
5984	1512	Four years of crap , can cause significant damage , ASPECT_BUSH was too nice to ASPECT_NANCY ASPECT_PELOSI , big spender ... Jollee 
5985	1513	ASPECT_JOLLEE , your right and they know RIGHT , THEY also know THEY voted for war . 
5986	1513	Not to mention screwing economy with they great house give way . 
5987	1513	Nowthey admit , , , Oh people could not afford homes ... DUH !!!! 
5988	1513	How did people finally figure that out ? 
5989	1513	My god small business man like MY has seen poor do dumbest things time and time again . 
5990	1513	MY have had to sit with clients -LRB- car ins -rrb- , and tell CLIENTS . 
5992	1513	Dont get my wrong my will make money if you buy new mercedes , , , but but , , YOU could not make payments on your 98 chevy , , how are you going to do , , , -LRB- answer time -RRB- ... ... ... Gee dave , MY have no idea ... are very people Government is not smart enough to figure out , 's down right scary . 
5993	1513	Know what ? 
5994	1513	, MY dont think PEOPLE are dumb , everything Dems do keep people in poverty . 
5995	1514	My guess is that when Dems get whoppin in Nov. . 
5996	1514	ASPECT_DNC will DUMP ASPECT_OBAMA and start looking for viable candidate for 2012 . 
5997	1514	Already Dems up for re-election are treating obama like CANDIDATE has Plague . 
5998	1514	CANDIDATE shows up for fund raiser and local candidate is `` out of town . 
5999	1514	DEMS POTUS , and candidate is `` out of town ? 
6000	1514	Now THAT `` s funny ! 
6001	1514	fund raising dinners with obama have had prices dropped by 90 + and one they gave tickets away to fill joint . 
6002	1514	is guy you want to vote for . 
6003	1514	guy political hacks do n't want anything to do with GUY . 
6004	1514	GUY will go down in history as longest president was `` lame duck . 
6005	1514	`` GUY came in Messiah , GUY 's going out Pariah ! 
6006	1516	ASPECT_BUSH 8 years of crap on ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC . 
6007	1516	Maybe YEARS 's that ASPECT_REPUBLICAN math you 're using ... emotional but rational . 
6008	1518	ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH !!! 
6009	1518	ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH !!! 
6010	1518	ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH !!! 
6011	1518	Since January 2007 , PARTY has been ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY in control of congress and spending . 
6012	1519	ASPECT_OBAMA is not following ASPECT_PAYGO_PROGRAM . 
6013	1519	ASPECT_OBAMA wants to raise taxes now , before ASPECT_ECONOMY_RECOVER , Obamacare will do anything but save money , and ASPECT_OBAMA is doing things to increase deficit . 
6014	1519	has happened so far will save us money , was draw-down of ASPECT_IRAQ . 
6015	1519	However , of expense is just being shifted to ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN . 
6016	1519	reason deficit is getting so high , is because ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_OBAMA_DEMOCRATIC_GOON are spending ASPECT_US into oblivion . 
6018	1521	of ASPECT_CURRENT_DEFICIT came from programs were started prior to 2007 . 
6019	1521	Like ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR and ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
6020	1522	's not good . 
6021	1522	still bad . 
6022	1522	IS good is that he is moving up at slower rate and is passing policies will eventually drive deficit down . 
6023	1522	I gaurantee ... mark I word ... that 2011 deficit will be lower than 1.2 trillion HE started with . 
6024	1522	Because democratic policies and democratic policies lower deficit . 
6025	1522	If you want deficit is higher than 1.2 trillion dollars then vote ASPECT_REPUBLICAN in 2010 and 2012 . 
6026	1522	Because 's republicans are good for . 
6027	1523	ASPECT_OBAMA has not proposed program of raising taxes before recovery is over . 
6028	1524	He 's letting ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT expire . 
6029	1524	HE may agree to keep them in place for ASPECT_MIDDLE ASPECT_AMERICA , however , but small business will suffer . 
6030	1524	ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE come into play on 1\/1\/2011 due to Obamacare . 
6031	1524	Cap & trade : ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE , energy increases = increase in cost of goods and services . 
6032	1524	Report : ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE on oil and gas would cost thousands of jobs : ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA proposed tax increases on oil and ASPECT_GAS_COMPANY would cause over 154,000 workers to lose thousands jobs , according to new report by ASPECT_LOUISIANA state university economist dr. ASPECT_JOSEPH ASPECT_MASON . 
6033	1524	report also finds that ASPECT_OBAMA proposal would reduce economic output by 341 billion and create over 68 billion in lost wages nationwide . 
6034	1524	`` Though politicians think POLITICIANS are selectively targeting ` Big oil ' with energy tax proposals , POLITICIANS would actually devastate thousands of small ASPECT_AMERICAN businesses nationwide as well as workers who depend on POLITICIANS , ASPECT_MASON said in prepared remarks . 
6035	1524	`` With at least 150,000 u.s. jobs at stake in fields ranging from healthcare to estate 150,000 clear that cost of repealing section 199 and dual capacity far outweigh potential benefit of increased government revenues may be derived from proposal . 
6036	1524	`` ASPECT_OBAMA recently proposed paying for ASPECT_OBAMA 50 billion plan to improve country infrastructure system by increasing taxes on oil and gas industry . 
6037	1524	ASPECT_MASON points out that if ASPECT_CONGRESS follows through on mason plan , effect might be worse than mason calculations because mason estimates do not include how individual investors would be affected by ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE . 
6038	1524	Source : http : \ \/ \ \/ thehill.com \ \/ blogs\/on-the-mone ... s-to-lose-jobsLieberman throws cold water on ASPECT_OBAMA tax proposal : Writers on left end of spectrum seemed buoyed by would-be speaker ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_BOEHNER statement over weekend that ASPECT_OBAMA_PARTY could , in fact , support ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BARACK_OBAMA and Democrats on partial extension of bush-era tax cuts . 
6039	1524	ASPECT_OBAMA_POSITION - one endorsed back home by members of ASPECT_CONGRESSIONAL delegation and candidates like Attorney general ASPECT_RICHARD ASPECT_BLUMENTHAL - is that income tax cuts should be extended for people making less than 250,000 per year , as well as for businesses . 
6040	1524	cuts would be allowed to expire as scheduled would be on people making 250,000 per year or , or roughly 2 percent of taxpayers . 
6041	1524	ASPECT_TPM has exchange , from `` Face nation : bob schieffer : `` SCHIEFFER want to make sure schieffer heard what you said correctly : YOU 're saying that YOU are willing to vote for middle class ASPECT_TAX_CUT , even though bill will not include ... extending ASPECT_TAX_CUT for upper bracket ASPECT_AMERICAN . 
6042	1524	rep. boehner : `` Bob , YOU do n't know what bill 's going to say , alright ? 
6043	1524	If option boehner have is to vote for at 250 and below , of course boehner 'm going to do . 
6044	1524	But ASPECT_BOEHNER 'm going to do everything boehner can to fight to make sure that YOU extend current tax rates for Americans . 
6045	1524	`` certainly looks like President winning game of chicken with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN minority , especially given that democratic members of ASPECT_CONGRESS -LRB- rep. ASPECT_JOE ASPECT_COURTNEY , for example -RRB- have lately sounded resigned to likelihood that MEMBERS will have to vote to extend cuts , even on rich , since doing would result in hiking taxes on ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS . 
6046	1524	And since Republicans , by simply folding members arms and saying no to anything but full slate of ASPECT_TAX_CUT , would force Democrats to choose between extending boon for multimillionaires or delivering and handing multimillionaires opponents another club to use in fall campaigns . 
6047	1524	Why would ASPECT_BOEHNER blink ? 
6048	1524	Perhaps because , as with so issues in year , ASPECT_SENATE will carry day . 
6049	1524	Today , here 's sen. ASPECT_JOE ASPECT_LIEBERMAN , ASPECT_REGISTERED_DEMOCRAT who makes lot of registered democrats see red , explaining that ASPECT_LIEBERMAN 'll be holding out for ASPECT_BOEHNER is : extending cuts for everybody . 
6050	1524	: http : \ \/ \ \/ www.theday.com \ \/ article\/201009 ... 0403\/100919940 
6051	1528	FACT ASPECT_ECONOMIC_FACT that poor and ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS put money into economy faster than rich . 
6052	1528	rich do put lot in savings . 
6053	1528	They invest too but investments do n't always see THEY trickling down to ASPECT_COMMON_MAN . 
6054	1528	Hell there is no guarantee that money is going to ASPECT_AMERICAN interests . 
6055	1528	THEY could be investing in company based in ASPECT_LONDON or ASPECT_CHINA . 
6056	1528	Plus in environment where demand is low ... like ... in recession ... THEY are n't going to risk money to expand operations when demand does n't warrant RECESSION . 
6057	1528	We gave rich ASPECT_TAX_CUT and instead of growing WE lost millions of jobs . 
6058	1528	But when WE raised taxes on MILLIONS and cut taxes for ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS and gave middle class temporary work millions spent ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY . 
6059	1528	Now demand is up . 
6060	1528	Businesses are profiting again . 
6061	1528	And ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR is hiring . 
6062	1528	SECTOR clear which strategy works and which does not . 
6063	1529	What brainwashed BS . 
6064	1529	Economies grow through INVESTMENTS , not through spending . 
6065	1529	And ASPECT_JOB_GROWTH under dummy obum has been in govt jobs . 
6066	1529	Since OBUM was elected ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOB are ASPECT_NET_LOSS . 
6067	1529	And if taxes are increased on people making over 250,000 . 
6068	1529	LOSS will bring 2011 deficit down from 1.27 trillion to 1.07 trillion -LRB- cbo -rrb- loss will TAKE 200 billion out of economy and put LOSS in hands of politicians , where loss WILL BE mostly wasted . 
6069	1529	reduced govt spending by mere 5 and we would be in place and 200 billion would stay in economy where SPENDING can do good . 
6070	1530	Actually group of jobs growing right now is ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR . 
6071	1530	government is laying people off because of census ending . 
6072	1530	And we 'll be just fine with raised taxes . 
6073	1530	WE already have rediculiously low taxes . 
6074	1530	Here is concept . 
6075	1530	WHY DO n't we PAY BILLS !? 
6076	1531	ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOB are growing SLIGHTLY right now . 
6077	1531	What I said is ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOB are ASPECT_NET_LOSS under incompetent one . 
6078	1531	He BLEW 814 billion on failed stimulus , and immediately after STIMULUS passed , HE IGNORED economy for over year in order to concentrate on horrendous bill ever passed in history of country , obummercare . 
6079	1531	And is constantly distracted by tiny minor issues like cop and prof in ASPECT_MASS. or sherrod fiasco , which was 100 COP fault . 
6080	1531	And distractions like ASPECT_OIL_SPILL go unnoticed for months before COP can find time for them . 
6081	1531	COP can not handle full plate all at once . 
6082	1531	COP has decision making process can only kindly be called ` confused , ' and COP has n't clue how to judge people . 
6083	1531	white house staff has 41 people owing Govt over 800,000.00 in unpaid taxes , and ASPECT_TREASURY_SECRETARY could n't figure out COP individual taxes . 
6084	1531	You say , `` WHY DO n't we PAY BILLS !? 
6085	1531	How about put that 800,000 . 
6086	1531	in treasury or cut govt jobs and get people in there with integrity and honor .2012 ca n't come too soon to bid good riddance to idiot . 
6087	1532	You have to wonder whether cognitive dissonance among conservative friends will lead to mass neurosis . 
6088	1532	In one minute deficits and debt are worst problems in world , but when presented with plan to reduce deficits by increasing revenues , friends blow fuse . 
6089	1533	He ignored economy by passing 800 billion stimulus to stimulate economy ? 
6090	1533	See point re : mass neurosis in ASPECT_ABOVE_POST . 
6091	1534	STIMULUS did not stimulate , and was ignored since day he signed STIMULUS . 
6092	1534	From then on then complete agenda was passing unwanted and unwise ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL , while economy was ignored . 
6093	1534	`` stimulus still has BILLIONS unspent year and half later . 
6094	1534	How does STILL `` stimulate if STILL is not spent ? 
6095	1534	And why does THEN need `` ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY when 40 &#37; of STIMULUS is still on books ? 
6096	1534	IF MONEY was good idea . 
6097	1534	And IF MONEY was emergency . 
6098	1534	WHY is more needed when `` emergency funds have yet to `` stimulate anything and remain UNSPENT ?? 
6099	1534	Asking questions of administration does not EVER make sense is not neurosis , ADMINISTRATION is responsibility of citizen . 
6100	1534	Even govt that DOES make sense should be questioned by responsible citizenry . 
6101	1534	But liberals ca n't stand questions since you have no logical , provable answers . 
6102	1535	Thank for sharing your opinions . 
6103	1535	You 've already made them clear . 
6104	1535	I disagree with THEM for reasons stated mulitple times . 
6105	1535	I never suggested neurosis was questioning administration . 
6106	1535	But in screeching about deficits while at time going apoplectic over plan to reduce THEM . 
6107	1536	Since obama is deficit spending at highest rate in history . 
6108	1536	If fact outspending about 95 of history . 
6109	1536	I have to say that whatever plan is to reduce deficits , PLAN is not working . 
6110	1536	While there is very little chance that ASPECT_REPUBLICAN incumbents will do anything to reduce ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT . 
6111	1536	There is absolutely NO chance whatsoever that Democrats will do anything to reduce debt . 
6112	1537	There has been no plan to reduce deficits to point . 
6113	1537	Only to keep economy from going into another great depression . 
6114	1537	There is to gauge whether economy working . 
6115	1537	Increasing ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE would be step in right direction . 
6116	1537	What ASPECT_REPUBLICAN plan ? 
6117	1538	Dozens have been offered , that DOZENS bounce off your closed liberal mind is not issue . 
6118	1538	have been offered . 
6119	1538	does not mean I believe . 
6120	1538	Same as I did not and do not believe sincerity of statement made year by ASPECT_POTUS , one ASPECT_BARAK_OBAMA when ASPECT_POTUS said `` You DO NOT raise taxes in recession . 
6121	1538	It was politically expedient lie when POTUS said SINCERITY year and potus insistence on raising taxes on people making over 200,000 , or households making 250,000.00 is politically expedient lie now . 
6122	1538	statement POTUS thinks will help POTUS politically , POTUS will utter . 
6123	1538	No matter how potus believes LIE to be lie or not . 
6124	1538	POTUS knows brain damaged liberals will believe LIE because POTUS says LIE . 
6125	1538	Republicans will not believe POTUS . 
6126	1538	Conservatives will not believe POTUS . 
6127	1538	But best of INDEPENDENTS have reached wiser point of no longer believing potus . 
6128	1538	And independents is where votes are . 
6129	1539	You can act like your for ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS , but if your not for ASPECT_JOB_CREATOR in economy your not for middle class jobs ! 
6131	1540	CUTTING spending is step in right direction . 
6132	1540	You liberals grant oBum excuse that he had to spend like HE does . 
6133	1540	Well excuse could be made in minute , by politician in 50 years and more . 
6134	1540	`` pet agenda of theirs is ALWAYS ` necessary . 
6135	1540	` We already have 50 too federal govt NOW . 
6136	1540	step one is to cut back , along with massive expense too Govt generatesThe average private sector job , where 100 of we goods are produced , pays 63,000 . 
6137	1540	with benefits . 
6138	1540	average federal employee job , where is produced , pays 121,000 . 
6139	1540	with benefits . 
6140	1540	should make job obvious to EVEN liberal that cutting Govt is better way to go than taxing ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR . 
6141	1540	Since ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR already has to pay cent of 121,000 . 
6142	1540	Federal largess . 
6143	1541	So you are -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ing about deficits , but wo n't support raising revenues to reduce .

6146	1542	`` 63K to 121K and you want to give them money ? 
6147	1542	typical liberal lunacy AND BULLSH ! 
6148	1542	TI am 100 for having revenues to support Govt . 
6149	1542	As soon as Govt is reduced to proper size , we can increase taxes for express purpose of paying down debt . 
6150	1542	Increase taxes without decreasing Govt , and WE will ONLY get spending . 
6151	1542	They 're spending money they do n't HAVE like drunken sailors . 
6152	1542	What would THEY do with money ?? 
6153	1542	Increase federal revenues by 10 and THEY 'll spend 12 than now . 
6154	1542	CUTS FIRST , then we 'll KNOW what taxes NEED to be . 
6156	1543	`` Cut spending . 
6157	1543	Being hearing that from conservatives for 3 decades . 
6158	1543	conservatives talk but never do HEARING . 
6159	1543	There is n't one -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- conservative politician today who is saying where CONSERVATIVES 're going to cut 500 billion in spending . 
6160	1543	In meantime keep ASPECT_TAX_CUT and keep running up debt . 
6161	1543	All that conservative whining about deficits is but hypocritical political horse -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- . 
6162	1544	Says who is on food stamps\/bridge card . 
6163	1544	Why do n't I pay your bills instead of having pay for them . 
6164	1544	I find PAY comical you are -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ing about others paying THEM bills when you do n't even pay yours . 
6165	1544	typical liberal college kid . 
6166	1545	I do pay I bills . 
6167	1545	And I am proud I am on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP . 
6168	1545	Otherwise I would n't be able to afford to bring business to I local brewery . 
6169	1545	ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP help economy . 
6170	1546	So you are worried about buying beer ? 
6172	1546	Receiving ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP is not paying your bills . 
6173	1546	-LRB- taxpayer -rrb- is . 
6174	1546	You should be thanking taxpayer . 
6175	1547	Thank you , taxpayers . 
6176	1547	By funding food stamps program you help me not only afford to eat but use me money elsewhere to support small local businesses . 
6177	1547	Which include breweries and video game stores . 
6178	1547	extra businesses now have me money when TAXPAYERS would n't have before . 
6179	1547	Thanks to you taxpayers 
6180	1548	AND there is n't one liberal politician does n't want to increase taxes ON EVERYONE and increase spending on everything . 
6181	1548	Do n't you ever notice my signature ? 
6182	1548	We have to get politicians out of politics . 
6183	1548	term limits are NECESSARY for survival of country . 
6184	1548	POLITICIANS of both parties got WE where WE are . 
6185	1548	WE need constant change of people to get WE out . 
6186	1549	Change is n't always good . 
6187	1549	change we took in 2000 was disaster . 
6188	1550	And then we went from bad to worse in 2008 . 
6189	1550	is also what is currently on plate . 
6190	1550	Blame bush ai n't working out so well anymore for one-trick-pony dopes , now is NOW . 
6191	1551	2000 was bad , but warm up to disaster of 2008 . 
6192	1552	Yup , I noticed that too . 
6193	1554	ASPECT_BUSH was president in 2008 . 
6194	1554	I agree 2008 went from bad to worse . 
6195	1554	Things started turning around in 2009 . 
6196	1555	Yup , I noticed that too . 
6197	1555	ASPECT_OBAMA was elected in 2008 , not 2000 . 
6198	1555	Check your history books . 
6199	1556	but stimulus is wearing out and soon economy and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET will both be heading south ! 
6200	1557	Sure . 
6201	1557	When `` soon ? 
6202	1558	Your assumptions are incorrect . 
6203	1558	I was commenting on and agreeing with your sentence , not your second . 
6204	1558	hint could be found in I quoting your sentence , not your second . 
6206	1559	You are spending else 's money on needs . 
6207	1559	You are spending your money on things you do n't need -LRB- wants -RRB- . 
6208	1559	You are justifying taking money so you can buy beer and video games , classic liberal . 
6210	1560	I am justifying getting ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP so I can afford to buy things other than just food . 
6211	1560	As I am helping economy more than I would be if I was n't on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP and ASPECT_SPENDING_MONEY on food . 
6212	1560	I have great pride in I decision to get ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP because I am helping ASPECT_AMERICA get back on track . 
6213	1560	If of nation poor took advantage of government assistance programs designed specifically for them then then even businesses would benefit . 
6214	1560	Demand would go up . 
6215	1560	And businesses would be forced to expand to make up for new demand . 
6216	1560	Which means jobs which ultimately means less people dependent on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP . 
6217	1560	ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP also allows I to be independent from I parents . 
6218	1560	Who ca n't afford to take care of I . 
6219	1560	Which means PARENTS too can spend money on things like paying off parents mortgage so parents do n't become another foreclosure statistic . 
6220	1560	Thank god food stamps exist so that people like I who struggle with academics and require lots of time studying can afford to go to school and eat at time . 
6221	1561	What rationalizing bullcrap , You are doing for economy . 
6222	1561	money you 're using to buy things `` other than food is not doing anything extra for economy . 
6223	1561	Because earned money AND right to spend MONEY as they wished , but it was taken from THEY in form of taxes to buy ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP for you . 
6224	1561	As my signature says , 2 people spending one person money DOES NOT help economy . 
6225	1564	I quoted wrong post LOLYou are sounding like non-believers thought ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE would go on forever ! 
6226	1565	true but mass hysteria also creates crises and positive people live longer anyway ... PEOPLE just do n't have as money ... 
6227	1566	Instead of taking ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP and then spending your time surfing web explaining how in round about way you are helping economy , you could simply go out and get job . 
6228	1566	My parents said PARENTS could n't afford to keep MY under parents roof forever , so MY decided to go to college so MY could get job and MAKE ASPECT_MY_MONEY . 
6229	1566	There is no way you can say that getting job and then spending money from job is not helping economy . 
6230	1568	Not at . 
6231	1568	I had opportunities by buy estate in 2005-07 time frame and would n't touch ESTATE . 
6232	1568	You are sounding like non-believers think gold bubble will go on forever ! 
6233	1569	ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP would n't exist if REASON did n't benefit businesses . 
6234	1569	's whole reason we still have ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP . 
6235	1569	To allow we poor to spend money on things POOR would n't be able to afford otherwise at minimal cost to businesses . 
6236	1569	I am indeed helping economy 
6237	1570	I 'm glad you could handle ASPECT_FULL_TIME_JOB and full time school at time . 
6238	1570	I can not . 
6239	1570	When I tried I GPA plummeted . 
6240	1570	job at fast food place is n't as important to I as getting through college . 
6241	1570	So I choose not to work . 
6242	1570	Just like plenty of college students . 
6243	1570	And there is wrong with PLENTY . 
6244	1570	government will be taking way more in taxes from I after I graduate than amount I get in ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP . 
6245	1570	Also I would not be able to get through college without assistance . 
6246	1570	Which means I would n't be able to make high salary I plan to achieve after I graduate . 
6247	1570	Which means government would be missing out on hundreds of thousands of ASPECT_TAX_DOLLAR during I career . 
6248	1570	So yes . 
6249	1570	on factors getting ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP is helping economy . 
6250	1570	Not only business end but END is helping END to gain revenue in future . 
6251	1571	And thanks to ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP I can afford to go to college to get high salary job which will have ASPECT_HIGH_TAX which will be used to pay for college kid ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP . 
6252	1571	JOB ASPECT_ECONOMIC_FACT that money is pumped into economy thanks to ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP than program money costs . 
6253	1571	's why there is n't politician in right mind suggesting we get rid of JOB . 
6254	1571	conservatives who do n't understand how economics work . 
6255	1573	lot of truth in . 
6256	1573	Like things , LOT matter of incentives . 
6257	1573	Politicians have incentive to give people what POLITICIANS want and ASPECT_AMERICAN consistently want than people can afford . 
6258	1573	As long as politicians are allowed to borrow money , inevitable result is short term patches , snowballing debt , and eventual crash . 
6259	1574	You really think ASPECT_TAX_DOLLAR `` pumped into economy would n't have been spent had government not forcibly taken them from people in order to give you privilege of spending else 's money ? 
6260	1574	reason politicians do n't shut down type of forced charity is not because of greater economic good , GOOD because voters want free ride than are being abused by tax system . 
6261	1574	POLITICIANS keep TYPE going to get votes , stay in office , and collect unearned paycheck . 
6262	1574	You can , but odds are you wo n't . 
6263	1574	fact that height of your ambition is to get salary rather than trying to really make impact on economy suggests you 'll never pay enough in taxes to even equal what you take out of government less help else . 
6264	1575	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_FACT that money is pumped into economy thanks to ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP , than program costs . 
6265	1575	is not only blatant lie , LIE is also impossible . 
6266	1575	LIE can not pump anything IN after program took money OUT of economy . 
6267	1575	Believe liberal bullsh ! 
6268	1575	if you wish or make up nonsense as you go along . 
6269	1575	I went to college working 2 jobs , 1 full time , 1 part time . 
6270	1575	AND had wife and 2 kids . 
6271	1575	No ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP , no welfare , we provided we help . 
6272	1575	WELFARE called personal responsibility and pride , or at least WELFARE used to be . 
6273	1575	But I 'm guessing you do n't really know anything about . 
6274	1576	He does n't . 
6275	1576	IF money were truly that big of issue to HE HE would go to cheaper college and save money . 
6276	1576	I 'm tired of liberal bullsh ! 
6277	1576	that `` I ca n't work because I need time to study . 
6278	1576	's bunch of non-sense . 
6279	1576	There is always plenty of time to study . 
6280	1576	Also , once you get job and go to school , you find ways to better manage your time I have realized . 
6281	1576	But , of course , he needs money for video games 
6282	1577	Back in days there were times when I was dead dog tired . 
6283	1577	I had 2 sayings that I would repeat in I head . 
6284	1577	One from I Dad , `` you carry in YOU head , less YOU 'll have to carry on YOU back . 
6285	1577	And one of my , `` you do , YOU can do . 
6286	1577	`` And with age , YOU 've found that opposite of mine is also true , `` you sit , YOU have to sit . 
6288	1578	You 're wrong . 
6289	1578	ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP do benefit economy .

6292	1578	Wealth just moves TREND way up and once ONCE gets there ONCE does not come back down . 
6293	1578	Wealthy business owners only spend enough to make money . 
6294	1578	OWNERS do not hire just because OWNERS have ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY lying around . 
6295	1578	Because if OWNERS did OWNERS might lose money if OWNERS are more productive than OWNERS demand warrants . 
6296	1578	So money gets put in bank . 
6297	1578	Or inheritance fund . 
6298	1578	Or place where FUND just sits and makes money on interest or dividends . 
6299	1578	Sure of PLACE might `` trickle down but PLACE goes up times faster than PLACE comes down . 
6300	1578	ASPECT_INCOME_TAX was designed from start to balance issue out . 
6301	1578	TAX was designed to take money from who are n't spending TAX and are instead hording TAX to make money for . 
6302	1578	money then goes to programs to assist lower income families . 
6303	1578	Whether through food , education , healthcare , or just putting little ASPECT_EXTRA_MONEY in families pockets . 
6304	1578	in turn creates consumers , which means demand , which forces employers to hire , which makes businesses sell product . 
6305	1578	SYSTEM delicate economic system ensures everyone gets piece of pie . 
6306	1578	might get bigger pieces but at least everyone is eating pie . 
6307	1578	system keeps economy healthy . 
6308	1578	Taking taxes away only insures rich get richer and poor gets poorer . 
6309	1579	I 'm glad you could . 
6310	1579	MAN 're better man than I . 
6311	1579	I had two choices . 
6312	1579	Work job and still make barely enough to feed I while watching I GPA drop below 2.5 ... or focus I efforts on school get on ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE and watch I GPA go to 3.3 . 
6314	1579	choice is clear . 
6315	1579	3.3 is way nicer gpa . 
6316	1579	And I 'm not going to sacrifice so I can make ASPECT_MINIMUM_WAGE when I 'm doing just fine living off food stamps and loans . 
6317	1579	It means I 'll be in debt when I get out of school . 
6318	1579	But I 'll have easier time finding job because of I GPA and fact that I had time to be president of student organization . 
6319	1580	I went to community college for 2 years to get I gen eds out of way for basically free -LRB- state paid I way -RRB- . 
6320	1580	And I am currently enrolled in one of cheapest 4 year universities in state . 
6321	1581	And ASPECT_BUSH and obum both have spent like drunken idiots and economy is in perfect shape for IDIOTS ASPECT_GOVT_SPENDING . 
6322	1581	Liberals are lunatics think can be made from . 
6323	1583	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- ASPECT_MOD_EDIT : Insult removed -rrb- -RRB- -RRB- To liberals , disagreement with obummer FAILED policies and obvious incompetence as leader and thinker means without doubt opponent is RACIST . 
6324	1583	's you got . 
6325	1583	I 've got continuing flat economy . 
6326	1583	continuing ASPECT_HIGH_UNEMPLOYMENT . 
6327	1583	continuing avoidance of issues . 
6328	1583	continuing poor hiring . 
6329	1583	continuing poor housing sales . 
6330	1583	continuing growing foreclosures . 
6331	1583	And continuing disapproval by MAJORITY of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC . 
6332	1583	ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC elected him has suddenly become RACIST ? 
6333	1583	You people are lost in worthless dreamland . 
6334	1584	I never realized we could get to point that person could make charity sound like they are doing WE favor , , HOLY crap !!!! 
6337	1585	When ASPECT_BUSH left office in January of 2009 , nation wide unemployment was 7.2 percent and average price of gallon of gasoline in ASPECT_USA was about 1.65 . 
6338	1585	After spender-n-chief ASPECT_OBAMA took oath of office nation wide unemployment peaked over 10 percent in October not to mention fact that 2 + million jobs lost under blueneck president . 
6339	1585	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA : Chains we can believe in ! 
6340	1586	When ASPECT_BUSH left office economy was tanking at -7 rate and net 700,000 jobs were being lost month . 
6341	1586	conservative friends could find hilarious . 
6342	1587	One of perverse assertions I 've ever heard , too often repeated by who are unable to earn lifestyle they demand . 
6343	1587	More accurately , wealth moves from consume much and produce little to consume less less than produce . 
6344	1587	is n't flaw in capitalism , FLAW is n't about money getting `` stuck . 
6345	1587	FLAW happens because participants in economy provide insufficient value to earn money but feel PARTICIPANTS have right to spend ECONOMY . 
6346	1587	Arbitrarily taking wealth from who deliver value and gifting flaw to who do n't does n't balance out inherent flaw in capitalism , FLAW masks and excuses failure . 
6347	1587	failure is n't that citizens are `` hording dollars , FAILURE 's that others are failing to provide anything worth dollars others covet . 
6348	1587	If you truly think economy is best served by maximizing consumption at expense of productivity , explore extreme of your theory . 
6349	1587	If wealth was collected weekly under single tax and then evenly redistributed -- how would economy fair ? 
6350	1589	Did ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC ASPECT_NATIONAL ASPECT_COMMITTEE take poll ? 
6351	1589	Because NO independent polls are saying anything like . 
6352	1591	You do n't really understand anything about economics , do you ? 
6353	1591	ASPECT_OBAMA took office , and economy was in free fall . 
6354	1591	reason we got 10 &#37; unemployment has absolutely to do with ASPECT_BARRACK_OBAMA . 
6355	1591	As I said , economy was already in free fall . 
6356	1591	But was not only ASPECT_BUSH fault . 
6357	1591	FAULT was culmination of 30 years of bad economic policy beginning with ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN , continuing through ASPECT_HW_BUSH and ASPECT_CLINTON , and ultimately ending in ASPECT_BUSH administration . 
6358	1591	Poor policy enacted by ASPECT_FEDERAL_RESERVE also played major role . 
6359	1591	So if you truly believe ASPECT_OBAMA had anything to do with causing unemployment to go to 10 you are delusional and so incredibly partisan that WASTE is waste of I time to even write post . 
6360	1591	But if you are capable of thinking critically , you will realize is nonsense , and try to actually evaluate policy independently and intelligently . 
6361	1591	Then if you wanted to blame ASPECT_OBAMA for fact that economy has not recovered more quickly -LRB- OBAMA could certainly have done more -RRB- , or fact that ASPECT_OBAMA reformed ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE without actually making ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE affordable and accessible for average person , or ASPECT_OBAMA has failed to competently regulate banks , etc then I would say you certainly have point . 
6362	1591	But if you want to blame ASPECT_OBAMA for recession was already happening before ASPECT_OBAMA took office , you are going to have to be incredibly dishonest . 
6363	1592	ASPECT_NEWSWEEK_POLL August 25 - 47 of voters approved of how ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is handling ASPECT_OBAMA_JOB , 45 of voters disapproved .

6371	1596	But rather on what MY know to be fact that oBum constantly lies . 
6372	1596	Both by commission and by omission . 
6373	1596	And also what MY know about leadership and rating employees performance . 
6374	1596	And pres IS employee of people . 
6375	1596	MY consider EMPLOYEE fired , but rules say EMPLOYEE has thru 2012 to vacate . 
6376	1596	And ASPECT_REAGAN methods were ASPECT_POLAR_OPPOSITE of ASPECT_CLOWN_AND were showing signs of improvement in spite of 100 negative press AND 20 inflation . 
6377	1596	ASPECT_RR did n't even have ASPECT_FOX to present positive view . 
6378	1596	Now `` incompetent one has media but ASPECT_FOX acting as cheerleaders for ASPECT_FOX and still is working . 
6379	1596	Unless you consider 54 jobs , `` created or saved in ASPECT_LA AT COST OF 111 million . 
6380	1596	MY 'm fairly certain that at 2 million per job , my pet cat could save bunch of jobs . 
6381	1596	If oBum faced 20 inflation now , even seiu might have marched on WH by now and thrown WH out . 
6382	1597	ASPECT_RASMUSSEN_REPORT , which may be little right leaning does approval and disapproval AND strongly approve and strongly disapprove . 
6383	1597	Daily results , today approval of obama 45 disapproval 55 Strongly approve of ASPECT_JOB_OBAMA is doing 27 strongly disapprove of ASPECT_JOB_OBAMA is doing 45 Altho I have been polled by ASPECT_RASMUSSEN and I could not detect bias one way or another in questions . 
6384	1597	And I was looking for DAILY . 
6385	1598	Can you link to single source says stimulus workers are being paid 2 million per job ? 
6386	1599	-RRB- facts show that ASPECT_OBAMA does n't constantly lie . 
6387	1599	is your biased opinion . 
6388	1599	You do n't agree - fine - Politifact says otherwise . 
6389	1599	-RRB- I have n't seen evidence you know anything about leadership or employeesc -RRB- No President is not employee of people . 
6390	1599	If anything employee is employee of Constitution or ASPECT_UNITED_STATE of ASPECT_AMERICA . 
6391	1599	people do n't have right to fire President - ASPECT_CONGRESS has right . 
6392	1599	`` PRESIDENT consider EMPLOYEE fired , but rules say EMPLOYEE has thru 2012 to vacate . 
6393	1599	`` Clearly you consider Constitution to be inconvenient document . 
6394	1599	`` And ASPECT_REAGAN methods were ASPECT_POLAR_OPPOSITE of ASPECT_CLOWN_AND were showing signs of improvement in spite of 100 negative press AND 20 inflation . 
6395	1599	`` ASPECT_REAGAN got plenty of good press - reporters loved ASPECT_REAGAN . 
6396	1599	And yes economy was showing signs of imporvement - as is YOU current economy . 
6397	1599	`` RR did n't even have ASPECT_FOX to present positive view . 
6398	1599	`` Yeah , imporvement love how you spin ASPECT_FOX as balancing act . 
6399	1599	ASPECT_FOX is just propaganda arm for ASPECT_RNC - pretty as ASPECT_MSNBC is for ASPECT_DNC . 
6400	1599	People were saying pretty much stuff about ASPECT_REAGAN at point , and STUFF turned around . 
6401	1599	Saint ASPECT_REAGAN started off with screwed up economy and was there for turn around . 
6402	1599	ASPECT_OBAMA started off with screwed up economy and will be here for turn around too . 
6403	1599	But if ECONOMY has n't turned around - well then voters can vote ASPECT_OBAMA out of office . 
6404	1599	how things are done via Constitution . 
6405	1600	I 'm sure he would if HE made claim . 
6406	1600	Either you misunderstood or are trying to twist words were n't said . 
6407	1600	I 'm sure former was former 
6408	1601	No he claimed we spent 111 million on 54 jobs . 
6409	1601	HE would like to see source says WE spent 111 million on 54 jobs . 
6410	1601	Not WE spent 111 million on 54 jobs and oh yeah we bought brand new infrastructure too . 
6411	1601	HE want source says WE spent 2 million per job . 
6412	1602	LA got 111 million in ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY and they saved or created 54 jobs is exactly what I said and is exactly case . 
6413	1602	Nowhere at time did I say was being PAID 2 million . 
6414	1602	Read what la says , not what you 'd prefer ASPECT_LA said . 
6415	1602	FROM la times , acknowledged far left publication : `` As ASPECT_TIM ASPECT_CAVANAUGH noted previously , ASPECT_L.A. &#8217; s comptroller has issued two briefs indicating that two city agencies have so far managed to create just 55 jobs with 111 million in ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY . 
6416	1602	Now los angeles times follows up , noting that worry , according to comptroller , is that agencies are not spending money fast enough : `` report comptroller heard was 54 jobs , la times says 55 jobs , close enough for COMPTROLLER . 
6417	1603	Jollee , ASPECT_CALIFORNIA 
6418	1604	So in words stimulus was used to pay for infrastructure cost 111 million dollars . 
6419	1604	reasonable price . 
6420	1604	Infrastructure improves economies by giving business efficient commerce routes . 
6421	1604	money is n't JUST for jobs . 
6422	1604	And you are bending truth for your political agenda . 
6423	1604	Once again . 
6424	1605	Here you go ... http : \ \/ \ \/ controller.lacity.org \ \/ stellen ... TYP_011644 . 
6424	1605	pdf 
6425	1606	Another gullible persons swallows ASPECT_FOX news disinformation hook line and sinker . 
6426	1606	Read couple pages and see how you 've been mislead by ASPECT_FOX . 
6428	1606	If you care . 
6429	1607	Here you go ... See how you 've been deceived by ASPECT_FOX -LRB- again -RRB- ? 
6430	1607	They made you think that 111 million was spent and 55 jobs created . 
6431	1607	What really happened is bulk of money has been allocated , but not spent , and is waiting for projects to be OKed , then money will be spent and over 230 people put to work . 
6432	1607	When you 've been deceived by source over and over again , at what point do you stop gullibly accepting anything over say as if SOURCE were word of Lord ? 
6434	1609	ASPECT_OBAMA has cut taxes . 
6435	1609	ASPECT_OBAMA did n't set sunset provisions in ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
6436	1609	ASPECT_BUSH was President when happened and ASPECT_OBAMA was not even in ASPECT_SENATE when ASPECT_BUSH signed SENATE into law . 
6437	1609	I 've searched all through government websites and have not found anything called `` Obamacare . 
6438	1609	But , health care reform law that ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA signed will slow growth of ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_COST for country and will help reduced deficit spending . 
6439	1609	's assuming big spenders in ASPECT_GOP do n't gain control of government . 
6440	1609	Which shows what failure ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_GOP are on national defense and budget issues . 
6441	1609	SPENDERS start war in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN as WoT , then -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- near stop wot to start war on ASPECT_IRAQ , had at to do with terrorism or ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEFENSE , then allowed al qaeda\/taliban to grow strong after having SPENDERS on run . 
6443	1609	Almost third of deficits can be attributed to ASPECT_BUSH policies , another third to ASPECT_BUSH recession\/financial implosion lowering ASPECT_ECONOMIC_ACTIVITY and tax collections . 
6444	1609	And third in fixing damage left behind . 
6445	1610	Would you be so kind as to list of us federal govt programs have become deeply involved in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR and have reduced , controlled , or slowed increase of costs . 
6446	1610	You may use programs from 1776 until today and list as or as as you wish . 
6447	1611	SUPPORTER am not supporter of obama or ASPECT_OBAMA_HEALTH_CARE_BILL , but to answer your question SUPPORTER 'd argue that ASPECT_POST_OFFICE is one example . 
6448	1611	year , SUPPORTER sit down with carriers from ups and fedex to hammer out agreement for shipping in coming year and existence of ASPECT_POST_OFFICE as inferior but sufficient fall back option keeps ever rising costs from both companies in check in way that competition between two does not . 
6449	1611	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM could have provided similar inferior but sufficient ASPECT_HEALTH_SERVICE for citizens had similar effect on ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_INDUSTRY . 
6450	1611	Sadly , got Obamacare instead . 
6451	1612	According to us govt accounting office , ASPECT_NOT ASPECT_FOX , not ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , not right wing media or publication . 
6452	1612	LOSSES for ASPECT_USPS in 2008 2.8 billion , 2009 3.0 billion , and 2010 looks to be worse . 
6453	1612	So whatever savings you THINK you 're getting by playing ASPECT_USPS off private carriers , is more than offset in taxes needed to support failing usps . 
6454	1612	But probably , than govt office , ASPECT_USPS is trying to be competitive . 
6455	1612	But in business world , trying to be competitive , but failing , meant bankruptcy . 
6456	1612	Now if you 're well connected , NOW means bailout . 
6457	1612	If not well connected , bankrupt . 
6458	1613	Yes , but it is good for consumers , because it increase competition and decrease shipping cost so IT facilitates business overall . 
6459	1613	means money is getting in to treasury . 
6460	1614	ASPECT_OBAMA was part of 2006 Democrat majority in ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
6461	1614	You fail . 
6462	1615	You must mean one started in 2007 , and not 2006 . 
6463	1616	elected in 2006 . 
6465	1616	But of course yes only voted present on most things so I guess you could say that YES had to do with PRESENT . 
6466	1617	They were n't officially majority until January 3 , 2007 . 
6467	1618	vitriolic is indicative of your argument . 
6468	1618	You just do n't have one . 
6469	1618	You did not answer single question put to you . 
6470	1618	Perhaps , your story is as inappropriate as your response . 
6471	1618	With , I have difficulty believing your story . 
6472	1618	ASPECT_GLEN_BECK has troubled past , narcissistic mentality and tendency to make up BECK facts . 
6473	1618	I suggest of beck ` following ' are infected with disease . 
6474	1619	Which questions have been put to me that ME have not answered ?? 
6475	1619	And ME have never watched single glen beck program in its entirety . 
6476	1619	ME have tuned in to ASPECT_BECK just as ME have tuned in to ASPECT_CHRIS ASPECT_MATTHEWS . 
6477	1619	And ME have never watched complete matthews show either . 
6478	1619	ME do not base anything me say on statement by ASPECT_GLEN_BECK , unless unknowingly so , since ASPECT_BECK is on daily and has hours and hours to say things that ME do not know ASPECT_BECK said . 
6479	1619	But can you cite single made up fact that ASPECT_BECK has said ? 
6480	1619	Not contrary opinion , but provable fact , showing that ASPECT_BECK lied ? 
6481	1619	There may be many , there may be few , there may be none , ME do not know . 
6482	1619	But since you made statement , ME assume you have FACTS , not opinions , to back up your statement . 
6483	1619	DO YOU ? 
6484	1620	always freaks out when people say ASPECT_GLENN_BECK had troubled past , when ASPECT_OBAMA did too , with Cocaine and broken family unit ... ASPECT_JOLLEE 
6485	1622	right if you learn from your mistakes it make you stronger better person . 
6486	1622	exception are are not willing to learn ! 
6487	1623	ASPECT_OBAMA is still spending like ASPECT_PARIS hilton without having way to pay for WAY . 
6488	1623	minor tax cuts may have been made will be overshadowed very soon . 
6489	1623	beginning of year will bring on slew of ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE . 
6490	1623	repeal of Obamacare will save us all from world of hurt . 
6491	1623	If you think that REPEAL will be good for ASPECT_AMERICA , then you just have proved yourself one of ASPECT_OBAMA_SHEEPLE heading for cliff with blinders on . 
6492	1623	ASPECT_US need strong ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEFENSE . 
6493	1623	Sure ASPECT_OBAMA did n't start wars , but they are happening . 
6494	1623	ASPECT_IRAQ has been drawn down , and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN is being built up . 
6495	1623	ASPECT_US can not just pull out now . 
6496	1623	ASPECT_BUSH is at fault for everything . 
6497	1623	ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_BUSH . 
6498	1623	FAULT ASPECT_BUSH fault . 
6499	1623	economy is ASPECT_OBAMA child now . 
6500	1623	ASPECT_BUSH is history . 
6501	1623	ASPECT_OBAMA is and will do damage to economy than ASPECT_BUSH ever had . 
6502	1624	I hope so ! 
6503	1624	TIME time we start paying bills . 
6504	1624	Good for ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY does not equal good for ASPECT_AMERICA . 
6505	1624	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY should not be allowed to deny pre existing conditions . 
6507	1624	war in ASPECT_IRAQ made us less safe . 
6508	1624	There is no disputing that . 
6509	1624	war thined out us resources and allowed alqaeda to get stronger than NO were on 9-11 . 
6511	1624	ECONOMY is ASPECT_OBAMA economy now . 
6512	1624	And ECONOMY improving economy . 
6513	1624	Unlike economy on ASPECT_BUSH day . 
6514	1624	was ASPECT_BUSH economy . 
6515	1624	And economy was crashing so hard that people were talking about ECONOMY like ECONOMY was going to be great depression . 
6516	1624	If ECONOMY was n't for ASPECT_OBAMA quick actions economy would have been . 
6517	1625	You do n't pay bills . 
6518	1625	You do n't work . 
6519	1625	You get ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_MONEY for college . 
6520	1625	You have ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD . 
6521	1625	Do n't talk to us about paying bills ... Since you do n't contribute . 
6523	1625	COMPANIES are ASPECT_PRIVATE_COMPANY . 
6524	1625	Why should n't COMPANIES be able to choose who THEY insure , you know people COMPANIES are putting companies money on line for . 
6525	1625	Sure , keep drinking kool-aid . 
6526	1625	What has improved about economy at all ? 
6527	1625	Just one ... debt is increasing in ASPECT_RECORD_NUMBER . 
6528	1625	unemployment rate is still at 9.6 , RATE about to go up again in winter . 
6529	1625	1\/6 of Americans -LRB- including you -RRB- are on ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE . 
6530	1625	recession has now turned into depression . 
6531	1625	How is economy improving ? 
6532	1625	-LRB- \ \/ quote -RRB- We are in depression right now . 
6533	1625	See above . 
6534	1625	about economy has improved since ASPECT_OBAMA took office . 
6535	1625	has improved since democrats took over ASPECT_WASHINGTON almost 4 years ago . 
6536	1625	Keep drinking kool-aid . 
6537	1625	KOOL-AID must have nicotine in KOOL-AID because you seem so addicted . 
6538	1625	Again , what did ASPECT_OBAMA do to improve economy is still going downhill ? 
6539	1625	Spend like maniac ? 
6540	1625	Unemployment rate going up ? 
6541	1625	Extending un-employment ? 
6542	1626	public has to spend less , but Govt can spend and tax more . 
6543	1626	And you think is good situation ? 
6544	1626	WHY do ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY deny coverage for pre-existing conditions ? 
6545	1626	because companies KNOW companies will have to pay for treatment of condition , and COMPANIES also know from experience what treatment will cost . 
6546	1626	So COMPANIES have 3 choices , 1 . 
6547	1626	Turn down known expensive since is contrary to idea of insurance . 
6548	1626	-LRB- which you should research -RRB- 2 . 
6549	1626	Charge that person premium ASPECT_HIGH_ENOUGH to cover higher expenses companies will occur . 
6550	1626	or 3 . 
6551	1626	charge everyone higher premium for extra expenses one person WILL have . 
6552	1626	And choices 1 , 2 , and 3 , have been REGULATED by law for of your lifetime and oversaw by govt employees . 
6553	1626	ASPECT_BLS -- ASPECT_EMPLOYMENT_SITUATION -- AUGUST 2010the of unemployed persons -LRB- 14.9 million -RRB- and unemployment rate -LRB- 9.6 percent -RRB- were little changed in August . 
6554	1626	From May through August , thejobless rate remained in range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent . 
6555	1626	of persons employed part time for economic reasons -LRB- sometimes re-ferred to as involuntary part-time workers -RRB- increased by 331,000 over themonth to 8.9 million . 
6556	1626	individuals were working part time because theirhors had been cut back or because THEIRHORS were unable to find full-time job . 
6557	1626	THEY ARE not counted as unemployed ! 
6558	1626	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.bls.gov\/news.release\/empsit.t08.htmT his table of statistics from ASPECT_BUREAU ASPECT_OF ASPECT_LABOR_STATISTIC shows us employment situation to be be unchanged from August 2009 through August 2010 . 
6559	1626	`` growing economy does not show completely STAGNANT employment for YEAR ! 
6560	1626	WAKE UP ! 
6561	1626	But UP is not stagnant , housing sales and prices are down and foreclosures are UP . 
6562	1626	And yesterday , b.o. gave little hint that MASTER was ready to DUMP master `` economic advisors . 
6563	1626	And since MASTER is absolute master of `` Blame else , YESTERDAY does n't seem `` recovery is recovering . 
6564	1627	You will have to ` splain me how losses of 8,800,000,000.00 over 3 years has PUT money in ASPECT_TREASURY . 
6565	1627	Start with FACT that 8.8 billion came OUT of treasury , not in . 
6566	1628	ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE means lower deficits . 
6567	1628	And you think is bad situation ? 
6568	1628	SITUATION may have been regulated , but not to protect who are victims . 
6569	1628	If you have prior you did n't get insurance . 
6570	1628	ASPECT_BLS -- ASPECT_EMPLOYMENT_SITUATION -- AUGUST 2010the of unemployed persons -LRB- 14.9 million -RRB- and unemployment rate -LRB- 9.6 percent -RRB- were little changed in August .

6574	1629	I contribute by getting through college with decent gpa so that I can get hired by computing firm one day and be part of higher tax brackets contribute money . 
6575	1629	government is getting more out of I on ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP through future taxes they will collect from I because I was able to graduate college and was n't forced to focus juggle work and school . 
6576	1629	people might be able to juggle school and work . 
6577	1629	Kudos to people . 
6578	1629	But I ca n't . 
6579	1629	I 've tried several times . 
6580	1629	time ends with I failing classes . 
6581	1629	They do n't get to choose who lives and who dies . 
6582	1629	If THEY do then TIME time to reconsider health system . 
6583	1629	No company should EVER have power to deny healthcare coverage . 
6584	1629	Especially when COMPANY is in life or death situations often apply to preexisting conditions . 
6585	1629	I drink plenty of kool-aid thanks to I ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP job losses have turned to job gains . 
6586	1629	GDP has grown consecutively since early summer 2009 , stocks have been on rise . 
6587	1629	We 're not 100 but WE are on rise . 
6588	1629	's what improvement is . 
6589	1629	On rise . 
6590	1629	Moving up . 
6591	1629	Things are n't going down they are going up . 
6592	1629	We 're not even in recession . 
6593	1629	How could WE possibly be in depression ? 
6595	1630	freaking gop dog catcher could beat ASPECT_OBAMA_RIGHT now . 
6596	1630	I would n't care what party ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_OBAMA_GOD awful ASPECT_NANCY ASPECT_PELOSI type supporters are ! 
6597	1630	SUPPORTERS trillion dollar here two trillion dollar there stupidity is bringing down nation faster than radical islamo-fascist terrorists brought down twin towers . 
6598	1630	Impeach obama for ASPECT_SWI . 
6599	1630	-LRB- stupidity while In office -rrb- . 
6601	1631	Wishful thinking ... ASPECT_OBAMA is still top dog . 
6602	1631	Do n't think just because you can beat congress on mid term election that you can beat ASPECT_OBAMA . 
6603	1631	I 'd be willing to put money on ASPECT_OBAMA winning in 2012 . 
6604	1633	we know that whenEVER one party is in power , revenue only means spending . 
6605	1633	IF Govt would START by actually cutting spending , ASPECT_AS ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC ASPECT_HAS ASPECT_TO ASPECT_DO , Govt might find reasonable attitudes to raising taxes . 
6606	1633	But when we KNOW that giving them money means waste , WE have no interest in feeding THEM addiction . 
6607	1633	THEM have to learn to live on less as WE do . 
6608	1633	Insurance is now regulated before obamacare and was before b.o. was born . 
6609	1633	regulations on pre-existing conditions are to PROTECT healthy millions from high costs of sick . 
6610	1633	Is VERY good for healthy millions ? 
6613	1633	Is very tough on sick with pre-existing conditions ? 
6614	1633	Sadly yes . 
6615	1633	Life is tough , no regulation will ever or can ever change . 
6616	1633	However it is only have not had group insurance are in danger of pre-existing exclusions . 
6617	1633	If one has group policy and changes jobs , new insurer has had to cover THOSE as long as have had `` CREDIBLE coverage for 18 months before changing carriers . 
6618	1633	is and was law . 
6619	1633	Same as lifetime coverage limits . 
6620	1633	For ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY to set approval-able rate , REQUIRED by law , have to know what EXPOSURE is . 
6621	1633	So if CAP is 2 million lifetime cap , insurance company knows max exposure and knows what factor to add in to premium to cover . 
6622	1633	are standing laws before birth , wherever BIRTH was , of obummer . 
6623	1633	Now ASPECT_OBAMACARE_BILL stops pre-existing exclusions and lifetime caps . 
6624	1633	Meaning 100 certain that premiums WILL go up . 
6625	1633	they already ARE GOING UP !! 
6626	1633	UNEMPLOYMENT is down 1\/2 percent ??? 
6627	1633	From May through August , thejobless rate remained in range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent . 
6628	1633	`` And in reality has stayed in range for than year . 
6629	1633	So ASPECT_BLS , not ALREADY , says you do n't know what YOU 're talking about . 
6630	1633	Fluctuating between 10 and 9.5 is FLUCTUATING , not going down . 
6631	1633	Or is liberal math ? 
6632	1633	10 MINUS 9.7 equals 1\/2 percent ? 
6633	1633	Not in world . 
6635	1634	They 're pretty stable and at very winable considering numbers top ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE for 2012 are getting . 
6636	1635	poll pitting obummer against ASPECT_REPUBLICAN , said oBum would lose . 
6637	1635	OBUMMER started at 65 approval and began losing as is normal . 
6638	1635	But as time went on and OBUMMER became more and more revealed as both arrogant without reason to be arrogant , AND sadly incompetent at time , obummer approval fell down to obummer sheeple base of about 46 . 
6639	1635	was over year ago . 
6640	1635	Slowly of sheeple base has been opening eyes and over year OBUMMER has slowly gone down to 42 . 
6641	1635	After nov. obummer WILL drop into 30 and then OBUMMER is finished . 
6642	1635	Even Democrat national committee will then acknowledge OBUMMER as ASPECT_EMPTY_SUIT in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE . 
6643	1635	Democrats already see . 
6644	1635	Are you aware that almost universally , Democrats running for re-election are avoiding mention of obummer or obummer policies . 
6645	1635	They 're trying to make THEY look like pseudo-Republicans . 
6646	1636	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN always does better than specific ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
6647	1636	Because no two republicans can agree on what it means to be ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
6648	1636	There are ron paul libertarians . 
6649	1636	There are moral right ASPECT_CHRISTIAN conservatives . 
6650	1636	younger progressive conservatives . 
6651	1636	And everything in between . 
6652	1636	When you put ASPECT_OBAMA up against specific ASPECT_REPUBLICAN candidate obama generally wins . 
6653	1637	is not true . 
6654	1637	Beginning with dem tax increase in 1993 , ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE grew far faster than economy . 
6655	1637	Spending however , grew much slower than economy , trend continued thru 20001 . 
6656	1637	is difference between conservative and liberal . 
6657	1637	conservative says you have pre-existing condition ? 
6658	1637	Tough just get sick and die . 
6659	1637	liberal says everyone shares risk . 
6660	1637	We are Americans . 
6661	1637	's why 'm proud to be liberal . 
6662	1637	Unemployment rate : oct 2009 10.1 aug 2009 9.6 http : \ \/ \ \/ www.bls.gov\/webapps\/legacy\/cpsatab1.htm 10.1-9 .6 = 0.5 or 1\/2 . 
6663	1637	stand by post . 
6664	1638	pre-existing condition is presented CONDITION before you chose to have insurance . 
6665	1638	person applying for insurance for pre-existing condition is taking no risk , they know THEY will use services THEY are asking to receive at discount . 
6666	1638	cost savings to THEY will be paid for by others , who risked buying insurance without knowing if THEY would develop need . 
6667	1638	conservative asks why did n't you buy insurance before you developed condition when we could share risk ? 
6668	1638	liberal answers because I did n't want to risk I money , I 'd rather have you take care of I . 
6669	1638	's why I 'd be embarrassed to be liberal . 
6670	1639	is not necessarily true at . 
6671	1639	is idea behind insurance . 
6672	1639	liberal answers I had IDEA and lost I job or was dropped by I carrier . 
6673	1639	conservate answers then go ahead and die . 
6674	1639	's why I 'd be ashamed to be conservative . 
6675	1640	Then you have no problem . 
6676	1640	When you lost your job you chose COBRA to continue your coverage or you bought new insurance when you were dropped by your carrier . 
6677	1640	In either case , you had uninterrupted coverage and so your current carrier does not consider your current ailment as pre-existing condition . 
6678	1641	I think you are confusing ideas of insurance and charity . 
6679	1642	I 'm not . 
6680	1642	purpose of insurance is to spread risk among population . 
6681	1643	purpose of insurance is to TRANSFER risk to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY in exchange for premium . 
6682	1643	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY are FOR PROFIT organizations . 
6683	1643	-LRB- I realize that words , FOR PROFIT , are very confusing for liberals . -RRB- 
6684	1643	It means that LIBERALS MUST take in money in premiums than LIBERALS pay out in claims and operating costs . 
6685	1643	It also means that LIBERALS must keep premiums at sellable amount . 
6686	1643	It is not necessary for you to believe that , but AMOUNT is absolutely true . 
6687	1643	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY COULD insure anybody , or everybody , for everything . 
6688	1643	But NO one would be able to afford premium companies would HAVE to charge in order to be profitable . 
6689	1644	Then you 've definitely confused them . 
6690	1644	As I pointed out , person you are describing has no risk . 
6691	1644	person liability is certain . 
6692	1644	You are not spreading out risk , you are simply spreading person definite cost to others . 
6693	1645	I think YOURSELF 're getting little ahead of yourself Then you should be proud and happy to pay for your utopian liberals dreams , yourself , -LRB- LITTLE called charity -RRB- without bothering of us who know your dreams are impracticable and unworkable , and unsustainable , and ASPECT_US do not wish to waste ASPECT_US resources on stupidity does not work . 
6694	1645	In disaster , TRIAGE , is done because DISASTER does greatest good for greatest . 
6695	1645	TRIAGE is FACT of everyday life too . 
6696	1645	Not everyone is going to make FACT . 
6697	1645	is FACT , your liberalism is dream . 
6698	1645	In your words : `` oct 2009 10.1 aug 2009 9.6 `` ahhh , your do n't know how to break to you gently , so YOUR 'll just say OCT . 
6699	1645	its September 2010 AND UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL AT PLACE !!!! 
6700	1646	No one said anything about ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY , but insurance . 
6701	1646	I agree ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY exists FOR PROFIT . 
6702	1646	means , to MAXIMIZE PROFIT ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY will drop people with conditions and try to avoid paying with exceptions in companies policies . 
6703	1646	And is why , because ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY exist to MAXIMIZE PROFIT companies will not cover you if you are old or have pre-existing condition because you are more likely to get SICK and need ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE . 
6704	1646	So unless your view is that who are young and healthy and who can afford to pay for coverage FOR PROFIT ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY provide should be able to get ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE , is exactly why system of private insurance based on FOR PROFIT ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY DOES ASPECT_NOT_WORK . 
6705	1647	There is no `` insurance without ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY . 
6706	1647	And please do not claim Medicare , which is processed through ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY for fee , and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY . 
6707	1647	Both of which you want to do cancel . 
6708	1647	And Medicaid which is welfare , not insurance profitable industries # 1 . 
6709	1647	Beverages-Brewers ------------- 25.9 profit # 10 industrial metals & minerals -- 14.8 # 20 Diversified communications -- 11.7 # 30 Home ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE -------------- 08.4 # 40 regional northeast banks ------ 07.0 # 50 ASPECT_SPORTING avtivities ----------- 06.0 # 60 aerospace products & services -- 05.2 # 70 Consumer services ------------- 04.3 # 80 Major Integrated oil gas -- 03.5 # 86 health care insurance --------- 03.3 are net profits . 
6710	1647	Besides listed above , Entertainment , Utilities , tobacco products , Auto parts , and , others are more to much more profitable businesses Your statement is inane ideological nonsense and false . 
6711	1647	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY MUST be for profit -LRB- I said in ASPECT_PREVIOU_POST that you would n't understand and obviously you do n't -RRB- and COMPANIES do exist and COMPANIES do work and COMPANIES have worked for years . 
6712	1647	problem with ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE specifically is your kind of liberal thinking has screwed KIND up . 
6713	1647	You want insurance to be payor of convenience and problem can NEVER be . 
6714	1647	PROBLEM must only cover risk , and risk we ask PROBLEM to cover , expensive problem MUST be . 
6715	1647	present problem is that everyone wants health insurance company to PAY from dollar of charges on . 
6716	1647	causes premium to be higher because WE are transferring risk to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY . 
6717	1647	When they also have to cover pre ex and no limits , premiums MUST go MUCH higher . 
6718	1647	There is NO way around . 
6719	1647	WE do NOT ask type of insurance to do , why do we ask ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE to be payor of convenience instead of covering we unacceptable risk . 
6720	1647	Would you pay 200.00 dollar collision premium on 500 car ? 
6721	1647	No , because 500 . 
6722	1647	RISK is acceptable . 
6723	1647	, even if you went to Doctor month @ 100.00 per visit and your insurer paid for visit . 
6724	1647	NO MUST charge you premium will cover NO known risk of what might happen with your health AND premium also has to be high enough to also cover your 100 per month doc charges . 
6725	1647	ie premium MUST be much higher than 1200 per year . 
6726	1647	Probably 2 to 3 times higher since 1200 is only recovering NO costs . 
6727	1648	Sure there is government insurance , like medicare and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY . 
6729	1648	So what ? 
6731	1648	So what ? 
6733	1648	So FOR PROFIT ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY to avoid RISK will cut off aged and unhealthy . 
6734	1648	is why DOES ASPECT_NOT_WORK . 
6735	1649	I 'll correct typo : `` oct 2009 10.1 aug 2010 9.6 `` Thanks ! 
6736	1650	For persons will be true . 
6737	1650	For others its higher risk . 
6738	1651	Unfortunately , ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION is not paying bills , but creating ASPECT_NEW_ONE . 
6739	1651	ONES should be cutting on unnecessary spending . 
6740	1651	ASPECT_OBAMA was against earmarks during ASPECT_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN , but has shown otherwise in ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION . 
6741	1651	ASPECT_OBAMA is of . 
6742	1651	We 'll see how pans out . 
6743	1651	WE should n't upset terrorists huh ? 
6744	1651	Improving economy ? 
6745	1651	ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_QUICK_ACTION ? 
6747	1652	I 'd love to hear your explanation of how economy going from tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 jobs month to growing ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOB being added is not improving . 
6748	1653	ASPECT_RASMUSSEN reports daily ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_TRACKING_POLL for Wednesday shows that 28 &#37; of nation voters Strongly Approve of way that ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA is performing ASPECT_OBAMA role as president . 
6749	1653	Forty-three percent -LRB- 43 -RRB- Strongly Disapprove , giving ASPECT_OBAMA presidential approval ASPECT_INDEX_RATING of -15 -LRB- see trendshttp : \ \/ \ \/ www.rasmussenreports.com \ \/ publ ... _ tracking_poll28 % love DISAPPROVE 48 have no love for man . 
6750	1653	HIM would personally tar and feather HIM well no , HIM do n't hate him that and almost feel sorry for DISAPPROVE . 
6751	1653	At and during election -LRB- more like love obama orgy 100 millionsum ' -RRB- ASPECT_OBAMA seemed like idealist kid had no experience but lots of dreams . 
6752	1653	-LRB- ASPECT_OBAMA_LACK of executive and experience along with ASPECT_OBAMA need to be liked nearly destroyed ASPECT_OBAMA and us , ie nation -rrb- . 
6753	1653	trouble is wanderlust kid is taking nation down by implementing KID socialist leaning ill thought out idealism or maybe just wishful fiat thinking that trillions here and trillions there will come from ` ' and KID seems to be trying to make ASPECT_US like KID way bad father spoils child . 
6754	1653	ASPECT_US really need tough love parent ... um ' president not perhaps well meaning but naive enabler . 
6756	1654	Specifically , what socialist leaning ill thought out idealism has ASPECT_OBAMA_IMPLEMENTED to date that you believe had been tearing nation down , and do you blame that socialist leaning ill thought out idealism for fact economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 jobs per month before ASPECT_OBAMA ever took office . 
6757	1656	health care program has n't even gotten off ground yet . 
6758	1656	Since you have identified health care program as `` socialist leaning ill thought out idealism has ASPECT_OBAMA_IMPLEMENTED to date that you believe had been tearing nation down , please explain specifically in your view how has caused ASPECT_CURRENT_ECONOMIC_SITUATION or how ASPECT_NATION contributed to fact economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 jobs month before ASPECT_OBAMA took office . 
6759	1656	Personally , SOCIALIST ca n't see how health care program had one iota to do with current state of economy , proving your assertion is nothing more than baseless , partisan political nonsense . 
6760	1658	We are talking about people buying insurance and asking to be covered for conditions pre-existed having insurance -LRB- if have in place prior insurance covered condition , is non-issue -rrb- . 
6761	1658	What I have said in I ASPECT_PREVIOU_POST is not true for , but for everyone who asks to be covered for pre-existing condition . 
6762	1658	Everyone of people is asking for beyond insurance , PEOPLE are not trying to share risk that PEOPLE might need treatment with others who also might need treatment . 
6763	1658	PEOPLE are asking others to pay , so PEOPLE can pay less , for treatment people know PEOPLE will need . 
6764	1658	If you want to institute , make argument . 
6765	1658	But do not characterize as simply insurance or characterize as risk sharing -- is neither . 
6766	1658	is charity . 
6767	1658	To be clear , I am not saying it is wrong to offer charity . 
6768	1658	But is misleading to claim would be anything other than charity . 
6769	1659	From one side of your mouth you say Medicare and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY are INSURANCE . 
6770	1659	But on threads you claim that medicare and social security beneficiaries ARE NOT entitled to beneficiaries benefits even though BENEFICIARIES paid in to program beneficiaries lives and in case of medicare beneficiaries continue to pay at 100 . 
6771	1659	per month per person . 
6772	1659	You want to take away benefits to reduce debt . 
6773	1659	YOU CAN not have debt both ways . 
6774	1659	is liberalism 101 and DEBT is wrong now , has always been wrong , and always will be wrong . 
6775	1659	in &#183; sur &#183; ance -LRB- n-shrns -RRB- a. Coverage by contract binding party to indemnify another against specified loss in return for premiums paid . 
6776	1659	You intimate in ASPECT_PREVIOU_POST ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY are making killing . 
6777	1659	Just as your lying clown in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE constantly claims COMPANIES are . 
6778	1659	When fact is that if ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY had raw material cost like manufacturers do , COMPANIES could not make FACT on 3.3 &#37; profit . 
6779	1659	When shown that ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY are not making killing you say , `` Interesting , So What ? 
6780	1659	So what is is shows your position to be pure ideological nonsense and brainwashing . 
6781	1659	Without fact to give credence to your nonsense . 
6783	1659	Please read AND comprehend definition of insurance above . 
6784	1659	It is obvious you have no idea of concept of insurance . 
6785	1659	If you did understand what insurance IS , you would understand that your arguments have no merit whatsoever . 
6786	1659	And is MERIT possible that you could actually believe that ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY have been in existence for well over 100 years and politicians have not been massively regulating politicians for decades . 
6787	1659	What 100 plus year old industry has Govt kept companies nose out of ? 
6789	1659	NONE , including insurance . 
6790	1659	Your clown-in-charge lied times about man with cancer had clown-in-charge insurance canceled to avoid expense by insurer . 
6791	1659	word of story was lie .1 . 
6792	1659	POLICY was new policy . 
6794	1659	He had pre-existing conditions HE FAILED to list on application . 
6795	1659	3 ASPECT_INSURANCE_REGULATION BY state govts allows insurers 2 years to investigate new policy for pre-existing conditions . 
6797	1659	man appealed because man pre-ex was not cancer and man had no pre-ex of cancer . 
6799	1659	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY was totally justified in canceling policy for cause , but they did relent because pre-ex was not cancer . 
6800	1659	They were NOT forced to relent , ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY choose to cover man cancer treatment and THEY did . 
6802	1659	MAN underwent full range of cancer treatment , paid for by ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY . 
6804	1659	MAN lived another 4 years after completion of treatment . 
6805	1659	But lying obummer said obummer insurance canceled man policy and OBUMMER died FOR lack OF TREATMENT . 
6806	1659	lies to con bad legislation on public Luckily but brainless sheeple know LUCKILY was lying . 
6808	1659	Once policy is in force and past 2 year look back . 
6809	1659	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY BY LAW , can not cancel health insurance policy for individual except for non-payment of premium . 
6810	1660	LAW law of land , and you seem oblivious to fact that people that control money are nervous types . 
6811	1660	Even baseless rumor can cause panic and freeze funds . 
6812	1660	Do n't beleive me try to get moderately small business loan -LRB- in hundred thousand dollar range -RRB- . 
6813	1660	ME do n't have kind of money but know do and say banks are sitting on KIND as do sources . 
6814	1660	First , with due respect and accompanying niceties , do n't attempt to box me in to your parameters . 
6815	1660	ME was making commentary not doctoral dissertation or laying out detailed abstract critiquing economic woes . 
6816	1660	And lastly request . 
6817	1660	Please use quote tags as matter of common courtesy . 
6818	1660	When interprets me bad grammar ME don know if they are being accurate , as ME said here before , ME cheated me way through k3 -rrb- through middle school english , then high school and college english grammar and sometimes math , and now , because of me ignorance are paying for IGNORANCE ! 
6819	1660	So me grammar being bad me understand if you make wrong assumptions etc. . 
6820	1660	quote tags make GRAMMAR so much easier and lessen mistaken assumptions and helps everyone . 
6821	1660	Ok me found post 1654 page 166 ; Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` trouble is wanderlust kid is taking nation down by implementing KID socialist leaning ' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- was opinion and -LRB- means ME believe ASPECT_OBAMA is socialist at heart and will attempt to mould ASPECT_USA into socialist nation . 
6822	1660	that nation will not survive as socialist country imo , and by taking REPUBLIC down ME meant REPUBLIC won t be capitalist representative democratic republic as ASPECT_IMO is today , but rather type of socialist nation , with ASPECT_OBAMA at helm of course . 
6823	1660	Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` ill thought out idealism ' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- ME was suggesting that -RRB- thought things would work by power of -RRB- personality and popularity . 
6824	1660	Rev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` or maybe just wishful fiat thinking that trillions here and trillions there will come from ` ' -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- By ME meant that fiat currency is allowing -RRB- to spend trillions , making loan officers nervous . 
6825	1660	ME believe JUST know that are printing money to pay for Obamas trillion dollar projects\/recovery etcrev said -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- ` and OBAMAS seems to be trying to make like ASPECT_OBAMAS way bad father spoils child . 
6826	1660	really need tough love parent ... um ' president not perhaps well meaning but naive enabler . ' 
6827	1660	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- Lastly means that need president will cut back where necessary and do what PRESIDENT must with taxes . 
6828	1660	ME don say that lightly me lively hood depends on how well me two non profit missions and churches perform , three which use federal grants and private donations . 
6829	1660	Now PERHAPS are performing in red and have been since crash . 
6830	1660	Well no , me reply\/rant was comment just like of your posts and others here . 
6832	1660	No again , ME vote issues not party . 
6833	1660	ME know ME may sound like me vote by party but is incorrect . 
6834	1660	said -LRB- corrected -RRB- me agree that health care atrocity had demonstrable effect on economy at moment , and did not mean to imply that . 
6835	1660	No package ASPECT_OBAMA_PACKAGE makes have money nervous . 
6836	1660	ME am speaking of corporations and lend OUR gadzillion dollar sums . 
6837	1660	Until CORPORATIONS have faith and trust in ASPECT_OBAMA recovery is going to drag along . 
6839	1664	You think ? 
6840	1664	Hey , I think we have discovered why murdoc news constantly puts out negative , misleading information about economy ! 
6841	1664	What is quote tag ? 
6842	1664	I quoted your words not because of your grammar but because folks here so often mischaracterize statements , so I try to quote verbatim relevant statement so as not to mischaracterize . 
6843	1664	WE 've been socialist for 85 years now and done OK , have n't WE ? 
6844	1664	And WE need to restore revenues by increasing taxes . 
6845	1664	Sorry to hear about your churches . 
6846	1664	Do churches really get federal ? 
6847	1664	I guess started during ASPECT_BUSH administration ? 
6848	1664	I had thought was unconstitutional . 
6849	1664	OK , so administration not ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE after is responsible for tearing nation down . 
6850	1664	We 've clarified that . 
6851	1664	Instead , it is `` ASPECT_OBAMA_PACKAGE makes have money nervous that is tearing country down . 
6852	1664	How is `` ASPECT_OBAMA_PACKAGE doing , and upon want facts or data , if , do you have to demonstrate is cause ? 
6853	1665	I do n't think Medicare is akin to Insurance . 
6854	1665	SS is . 
6855	1665	If I said Medicare was I mis-spoke and withdraw MEDICARE . 
6856	1665	Medicare is govt national health care , available only to over 65 . 
6857	1665	MEDICARE 's not wrong at . 
6858	1665	There is no contract that guarantees you SS or medicare benefits . 
6859	1665	fact you paid taxes in life does give you entitlements . 
6860	1665	I 've never claimed SS is insurance policy . 
6861	1665	I 've said POLICY is social insurance , like insurance pool resources and provide benefits if and only if certain conditions occur . 
6862	1665	I 've intimated of sort . 
6863	1665	Quit wasting I time with strawmen . 
6864	1665	I siad that ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY are for profit and therefore will endeavor to avoid paying benefits by excluding coverage on likely to meet condition for benefits . 
6865	1665	Because COVERAGE is irrelevant . 
6866	1665	How do you figure ? 
6867	1665	I position is logical and factually supported . 
6868	1666	You do have sense of humor ! 
6869	1667	If you worked your life , you paid mega money into ASPECT_MEDICARE , they just borrowed LIFE and spent life wrong ! 
6870	1667	-LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- heathens ! 
6871	1667	MONEY 's your money being paid back to you ... Unfortunately , HEATHENS manage MONEY incorrectly , MONEY should not be touched , ever ! 
6873	1670	women represents ASPECT_WAY_AMERICAN are feeling , unfortunately ! 
6876	1671	You have sense of dodging and dancing when you have no argument . 
6877	1672	ha ha ha , so funny and maybe true ... maybe not ... . 
6878	1673	I 've lumped of above in one quote , since of it shows you to have no knowledge of country you live in . 
6879	1673	above programs , ASPECT_MEDICARE , and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY are INSURANCE . 
6880	1673	Both are coverage in exchange for premiums . 
6881	1673	One is medical coverage , one is social coverage . 
6882	1673	And BOTH are 2 `` entitlement programs . 
6883	1673	Entitlements are bad mouthed on both sides of aisle , but what both are lumping in with & ss are give away programs , which are not entitlements , BOTH are welfare , like subsidized housing , ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP , Medicaid . 
6884	1673	2 entitlement programs have PAID BOTH premiums . 
6885	1673	It is politicians , both parties , have blown Med . 
6886	1673	& ss money on things including welfare programs listed above , do not pay in penny but take out Billions per year . 
6887	1673	But I digress , ASPECT_MEDICARE and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY are insurance programs MANDATED by Govt . 
6888	1673	We do not have choice of paying for BILLIONS or not . 
6889	1673	premiums are taken in form of ASPECT_FICA_TAX . 
6890	1673	Are you in way aware of what ASPECT_F.I.C.A. means ? 
6891	1673	federal insurance contributions act . 
6892	1673	And is separate from ASPECT_INCOME_TAX . 
6893	1673	6.2 &#37; and 1.45 of income is taken FOR social security and medicare respectively . 
6894	1673	And both are means tested . 
6895	1673	Medicare you 've made in your working life , you 've paid in , but you receive only benefit of made ASPECT_MINIMUM_WAGE for 40 quarters of BOTH working life . 
6896	1673	Plus if you make over 100,000 and you 're on Medicare , you monthly premium is higher than people making less . 
6897	1673	Plus in lower income ranges can have premiums lower or waived altogether and co-pays reduced or zeroed . 
6898	1673	ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , you made , you paid in , benefit you receive . 
6899	1673	is means testing . 
6900	1673	And if one is making over 108,000 . 
6901	1673	ss tax stops , as does accrual of benefit . 
6902	1673	Yes , people will get max ss payout , but PEOPLE also paid highest premiums . 
6903	1673	And if PEOPLE are still making high incomes people pay income tax on people ss benefits at regular income tax rates on 50 of benefit , or 85 of benefit depending on people income . 
6904	1673	People living on SS alone , do not pay ASPECT_INCOME_TAX on people ss benefits . 
6905	1673	Your post makes TAX obvious to readers that you either do hate rich or you have been ideologically brainwashed into reciting present day liberal line . 
6906	1673	In years past liberal line was tax big business . 
6907	1673	But when PEOPLE realized that public knew that just meant higher prices , liberals changed to `` hate rich nonsense . 
6908	1673	And you have quite obviously bought into stupidity , wholeheartedly . 
6909	1673	Again your basic misconceptions about insurance show through . 
6910	1673	Excluding coverage for WITH pre-existing conditions is done , with 100 approval of insurance regulators -LRB- elected or appointed politicians -RRB- , solely to keep premiums lower for who are transferring risk to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY in exchange for premium . 
6911	1673	Covering already needing treatment is transferring cost , not risk . 
6912	1673	RISK is necessary factor in insurance equation . 
6913	1673	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY can not be in business of taking on costs , COMPANIES have to take on risk . 
6914	1673	Do n't know why you are UNABLE to grasp simple concept . 
6915	1673	Your position is one of misconception , and ideological nonsense , and distortions . 
6916	1673	And I was being kind to say you have sense of humor . 
6917	1673	Your fuzzy glimpse of reality is sad , not funny . 
6918	1673	If I was predisposed to feel sorry for people , I 'm not , I 'd feel sorry for you 
6919	1674	I can see your point . 
6920	1674	I 'll agree medicare is like insurance to , in way . 
6921	1674	You seem to have mistaken impression that political view that wealthy ought to pay taxes equates to hate . 
6922	1674	Of course impression does n't . 
6923	1674	Cost is function of risk . 
6924	1674	I completely understand that person who is aged or has pre-existing condition carries greater risk of higher cost . 
6925	1674	is why for profit ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSURER will seek to cut out persons . 
6926	1674	And why system of private insurance does not work for national heath care . 
6927	1674	I disagree with your opinions . 
6928	1674	Others can decide for OTHERS . 
6929	1674	I can tell you are not kind who would feel sorry for people . 
6930	1675	And I am very comfortable with . 
6931	1675	Feeling sorry for people instead of demanding PEOPLE get off people ass and haul people load is about 70 of problems in country . 
6932	1675	I did `` red because pleases you so . 
6933	1675	See I have sense of macabre , err , humor too 
6934	1677	There 's no legal contract with SS , and ASPECT_LIBERAL 'm pretty sure medicare as well . 
6935	1677	Again , LIBERAL have no surprise you are not kind would not feel sorry for people and are comfortable with CONTRACT . 
6936	1677	SURPRISE why you are conservative and liberal 'm liberal .

6958	1680	I pay I way . 
6960	1681	No you do not . 
6961	1681	You demand that people above 200,000 pay taxes so liberals can waste money on useless ASPECT_SOCIAL_PROGRAM . 
6962	1681	You want ASPECT_SOCIAL_PROGRAM , you pay for PEOPLE . 
6963	1681	YOU 'll gladly sign opt out form so that YOU can not participate in your liberal utopian dreamworld . 
6964	1681	But YOU refuse to pay for stupidity does not work . 
6965	1682	is not true . 
6966	1682	demand that people pay taxes to reduce huge debt you conservatives love to run up . 
6967	1683	We love to run up ? 
6968	1683	wow , do WE need to show you statistics about ASPECT_OBAMA compared to ASPECT_BUSH ? 
6969	1683	You really seem to be mis-informed . 
6970	1684	Check statistics of reagan , ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_BUSH compared to ASPECT_CLINTON or president between wwii and ASPECT_REAGAN and find out I 'm not . 
6971	1685	Pardon shoey but `` We People bailed out banks , ASPECT_WALL_STREET and general motors . 
6972	1685	shoey demand retribution and propose legislation for 1 &#37; tax on stock market exchanges , 1 tax on bank transactions and 1 tax on gm automobile sold , new or used . 
6973	1685	90 of revenue generated from taxes will be used as down payment on ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT -LRB- public debt -RRB- and remaining 10 will be dispersed in checks back to ASPECT_U.S. citizens who pay taxes . 
6974	1685	SHOEY am ASPECT_SHOEY and message is surely not ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE approved . 
6975	1686	GIVEN , past was bad . 
6976	1686	How does make BHO , spending at faster rate than of past pres ' good ? 
6977	1686	PRES were bad , GIVEN is equally guilty and then . 
6978	1686	Before HIM make LAME azz excuse for him -LRB- hallmark of given presidency -RRB- bad past people had `` good reasons for pres spending too . 
6979	1686	Out of control spending IS out of control spending , no matter WHAT supposed reason . 
6980	1686	Then and NOW !! 
6981	1687	i will not vote FOR him again , him does not have CLUE ! 
6982	1688	What was good reason for ASPECT_BUSH squandering surplus and running up 5 trillion in debt ? 
6983	1688	What was good reason for ASPECT_REAGAN taking small deficit and quadrupling DEFICIT and tripling debt ? 
6984	1688	ASPECT_OBAMA inherited worst ASPECT_ECONOMIC_SITUATION since great depression mandated fiscal stimulus . 
6985	1688	I agree ASPECT_OBAMA needs to reduce deficits and should raise taxes and trim spending . 
6986	1688	I 've said situation times . 
6987	1689	What you can not comprehend is that they always have `` good reason . 
6988	1689	Same as obummer has `` good reason . 
6989	1689	But THEY good reason AND obummer good reasons are simply excuses put out by spenders . 
6990	1689	THERE is no good reasons for spending Trillions we do not have . 
6991	1689	There was no good reason then , there is no good reason now . 
6992	1689	And you need to study history with your eyes and ears and mind open . 
6993	1689	What obummer faced and faces is about 1\/2 as bad as what ASPECT_REAGAN faced . 
6994	1689	Less than half actually . 
6995	1689	bad economy , bad unemployment PLUS massive double digit inflation . 
6996	1689	I lived and worked in days . 
6997	1689	If person made 2000 ira contribution to bank for 22 years , at interest rate banks were paying for ordinary cd , they would become millionaire . 
6998	1689	You could go to grocery store week later and buy grocery list and pay 20 , 25.00 for goods . 
6999	1689	Did reagan believe believe had good reason for spending like BELIEVE did ? 
7000	1689	Sure believe did . 
7001	1689	But we are paying today for precedent believe set then . 
7002	1689	as WE will pay for obummer idiocy . 
7003	1689	WE will suffer in future for obummer policies today , PLUS inflation WILL run wild again . 
7004	1689	chemo treatment is 100 effective against cancer is useless if PLAN also kills patient . 
7005	1689	was oBum treatment plan except PLAN is killing patient AND PLAN is not effective . 
7006	1689	But PLAN IS more expensive than anything else ever tried in history . 
7007	1690	During sever recession there are very good reasons to increase spending . 
7008	1690	creates demand and picks up slack caused by overreaction of markets and economy to lessen full effect of recession or recessionary spiral into depression . 
7009	1690	Interest rates were high because of ASPECT_FED actions to kill inflation , but ASPECT_REAGAN inhereted economy where relative size of debt was lowest in 45 years and economy was growing at 7 + &#37; real . 
7010	1690	ASPECT_OBAMA inherited record deficits , highest relative debt in 60 years , and economy tanking at -7 . 
7011	1690	Easy choice which one I 'd rather walk into . 
7012	1690	Depends on what you mean . 
7013	1690	Relatively Govt spent far on WWII and probably close to for Reagans military buildup . 
7014	1690	And in perspective , spending on stimulus is no more than cost of mistaken ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR , and really only ASPECT_COUPLE_YEAR extra annual ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING compared to 2000 . 
7015	1692	Not true . 
7016	1692	ASPECT_OBAMA has spent like mad man . 
7017	1692	Keep drinking kool-aid . 
7019	1692	You mean accept . 
7020	1692	Not going to matter in November once republicans control everything , have fun ... you only have months left . 
7021	1692	Please elaborate on good choices . 
7022	1692	I ca n't seem to think of , oh 's because there are none . 
7023	1692	everything commander does is to redistribute wealth . 
7024	1692	unemployment rate has gone way up . 
7025	1692	COMMANDER lied times about ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE . 
7026	1692	problem is COMMANDER does everything is unpopular . 
7027	1692	COMMANDER is supposed to follow what people want . 
7028	1692	everything commander does is opposite of ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPINION . 
7029	1692	In words there are people upset than happy . 
7030	1692	Yeah since COMMANDER had choice ASPECT_OBAMA has only continued war , drones left and right . 
7031	1692	Well COMMANDER is commander in chief , is COMMANDER job . 
7032	1692	As for criticism ... People are finally catching on to COMMANDER non-sense , even people who fell for CRITICISM in place . 
7033	1692	Hell yes we are going to criticize NON-SENSE when NON-SENSE is spending ASPECT_WE_MONEY like MONEY grows on trees to give to people who do . 
7034	1692	No , NO does n't . 
7035	1692	WE are n't moving to socialist\/communist nation . 
7036	1692	Why give second chance ? 
7037	1692	NO 's not going to change NO ideas . 
7038	1692	NO is set on running ASPECT_AMERICA straight into ground . 
7039	1694	You 're right . 
7040	1694	They have to run on . 
7041	1694	Only bash side . 
7042	1695	DEMOCRAT campaign topics , Its bush fault . 
7043	1695	Tax rich . 
7044	1695	FAULT FOX fault . 
7045	1695	Spend , but do n't call FAULT stimulus . 
7046	1695	FAULT ASPECT_BECK fault . 
7047	1695	Tax rich . 
7048	1695	FAULT was worse then we `` thought . 
7049	1695	`` Spend more . 
7050	1695	ASPECT_BARAK who ? 
7051	1695	Tax rich . 
7052	1695	people are dumb ! 
7053	1695	Spend . 
7054	1695	FAULT ASPECT_TEA_PARTY fault . 
7055	1695	Tax rich . 
7056	1695	Conservative are racist . 
7057	1695	Spend . 
7058	1695	Give us time , ASPECT_US 've only had control since 1\/2007 ! 
7059	1695	Tax rich . 
7060	1695	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is dangerous . 
7061	1695	Spend . 
7062	1695	FAULT fault . 
7063	1695	Tax rich . 
7064	1695	Republican just say no , FAULT not fault . 
7065	1695	Spend . 
7066	1695	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is racist . 
7067	1695	xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xno platform , NO programs other than spend wildly . 
7068	1695	Just whine and blame everybody but themselves . 
7069	1696	Foregoing obvious quip about certain recent president , ASPECT_US 'd have to nominate james k polk as worst president in us history , considering fact that PRESIDENT started blatant war of aggression and territorial expansion on flimsiest of pretexts , and nearly started another war with ASPECT_BRITAIN for similar reasons . 
7070	1696	As for ASPECT_OBAMA , ASPECT_US would say that ASPECT_OBAMA done remarkable job under very adverse circumstances , and even if ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY ended today , ASPECT_OBAMA 'd be remembered as notable president with accomplishments . 
7071	1696	Let examine point by point : - `` ASPECT_OBAMA has not kept of ASPECT_OBAMA_CAMPAIGN promises . 
7073	1696	Let check . 
7074	1696	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM ? 
7076	1696	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_STIMULUS ? 
7078	1696	Financial reform ? 
7080	1696	Winding down war in ASPECT_IRAQ ? 
7082	1696	Sending forces to ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN ? 
7084	1696	Improving nation infrastructure ? 
7086	1696	Building green economy ? 
7088	1696	Err , which promises did you have in mind , exactly ? 
7089	1696	For complete rundown on promises kept or broken , look here : http : \ \/ \ \/ politifact.com \ \/ truth-o-meter\/promises \ \/ - `` ERR has not been transparent . 
7090	1696	`` Compared to what ? 
7091	1696	luminiferous aether ? 
7092	1696	While ASPECT_OBAMA certainly could have done better in regard , COMPARED certainly made improvements compared to COMPARED predecessors . 
7093	1696	For example , you can track exactly where ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY is going at http : \ \/ \ \/ www.recovery.gov\/Pages\/home.aspx - `` YOU has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no ASPECT_TAX_CUT for 95 of ASPECT_AMERICANS -RRB- . 
7094	1696	`` Well duh . 
7095	1696	who was elected President in 2008 would have had to raise taxes at point . 
7096	1696	ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT were simply irresponsible and unsustainable . 
7097	1696	- `` ASPECT_BUSH has increased spending\/size of government to record levels . 
7098	1696	`` You 're talking about ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL ? 
7099	1696	ASPECT_BUSH will remind YOU that two years ago economists from over political spectrum were warning of very danger of second Great depression . 
7100	1696	In case YOU 've forgotten YOU high school history , Great Depression involved unemployment rates in neighborhood of 25 , thousands of ASPECT_BANK_FAILURE , huge numbers of ASPECT_AMERICAN forced to lived in ASPECT_HOOVERVILLES - makeshift camps for homeless . 
7101	1696	YOU really think averting ASPECT_ECONOMIC_COLLAPSE is n't worth spending money on ? 
7102	1696	- `` YOU has \ \/ will increase THOUSANDS deficit to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL . 
7103	1696	`` So huge recurring , structural deficit to fund ASPECT_TAX_CUT for rich is okie-dokie , but one time emergency expenditure is end of world ? 
7104	1696	And were n't you just complaining about taxes being raised ? 
7105	1696	Make up YOU mind - YOU ca n't have YOU cake and eat CAKE too . 
7106	1696	- `` YOU ignores people and pushes through legislation way YOU can . 
7107	1696	`` Errr , were n't errr criticizing ASPECT_CLINTON just years ago for making policy decisions based on polling ? 
7108	1696	And YOU seem to recall pretty constant complaints about `` Do congress . 
7109	1696	You should really make up your mind which you want . 
7110	1696	- `` YOU has weakened national security\/border security . 
7111	1696	`` How exactly ? 
7112	1696	ASPECT_OBAMA has reduced stress on severely overextended ASPECT_US military . 
7113	1696	world standing has greatly improved and 're seeing cooperation both from traditional allies and from world powers such as ASPECT_RUSSIA and ASPECT_CHINA . 
7114	1696	Honestly , just running around world threatening to bomb do n't like does not make ASPECT_US secure . 
7115	1696	Considering that JUST greatly reduces credibility of threats of military force , YOU 'd say JUST does opposite . 
7116	1696	As for border , if anything , ASPECT_OBAMA has increased border enforcement compared to ASPECT_BUSH . 
7117	1696	- `` ASPECT_OBAMA has several proposed policies will hurt Americans and economy . 
7118	1696	`` as what ? 
7119	1696	OBAMA really have no idea what you 're on about with one . 
7120	1696	YOU consider ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY leads to 9 unemployment rather then 25 to have hurt economy ? 
7121	1696	How exactly do YOU figure ? 
7122	1696	- `` YOU is shunning allies and kissing asses of enemies . 
7123	1696	`` who ever uttered words `` freedom fries has absolutely no room to speak on subject . 
7124	1696	friends tell you when you 're making mistake . 
7125	1696	People who simply go along with anything and everything you want are n't friends , PEOPLE 're sycophants . 
7126	1696	And have you ever considered actually asking allies what ALLIES think of matter ? 
7127	1696	ASPECT_OBAMA is very popular in ASPECT_EUROPE and rest of world . 
7128	1696	ASPECT_US happened to be on trip to ASPECT_ENGLAND on election day 2008 -LRB- ASPECT_US voted by absentee ballot -RRB- and when ASPECT_US went to airport to come back , guy at customs desk gave ASPECT_US hearty congratulations on ASPECT_OBAMA election when GUY saw ASPECT_US ASPECT_US passport . 
7129	1696	As for enemies , ASPECT_IRAN , at least , is in , weaker position now then ASPECT_IRAN was two years ago . 
7130	1696	Between internal dissension -LRB- Which ASPECT_OBAMA encouraged by holding out hand in ASPECT_OBAMA_INAUGURAL -RRB- and growing international opposition -LRB- Thanks to ASPECT_OBAMA_ENGAGING in diplomacy -RRB- ASPECT_AHMADINEJAD regime has gone from being on verge of regional domination to severely hemmed in and with options . 
7131	1696	- `` ASPECT_OBAMA continues to spew lies and BS to ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE . 
7132	1696	`` Unless you 'd care to provide examples , is meaningless insult on about level of accusing ASPECT_OBAMA of having cooties . 
7133	1696	To sum up , although ASPECT_OBAMA has been far from perfect and can certainly be criticized on points , over ASPECT_OBAMA done quite good job under very adverse circumstances . 
7134	1696	Yes , economy still sucks , but YOU know what ? 
7135	1696	President ca n't simply order prosperity to return . 
7136	1696	us economy is massive with mind of THING own that government has limited means to influence . 
7137	1696	There really is n't magic wand in safe in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE somewhere . 
7138	1696	Well , unless YOU 're advocating change to command economy ... Things are much better then they would have been otherwise . 
7139	1696	Why Democrats are n't running on is puzzle to ASPECT_US . 
7140	1696	commentators seem to think is too complex argument for ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTER to grasp . 
7141	1696	ASPECT_US sincerely hope COMMENTATORS 're wrong . 
7142	1696	So yes , ASPECT_US will very likely vote to re-elect ASPECT_OBAMA . 
7143	1696	And no , ASPECT_US almost certainly would n't vote for ASPECT_PALIN . 
7144	1696	Regardless of what YOU think of ASPECT_NO politics , ASPECT_PALIN has demonstrated disturbingly weak grasp of issues and NO competence to perform duties of office are questionable at best . 
7145	1697	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CAMPAIGN_TOPICSIT_OBAMA fault . 
7146	1697	Cut taxes for rich . 
7147	1697	FAULT ASPECT_MSM fault . 
7148	1697	Spend , but do n't call FAULT stimulus . 
7149	1697	FAULT ASPECT_BIDEN fault . 
7150	1697	Cut taxes for rich . 
7151	1697	It is worse that FAULT is . 
7152	1697	Borrow . 
7153	1697	ASPECT_SARAH who ? 
7154	1697	Cut taxes for rich . 
7155	1697	people are dumb ! 
7156	1697	Borrow . 
7157	1697	Its ASPECT_TEA_PARTY fault . 
7158	1697	Cut taxes for rich . 
7159	1697	ASPECT_OBAMA is racist . 
7160	1697	Spend . 
7161	1697	Kick them out , THEM 've had control since jan 2009 ! 
7162	1697	Cut taxes for rich . 
7163	1697	liberals are dangerous . 
7164	1697	Borrow . 
7165	1697	Its fault . 
7166	1697	Cut taxes for rich . 
7167	1697	Everything is ASPECT_OBAMA fault . 
7168	1697	Spend . 
7169	1697	Blacks are racists . 
7170	1697	Cut taxes for rich . 
7171	1698	He certainly was not one of best . 
7172	1698	I almost fell off I chair laughing at one . 
7173	1698	of promises kept will be detrimental to economy . 
7174	1698	HE stimulus certainly has not panned out . 
7175	1698	Obamacare will most certainly be disastrous , and Americans favor repeal . 
7176	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA is doing somewhat better , I believe , but not to ASPECT_DEGREE_OBAMA said ASPECT_OBAMA would , and certainly only after pressure to do so . 
7177	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA_STIMULUS is very questionable at to whether STIMULUS had any affect on economy other than increasing deficit . 
7178	1698	One-time emergency expenditure ? 
7179	1698	You have n't been paying attention to ASPECT_OBAMA_SPENDING and projected deficits ASPECT_OBAMA will incur . 
7180	1698	They are history-making and record-breaking . 
7181	1698	I was not complaining about ASPECT_CLINTON , personally . 
7182	1698	Americans were against ASPECT_OBAMACARE because Americans know SPENDING will not do what obama thinks SPENDING will . 
7183	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA is viewed as weak by countries . 
7184	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA apology tour certainly has not helped . 
7185	1698	of ASPECT_OBAMA actions on border were ASPECT_LIP_SERVICE . 
7186	1698	National guards troops without enforcement authority or loaded weapons . 
7187	1698	OBAMA 600 million increase in border funding is drop in bucket of what ASPECT_OBAMA should be doing . 
7188	1698	hid dohs has suspended several administrative checks regarding status of folks in ASPECT_U.S. allows for illegal activity . 
7189	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA said STATUS would stay under 8 , yet has gone to 10 . 
7190	1698	What makes you think ASPECT_OBAMA had anything to do with numbers not getting worse ? 
7191	1698	Maybe folks would not have reached 10 if ASPECT_OBAMA left ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR alone and did n't spend like ASPECT_PARIS hilton on Rodeo drive . 
7192	1698	OBAMA may have been popular before election , and shortly thereafter , but now ASPECT_OBAMA is not . 
7193	1698	I am in ASPECT_EUROPE at least once month on business , and ASPECT_OBAMA is not that popular anymore . 
7194	1698	folks view ASPECT_OBAMA as just typical politician and of . 
7195	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA continues to live in pipe dream believing OBAMA policies are helping economy . 
7196	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA pushes Obamacare even though fear dream , and Americans want DREAM repealed . 
7197	1698	scary is that I really think ASPECT_OBAMA thinks ASPECT_OBAMA is right with ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICY , even though are against ASPECT_OBAMA . 
7198	1698	Just speculation . 
7199	1698	I am not sure ASPECT_PALIN is right person for job . 
7200	1698	I certainly think PERSON is smart lady , and just does n't act like typical politician . 
7201	1698	PERSON could certainly do no worse that ASPECT_OBAMA , ASPECT_IMO . 
7202	1698	ASPECT_OBAMA is good bs-er . 
7203	1698	OBAMA actually had no experience or credentials to be POTUS . 
7204	1698	EXPERIENCE is also very clear , according to poll , that ASPECT_OBAMA is not very popular anymore . 
7206	1699	- You must be filthy rich or just committed tea party enthusiast . 
7207	1699	YOU travel only to thread , and time , YOU see multiple posts by you are nothing more than opinionated nonsense , full of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_RHETORIC knowledgable , in touch person can refute . 
7208	1699	And , when they do -- as YOU have on occasion -- dan-no rebuttal is more of opinionated nonsense . 
7209	1699	Like conservatives , your posts reveal that you `` think ? 
7210	1699	posting stuff over and over will convince others you have argument . 
7211	1699	-- -- -- YOU -- -- !!!!!! 
7212	1699	You are like biting fly that pesters person until solution is `` swat , so , here 's mine -- 
7213	1700	Please tell me one 's incorrect on his list ... ONE 
7214	1701	First , you do n't know what ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is . 
7215	1701	You only know what your brainwashing elitists tell you to think . 
7216	1701	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , simply put , is overwhelming majority of ASPECT_AMERICAN_CITIZEN . 
7217	1701	mainstream ASPECT_AMERICA IS ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , actually join , others are just sympathetic to tea party ideas . 
7218	1701	And everything I posted that elicited your derogatory quote is accurate depiction of liberal statements . 
7219	1701	Made over and over and over . 
7220	1701	-- -- -- I -- -- !!!!!! 
7221	1701	Yes conservatives DO have opinions , based in reality and truth . 
7222	1701	Your quote proves that liberals have opinions too . 
7223	1701	Based in beautiful theories can not continue . 
7224	1701	You liberals want things for persons , beautiful , wonderful goal . 
7225	1701	Talk to CHARITIES , not governments . 
7226	1702	READERS Please Note !!! 
7227	1702	Conservatives like to hawk readers `` views but seldom supply `` unbiased sources for conservatives `` facts . 
7228	1702	Research of conservatives `` facts shows heavy , fundamental reliance on republican\/tea party propaganda . 
7229	1702	When challenged for conservatives propaganda , CONSERVATIVES change subject or ignore challenge completely . 
7230	1702	Thus , is not debate , but biased , single minded rehearsed tirade of unfounded , opinionated rhetoric . 
7231	1702	Now , I am quick to remind that NOW perfectly OK to have opinion and to post OPINION no matter how perverse or ill-advised , BUT , in ASPECT_AMERICAN democracy , we people , have means to research material and when one does , one is not surprised to discover just how slanted and unfounded conservative propaganda is . 
7232	1702	Here 's example : Both dan-no40 and onalandline deride `` stimulus . 
7233	1702	How about report just released today by ASPECT_WH and confirmed in article in ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST : Report gives stimulus high marks by ASPECT_LORI ASPECT_MONTGOMERY . 
7234	1702	read report and judge for yourself . 
7235	1702	Facts are facts and opinion is just -- opinion ! 
7236	1704	TRIFLE may be that 20 years is your `` right time to evaluate current president , but TRIFLE trifle `` long term for me -- and perhaps for you depending upon your age . 
7237	1704	ME was around when ASPECT_REAGAN was president and even tho ' me voted for ASPECT_NIXON , ME found ASPECT_REAGAN to be b-picture actor `` acting like president . 
7238	1704	ASPECT_REAGAN best performance was convincing everyone reagan was `` good president . 
7239	1704	Further , ASPECT_REAGAN likely had Alzheimer when reagan was in ASPECT_WH , and it was reported that ASPECT_REAGAN was often caught ` nodding ' off during meetings . 
7240	1704	Personally , ME prefer to depend on who can be aroused at 2 AM with emergency . 
7241	1704	ME am Independent , and ME agree that bratboy ASPECT_BUSH was worst president during me lifetime . 
7242	1704	ME did not support ASPECT_OBAMA during 2008 campaign -LRB- ME supported ASPECT_HILLARY and was very angry with ASPECT_DNC for taking ASPECT_TEXAS away from HILLARY and ` giving ' texas to ASPECT_OBAMA and for ignoring 18 million votes HILLARY got nationally . 
7243	1704	me blame ASPECT_TED ASPECT_KENNEDY for bit of ` political slight of hand . ' 
7244	1704	ME never supported ASPECT_KENNEDY , either -RRB- . 
7245	1704	But , there is NO way me can support political perfidy permeates ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY since ASPECT_REAGAN . 
7246	1704	people are ` off charts ' when comes to reason and proffering people ` facts ' as truth . 
7247	1704	PEOPLE are pro-wealth and corporate personhood -LRB- Corporations are not human and have one purpose : to make profit . 
7248	1704	Constitution was written FOR preservation of ` human ' life , liberty and pursuit of happiness , not profit -rrb- . 
7249	1704	CONSTITUTION is ASPECT_ME_OPINION that conservatives on SCOTUS are group of anti-constitutional nincompoops ! 
7250	1704	best ASPECT_OBAMA has done so far , in me view , is to nominate 2 women to ASPECT_COURT . 
7251	1704	brilliant women have faced slings and arrows of sex discrimination by `` good ole boys ' club and likely will write opinions based on humanitarian rather than corporate needs when WOMEN must judge of crackpot laws ASPECT_REPUBLICAN dominated ASPECT_CONGRESS passed and both gwb and wjc signed into law . 
7252	1704	As for so called ` blue dog ' democrats , DEMOCRATS 're now simply out of closet homogametic republicans . 
7253	1704	May democrats rue democrats votes to DEMOCRATS political deathbed . 
7254	1706	You have serious issues and should seek counseling ! 
7255	1706	And `` politicians lie is not newsflash . 
7256	1706	Both parties are and have been guilty of taking anything out of context and using NEWSFLASH to parties best advantage . 
7257	1706	For instance , ASPECT_REID did say what ASPECT_REID is claimed to have said , IS FACT . 
7258	1706	Using FACT in manner other than how ASPECT_REID meant FACT IS politics . 
7259	1706	simple fact , obummer came in with 69 approval . 
7260	1706	Today 30 of public says PUBLIC would vote to re-elect ASPECT_REID . 
7261	1706	's public saying that , not politicians . 
7262	1707	Go to log cabin republicans.com and see gay people who are normal , media reports them undignified on purpose ... Democrats exploit THEM and give THEM hope in election , but never deliver ... ASPECT_JOLLEE 
7263	1709	hELL NO ! 
7264	1709	LIKE asking me IF i want economy too fail forever ! 
7266	1710	I think failure of economy would do us good . 
7267	1710	FAILURE would highlight inherent failings of Capitalism . 
7268	1710	Capitalism is UNSUSTAINABLE . 
7269	1710	Capitalism is defined by competition . 
7270	1710	question generation -LRB- breathing -rrb- faces , is : what happens when wins ? 
7271	1710	power wielded by winners - is I want folks to contemplate . 
7273	1713	Readers , please note : ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE ? 
7274	1713	ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST ? 
7275	1713	Certainly unbiased sources . 
7278	1714	Are you serious ? 
7279	1714	One of biased websites owned by ASPECT_OBAMA_CRONY . 
7280	1715	Power wielded by winners is clearly thousands of ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_POINT better than power wielded by LOSERS . 
7281	1715	Humans have brains allow us to out think animals . 
7282	1715	And ASPECT_US make better use of tools than animals . 
7283	1715	But make no mistake , ASPECT_US live in jungle as animals do . 
7284	1715	Ours is often made of concrete and steel now , instead of trees . 
7285	1715	But ASPECT_US only changed CONCRETE appearance , jungle still jungle and always will be . 
7286	1715	And losers do not rule jungle anywhere . 
7287	1715	And never will . 
7288	1715	Capitalism IS unbreakable law of jungle . 
7289	1715	Liberalism can temporarily prostitute that law , but LAW can not even begin to fundamentally change LAW . 
7290	1715	want to live productive lives and prosper , will ! 
7291	1715	others will get what others have earned . 
7292	1715	To say , `` Capitalism is UNSUSTAINABLE , is to be completely out of touch with reality . 
7293	1716	we would have needed it 3 republicans to believe in gay rights and WE would have had open gays in military . 
7294	1716	3 ASPECT_REPUBLICANS . 
7295	1716	Do n't give me that democrats do n't deliver -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- . 
7296	1716	DEMOCRATS worked democrats ass off for gay rights and republicans said no to yet another civil rights issue . 
7297	1717	Now , for another lesson in ` truthiness : `` Therefore , if you KNOW what politician or pundit says is lie , then NOW ` freedom of speech ' for YOU to continue to spread lie ? 
7298	1717	On what moral compass do YOU set philosophy ? 
7299	1717	On what serpent in ASPECT_GARDEN ASPECT_OF ASPECT_EDEN had to say , perhaps ? 
7300	1717	's kind of collective dishonesty that ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and THEREFORE conservative fellow travelers use to spread TRAVELERS unamerican philosophy of ' political hatred , ' and TRAVELERS unreasonable goal to foster governmental turmoil and eventual destruction in stable democracy . 
7301	1717	How can tea party\/conservative ASPECT_REPUBLICAN party justify philosophy without undermining Constitutional ideals of ` human ' life , liberty and pursuit of happiness and that ` men -LRB- mankind -RRB- are created equal ? ' 
7302	1717	Again , ASPECT_OBAMA popularity is NOT question supporting thread . 
7303	1717	YEARS , `` Would you vote for ASPECT_OBAMA in 2010 ? 
7304	1717	's 2 years from now . 
7305	1717	In politics , 's eternity . 
7306	1717	IOW , just another example of conservative distraction and manipulation to distort facts to suit YOU ASPECT_POLITICAL_PURPOSE . 
7307	1717	of us are not so intellectually ignorant or ` needy ' for political ` purification . ' 
7308	1718	Since you have hooked up ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and conservatives republicans , it is obvious that you have not looked into it for yourself . 
7309	1718	YOU are simply repeating and spreading liberal lies . 
7310	1718	What conservative republicans , or moderate republicans , or radical republicans , have to say does not matter to me than what Democrats of ilk have to say . 
7311	1718	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY does not speak for ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and ASPECT_TEA_PARTY does not speak for ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY . 
7312	1718	Democrats and republicans ARE ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY . 
7313	1718	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is not ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY , PARTY is grass roots movement of MAJORITY of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC . 
7314	1718	PARTY does not speak with one voice , nor is PARTY coordinated . 
7315	1718	liberal media demonizes ASPECT_TEA_PARTY because PARTIES fear PARTY . 
7316	1718	Not for violence , but that liberal media is afraid of losing party power . 
7317	1718	And POWER will , precisely because media SHOULD be reporting facts and events as PARTIES ARE , NOT as PARTIES 'd like PARTIES to be . 
7318	1718	Rather than vomiting out pablum your liberal loonies have taught you , you should go and see ASPECT_TEA_PARTY for yourself and with open mind . 
7319	1718	What you will see is AMERICA working way it is supposed to work . 
7320	1718	For people , by people . 
7321	1718	You should be embracing ASPECT_AMERICA rather than helping spread lies by elitists afraid of losing people powers . 
7322	1718	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is not ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY , but ASPECT_AMERICA is already larger than either ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY or ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY . 
7323	1719	Are you claiming that ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST has liberal bias ??? 
7324	1719	: laughing : Maybe was case in 1970 , but is certainly not case in 2010 . 
7325	1719	If anything , ASPECT_POST has right wing bias , not way around . 
7326	1720	vote was 56 to 43 . 
7327	1720	Yet there are 41 republicans . 
7328	1720	You did not get democratic\/independent vote either . 
7329	1720	So HOW is HOW Republicans fault ? 
7330	1720	Why are you not pointing finger at your dissenting democrats ????? 
7331	1720	For well over year democrats had held 60 to 40 super majority . 
7332	1720	Yet they constantly claimed Republicans were blocking everything , mathematical impossibility . 
7333	1720	Now Dems hold 59 to 41 advantage . 
7334	1720	When vote is 59 to 41 , THEN you can gripe about Republicans , but 43 never is 59-41 . 
7335	1720	Get your group in order , then complain . 
7336	1720	Until then blaming Republicans is just another in , , line of liberal excuses and avoiding blame for then shortcomings . 
7337	1721	LIBERAL could n't possibly agree with you , and LIBERAL am liberal . 
7338	1721	It is lie to convince people who are left wing to continue to support corporatist , decidedly not left wing ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC ASPECT_PARTY . 
7339	1721	So people lie and blame republicans . 
7340	1721	Well Democrats are not that stupid . 
7341	1721	Democrats understand math , and know that for about year , Democrats could have done whatever people felt like . 
7342	1721	PEOPLE could have passed progressive ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM , included ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION . 
7343	1721	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM benefited ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE , by insuring uninsured and lowering premiums for rest of us . 
7344	1721	Instead what ASPECT_US got was handout to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY . 
7345	1721	COMPANIES continue to try to blame Republicans for companies lack of progress , but reality is COMPANIES are owned by corporate and special interests Republicans are . 
7346	1721	COMPANIES have simply convinced people companies are party of people . 
7347	1721	is lie , ASPECT_US have 2 parties of rich and powerful , and none who are for poor or importantly ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS . 
7348	1722	When we really think about it , IT 's astonishing how influence ASPECT_BLUE_DOG in ASPECT_SENATE have . 
7349	1722	actions eventually led to ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION being dropped , resulting in poor legislation is major reason democrats are being -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ted on in polls . 
7350	1723	I do n't even think it is only ASPECT_BLUE_DOG anyways . 
7351	1723	Ultimately ASPECT_BLUE_DOG are beholden to ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC ASPECT_PARTY leadership . 
7352	1723	If party does not fund campaigns , will have hard time raising money , unless are particularly charismatic . 
7353	1723	TIME is fault of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC ASPECT_PARTY leadership . 
7354	1723	could have gotten better ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL through if had political will to do so , but did n't . 
7355	1724	Well 's included in whole situation but allow to do what want and we see what happened . 
7356	1724	If ASPECT_OBAMA 'm ASPECT_REID , ASPECT_PELOSI , ASPECT_OBAMA , and dnc leadership ASPECT_OBAMA tell to back or gonna 're gonna have to end up passing crappy legislation , which is what happened . 
7357	1724	Ultimately , one party is out of collective minds , and is too much of wuss to get anything substantial done . 
7358	1726	than conservatives . 
7359	1726	ASPECT_OBAMA has been at odds with ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE on almost issue since ASPECT_OBAMA took office . 
7361	1727	guy has been giving ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_SPEECH and pushing guy agenda at full speed since taking office . 
7362	1728	So YOU subtract 288 billion from stimulus and divide remainder by 2.5 million jobs will eventually be created and YOU get that job has cost 210,400.00 . 
7363	1728	you consider good ? 
7364	1728	YOU consider good reason to go another trillion dollars in debt ? 
7365	1728	new orleans levees ? 
7366	1728	YOU have spent billions to fix and improve levees over 100 years . 
7367	1728	Not 10 cents on dollar has ever reached levees . 
7369	1728	AND N.O. could teach ASPECT_CHICAGO things about corruption and graft , and is really saying . 
7370	1728	And infrastructure ? 
7371	1728	Indeed do repairs , was what `` shovel ready projects were supposed to be about . 
7372	1728	But then WHY did obummer ask , within month , for another 50 BILLION stimulus expressly for infrastructure repairs ? 
7373	1728	And 30 billion for teachers , and 26 billion for unemployment benefits to extend to 123 weeks ! 
7374	1728	Add amount in on cost of jobs and AMOUNT becomes much more than 210,400.00 per job . 
7375	1729	As matter of fact , I do . 
7376	1729	Would you prefer government had used money instead to directly hire people ? 
7377	1729	Or perhaps direct subsidy to everyone ? 
7378	1729	Oh wait , would n't be gasp socialism ? 
7379	1729	Of course efficient stimulus would be preferable , but unless you have suggestion on how to actually do , I really do n't see your point . 
7380	1729	stimulus was obviously far from perfect , and constructive criticism is always welcome . 
7381	1729	But it was necessary , and suggesting that we should n't have done STIMULUS is unreasonable , unless you seriously are saying that depression with 25 unemployment would be preferable to ASPECT_CURRENT_SITUATION . 
7382	1729	Sources please ? 
7383	1729	's quite claim you 're making , I 'd like to see to substantiate STIMULUS . 
7384	1729	Even if STIMULUS true , STIMULUS rather beside point . 
7385	1729	NO levees are simply symptom of larger problem . 
7386	1729	Arguing that if ASPECT_LA is corrupt and therefore does not spend la infrastructure money effectively we should not be spending money on infrastructure is rather akin to arguing that if ASPECT_CHICAGO fire department is corrupt and ineffective , WE should stop spending money on fire protection period . 
7387	1729	Well , for one , because because ASPECT_AMERICAN society of civil engineers estimates that 1.6 trillion is needed over five-year period to bring nation infrastructure to good condition . 
7388	1729	http : \ \/ \ \/ apps.asce.org \ \/ reportcard\/2005\/index . 
7388	1729	cfmLike I said , ASPECT_US has been neglecting I infrastructure for four decades . 
7389	1729	portion of we current infrastructure , especially interstate system , was built in 50 and 60 , with design life of around 50 years . 
7390	1729	You do math . 
7391	1729	ASPECT_STIMULUS_SPENDING , even with another 50 billion added on , is just drop in bucket of what WE really need . 
7392	1729	unpleasant reality , but unless you think that you not having to pay taxes is more important then little things like functional transportation , water , electricity , and sewage systems ... Yes , spending money on teachers is obviously massive waste ! 
7393	1729	Who needs schools ? 
7394	1729	education we kids will get on streets should be more then enough to keep us competitive for decades to come , right ? 
7395	1729	And unemployment ? 
7396	1729	Ha , if 's out of work , WORK obviously AND fault , and WE should let AND lazy asses starve ! 
7399	1729	WE need to deal with situation as SITUATION really is , and ignoring problems because you think AND should n't exist is both irresponsible and irrational . 
7400	1729	Oh , and incidentally - considering ASPECT_TEA_PARTY backed candidates have been winning and losing in ASPECT_REPUBLICAN primaries , and considering party primaries are notoriously more partisan and farther from center then nation as whole , I really think that claiming ASPECT_TEA_PARTY represents overwhelming majority of nation is bit of overstatement . 
7401	1730	I 'd prefer Govt stay out of `` FREE market . 
7402	1730	There is not one shred of PROOF that your statement is true . 
7403	1730	Is SHRED one possibility ? 
7404	1730	Yes , SHRED is ONE of possibilities . 
7405	1730	Just as economy is living , also could have recovered on . 
7406	1730	is not saying would have , just saying is also one of possibilities . 
7407	1730	814,000,000,000.00 that we did not and do not have . 
7408	1730	cent of could have gone to ASPECT_TAX_RELIEF . 
7409	1730	immediate 814 billion in hands of people might have really STIMULATED economy . 
7410	1730	is NOT alternative suggestion . 
7411	1730	just one of possibilities . 
7412	1730	govt interfering in business was major factor in down economy . 
7413	1730	Relying on people to fix problem people caused is hardly wisest move . 
7414	1730	And before you start with ASPECT_BUSH blaming , I mean politicians of both parties over decades of inexperienced and enlightened interference in business . 
7415	1730	What politicians did over time was to change business heads from can do leaders and fierce competitors , into business politicians in order to get along with Govt . 
7416	1730	And like politicians everywhere , business politicians went bad same as elected politicians do . 
7417	1730	If you want to substantiate TIME , do ASPECT_TINY_BIT of research on your and then you 'll know . 
7418	1730	What you are UNaware of is not I problem . 
7419	1730	And if I wish to say , I SAY UNAWARE . 
7420	1730	And nowhere did I say that levees should not be funded . 
7421	1730	Saying money got eaten up by corruption , which MONEY did , is not saying work should n't be done . 
7422	1730	federal highways and bridges , and interstate highways and bridges , are responsibilities of federal govt . 
7423	1730	All infrastructure is responsibility of state where road or bridge is located . 
7424	1730	Paying teachers is also responsibility of state in question . 
7425	1730	Dealing with reality was what I was telling you in regard to no levees . 
7426	1730	Living in unreal dreamworld is what is irresponsible and irrational . 
7427	1730	And looking to `` Big Brother govt for answers is irresponsible and irrational . 
7428	1730	We will see , wo n't WE ? 
7429	1730	And GOVT is ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , not ASPECT_TEA_PARTY . 
7430	1730	GOVT is diverse groups , not ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY . 
7431	1730	And GOVT is majority of ASPECT_AMERICA as WE will see . 
7432	1731	Sadly , Dan40 , not solution produced by free market is ideal . 
7433	1731	For example , DAN40 gave us cities with burning rivers , sucg as cuyahoga river in ASPECT_CLEVELAND , ASPECT_OHIO , which caught fire at least 13 times . 
7434	1731	DAN40 also gave ASPECT_US cars were frankly rolling death traps . 
7435	1731	ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT had to drag auto industry kicking and screaming into even putting in ASPECT_SEAT_BELT . 
7436	1731	And then there were continent spanning monopolies used ruthless ASPECT_BUSINESS_PRACTICE to crush potential competition , such as standard oil . 
7437	1731	Child labor , downright deadly working conditions , slums and poverty , ASPECT_US could go on for quite while . 
7438	1731	point is that free market is very powerful and efficient engine for creating material wealth , but 's POINT does . 
7439	1731	Both government and market are tools for creating prosperous society and dealing with society problems . 
7440	1731	Like tools , has strengths and weaknesses , and when used appropriately compliment . 
7441	1731	historical experience has shown that neither pure laissez-faire capitalism nor strict command economy work particularly well in world . 
7442	1731	We need system of checks and balances , where different institutions work toward strengths , and keep eye on . 
7443	1731	ASPECT_US 've been doing ASPECT_US best to research and reference ASPECT_US posts , if there 's ASPECT_US need to further substantiate , ASPECT_US apologize and ask that you please specify exactly which statement you mean . 
7444	1731	is ASPECT_US basic argument :1 - Around time of 2008 , us economy was on verge of major collapse , and faced very possibility of second Great Depression .2 - Since then , economy has moved back from brink and improved substantially , even though ASPECT_CURRENT_ECONOMIC_SITUATION is still far from good .3 - Great depression created 25 unemployment , thousands of ASPECT_BANK_FAILURE , and extensive homelessness in ASPECT_US . 
7445	1731	ASPECT_US did n't think of was in dispute . 
7446	1731	If you take issue with , please say so and ASPECT_US will track down sources for you .4 - ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL has had substantial impact on economy , stimulating both gdp and employment . 
7447	1731	ASPECT_US have already provided extensive substantiation for statement - if you need your memory refreshed , then just scroll up to ASPECT_US ASPECT_PREVIOU_POST . 
7448	1731	If you still disagree with ASPECT_US on point , then you either need to challenge ASPECT_US sources , provide sources of your to contradict ASPECT_US position , or challenge aspect of ASPECT_US reasoning . 
7449	1731	Simply saying that there 's no `` proof is not argument - there 's no as absolute proof of anything , simply evidence in support of or against position . 
7450	1731	ASPECT_US 've provided evidence in support of us position - RESPONSIBILITY 's now your responsibility to provide evidence in support of yours .5 - conclusion to be drawn is that we were in serious danger of seeing 25 unemployment , and that stimulus helped avert . 
7451	1731	Therefore , saying that stimulus should not have been passed is implying that you find running serious risk of 25 unemployment to be preferable to ASPECT_CURRENT_SITUATION with 10 unemployment . 
7452	1731	is simple and basic logic . 
7453	1731	If you find fault with , where , exactly ? 
7454	1731	ASPECT_US have never stated that 25 unemployment was certain . 
7455	1731	But future never is certain . 
7456	1731	So again ASPECT_US ask , do you think risking drastic collapse and massive human suffering is preferable to what we have ? 
7457	1731	If you 're saying that pure ASPECT_TAX_CUT are much more effective at stimulating economy then anything , then , you know , actually make argument for . 
7458	1731	economist say that ASPECT_TAX_CUT are one of several effective ways of stimulating economy . 
7459	1731	For example , in ASPECT_INDUSTRY_SURVEY of economists ASPECT_US cited above , `` Panelists were asked to consider nine of elements of ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGE and rank ASPECT_US effectiveness . 
7460	1731	three ranked as effective were infrastructure of physical nature -LRB- roads , bridges , etc -rrb- , unemployment benefits expansion , and personal tax-rate cuts . 
7461	1731	`` http : \ \/ \ \/ www.nabe.com\/graphweek\/2009\/gw090329.html As final note , ASPECT_US would point out when speaking of ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL as NOTE was passed , you tend to say things such as `` 814,000,000,000.00 that YOU did not and do not have . 
7462	1731	And yet you seemed to imply that you would have supported expenditure if EXPENDITURE had gone to ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
7463	1731	Perhaps ASPECT_US am misunderstanding you , but EXPENDITURE sounds very as if you 're implying that spending money is fine , so long as you get big piece of EXPENDITURE . 
7464	1731	On what basis do you assert that government interference led to recession ? 
7465	1731	ASPECT_US 've heard lots of theories about causes , although people seem to agree that collapse of ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE and failure to regulate derivatives market are major factors . 
7466	1731	What government interference are you talking about ? 
7467	1731	How exactly did COLLAPSE cause recession ? 
7468	1731	Explain , please . 
7469	1731	Saying that politics has somehow infected business in decades is frankly absurd - business and politics have gone arm in arm for time immemorial . 
7470	1731	Eve back in roman republic campaigns ran on money as much as modern ones do . 
7471	1731	Err , if you want to make statement , then RESPONSIBILITY your responsibility to back RESPONSIBILITY up , not mine . 
7472	1731	ASPECT_US 'm very curious where you got `` Less then 10 of money reaching levees figure . 
7473	1731	If ASPECT_US need help doing research , pm us and ASPECT_US 'll be happy to teach you . 
7474	1731	And ASPECT_US have to tell you , refusing to back up your statements makes help sound like you 're just making HELP up . 
7475	1731	Soooooo , SOOOOOO terrible for ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT to do , but if ASPECT_STATE_GOVERNMENT do , perfectly okay ? 
7476	1731	O_o ASPECT_US 'm sorry , but ASPECT_US really do n't follow your reasoning there . 
7477	1731	What difference does O_O make if O_O feds or states ? 
7478	1731	Ultimately O_O being paid for by ASPECT_TAX_DOLLAR anyway . 
7479	1731	ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT has greater financial resources then of states , and of states are legally or constitutionally unable to borrow money , even in emergency . 
7480	1731	GOVERNMENT only makes sense for level of government with deepest pockets to do heavy lifting during hard times . 
7481	1731	If you have plan for fighting corruption and inefficiency , please , share ! 
7482	1731	We need good ideas we can get on subject . 
7483	1731	And ASPECT_US 'm simply pointing out SUBJECT at least sounds as if your general solution to problems is to ignore them . 
7484	1731	If you have constructive solutions to offer , ASPECT_US 'd very much like to hear about THEM . 
7485	1731	As for `` Big brother ... Have you actually read 1984 ? 
7486	1731	ASPECT_US really do n't see how there 's comparison between government builds roads and bridges , pays teachers , and provides unemployment insurance and government has video surveillance in citizen home , requires everyone to participate in `` Daily hate , and uses physical and psychological torture to brainwash dissenters into believing that government is literally omnipotent . 
7487	1732	You seem to love to credit or blame me for saying things ME did not say . 
7488	1732	Your liberal prejudice prevents you from reading what was written , rather you decide what you think ME said . 
7489	1732	Which makes PREJUDICE impossible for ME to carry on intelligent debate with you when ME say things clearly and you decide ME 'm saying other than . 
7490	1732	So enjoy your liberal nonsense dreamland . 
7491	1732	If you ever bump into reality , come back and talk to ME . 
7492	1732	ME can not defend what you wish ME said since ME did not say what you wish ME said . 
7493	1732	And you list litany of bad things free market has done , but you list none of good things LITANY has done . 
7494	1732	And ASPECT_SEAT_BELT were not mandated by Govt until cars already had them . 
7495	1732	WEARING ASPECT_SEAT_BELT was mandated , not installing THEM . 
7496	1732	Same with padded dashes , and collapsible steering wheels and crush zones . 
7497	1732	installed in cars by AUTO men while politicians were chasing hookers on european junkets . 
7498	1732	When auto men got replaced by political savvy executives , safety was mandated in cars , and ASPECT_AMERICAN auto industry went down toilet . 
7499	1732	gas guzzlers were order of day , WHY ? 
7500	1732	Because ORDER was what sold ! 
7501	1732	Then until economy went to hell it was yuppie SUV 's that sold . 
7502	1732	Amazing how tree huggers can ignore HUGGERS driving about in 4 ton suburban assault vehicle and blame others for damaging Ma nature . 
7503	1732	free market has done bad , no two ways about . 
7504	1732	But MARKET also INVENTED ` ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS , ' free market came up with 40 hour week , not unions . 
7505	1732	Did you know ? 
7506	1732	And 8 hour day , also not union idea . 
7507	1732	Would you care to compare bad things Govt has done , with bad free market has done . 
7508	1732	Or do YOU live on street called ONE way ? 
7509	1732	Govt IS and has been , , bigger problem -LRB- with no good answers -RRB- compared to free market . 
7510	1732	And you list 1 2 3 4 5 like they were facts . 
7511	1732	THEY are not facts , THEY are liberal opinions . 
7512	1732	Look up difference . 
7513	1732	But you will read like ME said THEY are wrong . 
7514	1732	THEY are opinions , neither right or wrong , but not facts . 
7515	1734	Yes , I will vote in 2012 , but not for I party I have been with since 18 years old ! 
7516	1734	sinister has taken over I party and I know ! 
7517	1734	I will not be part of destruction of ASPECT_AMERICA I know and love , I love country and will be true too 18 ! 
7518	1736	Your honest man , man hope smart too ... Jollee 
7519	1737	And I refuse to vote for ASPECT_PUTIN ! 
7520	1739	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- ASPECT_MOD_EDIT : Flamebaiting -RRB- -RRB- -RRB- You say ASPECT_STIMULUS_SPENDING SAVED economy . 
7521	1739	is opinion , not fact . 
7522	1739	When I say that economies have recovered on -LRB- . 
7523	1739	IS fact . 
7524	1739	But OPINION is not saying that present economy would have recovered on ECONOMY . 
7525	1739	We DO NOT know either way , is fact . 
7526	1739	I OPINION , and always stated as , is that Stimulus was and is waste of money . 
7527	1739	When I said IF 3.5 million jobs were created , -LRB- and I opinion is that they were not and will not be -RRB- then jobs cost 232,000.00 . 
7528	1739	ME believe million ok for Govt to `` create jobs at cost of 232,000.00 , and also OK for Govt to increase taxes on who are `` rich . 
7529	1739	Meaning make over 200,000.00 . 
7530	1739	So million ok for Govt to ` create ' jobs cost 32,000.00 MORE than `` rich line ? 
7531	1739	`` When ME said Govt could just as well given whole ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY to unemployed , me clearly said is NOT alternative suggestion . 
7532	1739	Yet your prejudicial interpretation blinded YOUR to and attempted to ridicule ME for making suggestion . 
7533	1739	Which me did not make . 
7534	1739	So since SO are unable to see or hear , or read , REALITY , and ME am unable to wander in your utopian dreamworld because reality keeps biting ME on ass , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Forget UNABLE . 
7535	1741	Given fact economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 jobs month when stimulus was passed and stimulus now growing and ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR is creating jobs , given that bi-partisan cbo estimates that millions of jobs have been saved or created by stimulus , it is opinion is well supported by fact . 
7536	1742	You statement is ALSO opinion . 
7537	1742	And ASPECT_CBO is not bi-partisan , unless you consider ASPECT_CBO speaking FOR party in power to be bi-partisan . 
7538	1742	And ASPECT_CBO was correct last , , , , , , , , , , , , , , WHEN ?? 
7539	1742	They make 10 year projections . 
7540	1742	Kindly name cbo projection of 10 or years vintage is correct . 
7541	1743	Supported by facts . 
7542	1743	Sure it is . 
7543	1743	IT 's not controlled by party in power You confuse projections versus reporting past events . 
7544	1744	passes for originality in liberal world . 
7545	1745	Just about as as post to which it responded . 
7546	1746	NET : you can not name accurate projection of ASPECT_CBO . 
7547	1746	You may use cbo projections since net inception . 
7548	1746	Is there single one proved accurate ? 
7549	1746	And since there IS NOT , why should citizen pay attention to cbo projections . 
7550	1746	We know one about projections from experience , THING WILL BE WRONG . 
7551	1746	party in power gives ASPECT_CBO parameters want ASPECT_CBO to consider . 
7552	1746	ASPECT_CBO simply projects on what ASPECT_CBO is given . 
7553	1746	party in power gives ASPECT_CBO program that party estimates will cost trillion over 10 years . 
7554	1746	tell ASPECT_CBO that will raise taxes in 8 years to get needed trillion in funding . 
7555	1746	cbo ` projects ' program to be deficit neutral . 
7556	1746	You know , I know , ASPECT_CBO knows , dust mites in ASPECT_CONGRESSIONAL carpet know , that no ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE will be passed . 
7557	1746	But is not ASPECT_CBO job , parameters say program will be funded so cbo projects deficit neutral . 
7558	1746	silly sleight of hand by whichever party is in power . 
7559	1747	No one is talking about projections . 
7560	1747	Why are you ? 
7561	1747	Proof that cbo estimates of ASPECT_JOB_CREATION are based on parameters given to ASPECT_CBO by Democrats , please . 
7562	1749	Talk about seeing world through rose colored glasses . 
7563	1749	Once again you present OPINIONS AS FACTS . 
7564	1749	FACT -LRB- kt -rrb- n1 . 
7565	1749	truth verifiable from experience or observation.o-pin-ion -LRB- - pnyn -RRB- n. 1 . 
7566	1749	belief or conclusion held with confidence but not substantiated by positive knowledge or proof : ny times link is useless , they are advertising agency for liberals AND THEY are rapidly going out of business for THEY stupid choice of yellow journalism . 
7567	1749	nabe link is clearly opinion , no facts in evidence . 
7568	1749	But amazingly , they opinion is that there is 10.3 CHANCE that Stimulus shortened recession . 
7569	1749	60.3 CHANCE that Stimulus had `` modest effect on shortening recession . 
7570	1749	And 29.4 CHANCE that Stimulus had little or NO effect . 
7571	1749	Are you sure 's info you wish to use to justify expenditure of nearly trillion dollars that we do n't have ? 
7572	1749	hint : CHANCE does not translate into FACT . 
7573	1749	And link to ASPECT_BEN_STEIN opinion . 
7574	1749	Did you even read LINK ? 
7575	1749	ASPECT_STEIN wrote that 3\/19\/10 . 
7576	1749	Does not voice strong support for Stimulus then , nor strong opposition to 3\/19\/10 either . 
7577	1749	In case , again , FACT is opinion not fact . 
7578	1749	fact is that economy is in almost exactly place today as ECONOMY was on 3\/19\/10 . 
7579	1749	7 months later and improvements to economy are infinitesimally small . 
7580	1749	And just as good case can be made for Stimulus slowing recovery as can be made for speeding CASE up . 
7581	1749	As can case be made for natural recovery taking place on CASE . 
7582	1749	As your links bear out ! 
7583	1749	Obummer could n't look up respect on ASPECT_GOOGLE let alone deserve ! 
7584	1749	I 'll elaborate if you 're confused about I opinion . 
7585	1749	OBUMMER IS closed minded socialist completely lost in academic theories with no clue of practicality . 
7586	1749	But is obummer considered and very experienced opinion . 
7587	1750	Yeeeees , ASPECT_DAN , ASPECT_LEHMAN am well aware of difference between opinions and facts . 
7588	1750	ASPECT_LEHMAN also know that facts always come with degree of doubt and uncertainty . 
7589	1750	And opinions are n't created equal , and do n't exist in vacuum . 
7590	1750	There are no certainties in life , no absolutes . 
7591	1750	We need to weigh evidence in particular case and decide what best conclusion is based on information available to WE . 
7592	1750	ASPECT_LEHMAN present evidence as ASPECT_LEHMAN find PRESENT , and invite everyone to reach THERE conclusions and present THERE arguments . 
7593	1750	ASPECT_LEHMAN do n't change evidence to suit lehman point of view , and ASPECT_LEHMAN do n't cherry pick . 
7594	1750	lehman change lehman point of view to suit evidence . 
7595	1750	If you want to convince LEHMAN , then show LEHMAN . 
7596	1750	show lehman facts , show LEHMAN your argument . 
7597	1750	LEHMAN 'm getting little tired of people who say that ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE that ever presents anything then disagree with is mouthpiece for side . 
7598	1750	And yes , there are plenty of liberals guilty of as well . 
7599	1750	ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE does n't challenge you and make you question your positions at least from time to time is n't very good ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE . 
7600	1750	In case , in instance , ASPECT_NY_TIME is simply reporting on research done by ASPECT_MOODY ASPECT_ET ASPECT_AL. . 
7601	1750	If you want to discount information , ORIGINATOR originator , not reporter , you need to address . 
7602	1750	As for ASPECT_NABE survey , yes you 're right , SURVEY is matter of opinion . 
7603	1750	opinions of of professional economists , who study stuff for living . 
7604	1750	And yes , LEHMAN did read ASPECT_BEN_STEIN article . 
7605	1750	As LEHMAN stated when LEHMAN originally posted link , point is not that ASPECT_MR ASPECT_STEIN is giving enthusiastic endorsement of stimulus - clearly ASPECT_STEIN is not - point is that very conservative economist of high standing like ASPECT_MR ASPECT_STEIN , who has criticized stimulus on occasions , would seem to imply that stimulus was both necessary and at least effective . 
7606	1750	`` But losses to economy following failure of ASPECT_LEHMAN have been on order of hundreds of billions , maybe trillions . 
7607	1750	Certainly rescue and ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGE needed in wake of lehman failure have amounted to trillions . 
7608	1750	`` And if just as good case can be made that stimulus slowed down recovery , then make STIMULUS already . 
7609	1750	LEHMAN must admit that LEHMAN am rather puzzled by your insistence that stimulus has hurt economy in face of evidence to contrary . 
7610	1750	If YOUR have evidence supports your position , why have n't LEHMAN shown us ? 
7611	1750	And if YOUR do n't , why do YOUR hold so steadfastly to EVIDENCE ? 
7612	1750	And as LEHMAN pointed out before , 37 of ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL was ASPECT_TAX_BREAK . 
7613	1750	If ASPECT_BILL did n't help economy , implies that ASPECT_TAX_CUT do n't help economy . 
7614	1751	If you wish , you may add additional 10,000 words , or million words . 
7615	1751	But opinion will still be opinion . 
7616	1751	You said 37 of Stimulus was ASPECT_TAX_BREAK . 
7617	1751	I have opinion on . 
7618	1751	full amount of Stimulus is now admitted to be 814 billion . 
7619	1751	37 of is 301,180,000,000.00 . 
7620	1751	I opinion is that you should recheck your claim . 
7621	1752	There I fixed it for you . 
7622	1753	Calling my position opinion -LRB- which position is -RRB- does not make POSITION less well founded or grounded in facts . 
7623	1753	You seem to think that if you call opinion , means OPINION arbitrary , and you can just as legitimately take position on matter . 
7624	1753	may be true if you 're debating whether chili or stir fry is tastier . 
7625	1753	OPINION 's not if you 're debating if ASPECT_EARTH is flat or round . 
7626	1753	And OPINION 's not when we 're debating whether or not ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL helped economy . 
7627	1753	Stop trying to hide behind flimsy rhetorical devices , and either show WE your evidence or admit you do n't have . 
7628	1753	As for numbers ... -LRB- shrug -RRB- nominal costs and revenues related to legislation is \*\* always \*\* estimate . 
7629	1753	numbers ca n't be determined until well after legislation has run legislation course - for bill . 
7630	1753	And there will always be differences between estimate and , 's why ESTIMATE called estimate . 
7631	1753	Your point being ? 
7632	1754	is your quote : `` And as pointed out before , 37 of ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL was ASPECT_TAX_BREAK . 
7633	1754	If QUOTE did n't help economy , implies that ASPECT_TAX_CUT do n't help economy . 
7634	1754	`` Now eyes are not what YOUR once were , but do not see word estimate anywhere . 
7635	1754	But if you wish to retract and now call NOW estimate , OK . 
7636	1754	And will say 301 billion in ASPECT_TAX_BREAK is wildly insane estimate . 
7637	1754	Now can statement be opinion and also be true ? 
7638	1754	Yes of course opinion can prove true . 
7639	1754	equally true for both opinions and YOU . 
7640	1756	ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , formally known as ASPECT_AMERICAN recovery and reinvestment act , is meant to create jobs and boost economy . 
7641	1756	BILL cost 787 billion , including 499 billion to fund new roads , hire teachers and generally keep people employed , and about 288 billion in ASPECT_TAX_BREAK to individuals and businesses . 
7642	1756	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.politifact.com \ \/ truth-o-me ... hird-tax-cuts\/288\/787 = 37 . 
7643	1756	ASPECT_TAX_CUT were 37 of ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL . 
7644	1756	BILL lower if you count additional stimulus monies added since then . 
7645	1758	No way ! 
7646	1758	like asking me if ME want ASPECT_AMERICA too fail ! 
7647	1759	ASPECT_OBAMA also needs another nobel peace prize . 
7648	1760	ASPECT_OBAMA did not deserve one ... . 
7650	1761	I know . 
7651	1761	Just being sarcastic . 
7652	1763	Do you people just drink Kool-ade your brainwashers feed you . 
7653	1763	Do you not independently try to find out TRUTH for yourselves ? 
7654	1763	Why do I listen to both ASPECT_FOX and msnbc ? 
7655	1763	Because I want to hear both sides and decide who is lying MORE . 
7656	1763	Here are sources for you to peruse . 
7657	1763	NONE of HERE right leaning or tea party connected : http : \ \/ \ \/ washingtonindependent.com \ \/ wp - ... 10\/08\/cfrb . 
7657	1763	pngfrom bloomberg : aug. 20 -LRB- bloomberg -rrb- -- Congressional Budget office lowered aug. estimate for cost of ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION &#8217; s economic stimulus package to 814 billion from 862 billion . 
7658	1763	ASPECT_CBO adjusted estimate because ESTIMATE &#8220; revised estimate economic and technical assumptions , &#8221; agency said in report issued yesterday . 
7659	1763	from ASPECT_WASHINGTON_POST , definite liberal publication : ASPECT_CBO cautioned that act effects are expected to `` gradually diminish during second half of 2010 and beyond , leaving ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR to pick up slack in economy is already showing signs of deteriorating rapidly . 
7660	1763	On bright side , -LRB- now FUNNY -RRB- ASPECT_CBO revised cost of package downward : Originally estimated to cost 787 billion over 10 years , stimulus was later estimated to cost 862 billion . 
7661	1763	But in report released Tuesday , ASPECT_CBO said REPORT now expects measure to cost about 814 billion through 2019 , with 70 percent of costs incurred by end of year . 
7662	1763	from cbo report : You will find ASPECT_CBO `` s revised estimate of arra act `` ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL on page 9 . 
7663	1763	They estimate bill to cost 787 billion at passage , revised cost upward to 862 billion months later and have now settled on lower estimate of 814 . 
7665	1763	Do you want proof that you have no clue that your masters are lying to you ? 
7666	1763	I could , if I wished , cite 20 to 50 neutral sources . 
7667	1763	But you 'd be better off doing RESEARCH , and learning on your . 
7668	1763	Your misconceptions have become bore . 
7669	1763	Would you please start learning what is really happening in country or STFU . 
7670	1764	jollee people OF ASPECT_USA are entity that you can trust , unfortunately ! 
7672	1766	WRONG again . 
7673	1766	Misinterpreting opinion as fact . 
7674	1766	OPINION says it is EXPECTED that effects will be diminishing over time . 
7675	1766	ASSUMES there was effect , OPINION does not prove ANYTHING . 
7676	1766	Is english not you native language ? 
7677	1766	report of ASPECT_CBO neither proves there was or proves there was not effect caused by stimulus . 
7678	1766	Remember ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DOWNTURN have happened throughout history . 
7679	1766	had kind of ASPECT_GOVT_INTERVENTION , others had NO intervention whatsoever . 
7680	1766	eventually recovered , NONE had ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL . 
7681	1766	one with ASPECT_GOVT_INTERVENTION was Depression . 
7682	1766	With massive and unrelenting ASPECT_GOVT_INTERVENTION , depression lasted from early 30 until END OF WWII . 
7683	1766	help ! 
7684	1766	When Stimulus was passed , DAY , I predicted that recession just got extended by 2 years minimum . 
7685	1766	Now 21 months later , economy is still but flat . 
7686	1766	Was I prediction correct ? 
7687	1766	Not yet , but we 're getting there . 
7688	1766	And when recession really does end , you may ABSOLUTELY count on unpleasant inflation . 
7689	1767	-LRB- Looks amused -RRB- So you 're happy to quote ASPECT_CBO when you feel ASPECT_CBO supporting your position , but when I point out ASPECT_CBO actually doing opposite , cbo suddenly becomes opinion ? 
7690	1767	Yes , yes , I know you 're just trying to turn I own liberal brainwashing propaganda against I , or . 
7691	1767	-LRB- Incidentally , 's sarcasm , and not intended as serious representation of your position . 
7692	1767	And are shouting and ASPECT_PERSONAL_INSULT really necessary ? 
7693	1767	They really do n't strengthen your argument at all , you know . -RRB- 
7694	1767	And as I 've already explained , there 's no as absolute proof , and single piece of evidence certainly does n't `` prove anything . 
7695	1767	But when multiple lines of evidence point to , you can have pretty good amount of confidence in conclusion . 
7696	1767	And so far evidence is pointing to ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL having helped economy . 
7697	1767	And yes , you are right that economy will almost certainly completely recover on ECONOMY . 
7698	1767	But I do n't think 's reason to not use tools at disposal to help situation . 
7699	1767	historical corrections : ASPECT_OBAMA stimulus policy has been pretty much as used by Presidents of both parties in recession since Great depression . 
7700	1767	details vary , but overall strategy is - ASPECT_CUT_TAX , extend unemployment benefits , increase spending , do whatever 's necessary to get money flowing again . 
7701	1767	Great depression is generally considered to have lasted from 1929 until start of WWII , not end . 
7702	1767	Depression hit DEPRESSION lowest point in 1933 , and after began slow but steady improvement . 
7703	1767	economic conditions had improved lot by 1937 , when conservative coalition convinced FDR that economy had improved enough that ECONOMY was time to return to normal policy . 
7704	1767	new deal programs were rolled back , taxes increased , and spending cut to try to balance ASPECT_FEDERAL_BUDGET . 
7705	1767	result was second crash , where industrial production fell almost 30 in months , and unemployment went from 14.3 in 1937 to 19.0 in 1938 . 
7706	1767	And no , your prediction has proven to be wrong . 
7707	1767	Right now economy is stagnant , not in recession . 
7708	1767	Things are n't good , but NO 're not getting worse . 
7709	1767	True , makes little difference to folks who are out of work , but economy booming makes little difference to out of work . 
7710	1767	Just to clarify , flat = stagnant , going down = recession , going up = recovery . 
7711	1767	To sum up , as bad as things are now , evidence indicates that without ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , things would be appreciably worse . 
7712	1767	As for policies being advocated by Republicans ... As far as I can tell , FOLKS are saying FOLKS want to cut taxes and balance budget . 
7713	1767	Setting aside for moment that in order to balance budget , you 'll realistically have to raise taxes and \* cut spending , policies are awful lot like ones Hoover followed at beginning of Depression , and that conservatives coalition convinced FDR to try in 1937 . 
7714	1767	Balancing budget will be short term hit to economy - TERM always has been . 
7715	1768	REALITY is strength my arguments needs . 
7716	1768	And at no time and in no way have MY attempted to use cbo statements as facts . 
7717	1768	Making error is strictly your domain . 
7718	1768	Whether MY agree with anything ASPECT_CBO says or not , does not in way assign factual credence to not opinions\/projections . 
7719	1768	my always know not reports are conjecture , not fact . 
7720	1768	When you agree with NOT , suddenly NOT are stating facts . 
7721	1768	's silly . 
7722	1768	Unemployment remains at 9.6 for September . 
7723	1768	Essentially flat for of 2010 . 
7724	1768	Talk about your phantom ` recovery ' to people . 
7725	1768	Read bls report . 
7726	1768	Especially part says that no longer counted as unemployed because UNEMPLOYED have stopped looking for job is now 503,000 higher than September 2009 , WHEN figure was 697,000 . 
7727	1768	part now 1,200,000 . 
7728	1768	Stimulus is serving well , is stimulus not ? 
7729	1768	Perhaps MY should point out that are statistics from ASPECT_BUREAU ASPECT_OF ASPECT_LABOR_STATISTIC and are supposed to be facts , not opinions , since you seem to have great difficulty with distinctions . 
7730	1769	Flat might not be much of recovery . 
7731	1769	But RECESSION 's not recession either . 
7732	1769	In fact RECESSION leaning more towards recovery than recession because we are growing . 
7733	1769	WE 're just not growing at fast enough rate . 
7734	1770	And what proof do liberals have that very slow , almost non-existent `` recovery in not caused by natural recovery as HAS happened times in past . 
7735	1770	Is RECOVERY stimulus or is RECOVERY wounds healing on LIBERALS own ? 
7736	1770	Neither you nor I can PROVE either premise to be true or false . 
7737	1770	oBum is first to point out , `` FIRST 'S not my fault . 
7738	1770	No matter what question . 
7739	1770	So maybe recovery , what little there is of RECOVERY , is not YOU `` fault , either . 
7740	1771	No proof is needed . 
7741	1771	BASIC basic understanding ASPECT_STIMULUS_SPENDING increases consumer demand and thus results in shorter recession . 
7742	1771	Yes economy theoretically could have recovered on ECONOMY . 
7743	1771	But there is no way that after financial collapse and collapse of 3 largest job produces , auto companies , we would have been out of recession less than 2 years after YEARS started . 
7744	1771	It is just economically impossible for recession to end in less than 2 years without ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE . 
7745	1771	In no previous example where WE 've had complete financial failure and major industry failure at time and FAILURE has recovered on EXAMPLE in less than 2 years . 
7746	1771	just does n't happen . 
7747	1771	EXAMPLE 's not possible to do . 
7748	1771	ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INTERVENTION ended recession faster and thus saved ASPECT_WE_MONEY . 
7749	1771	I do n't know why you are so against saving money . 
7750	1772	And fires will go out on also . 
7751	1772	But we usually think best douse THEIR with water to reduce overall damage . 
7752	1772	I predicted 2 years ago if Economy recovered , Conservatives would say ECONOMY would have done so faster without stimulas . 
7753	1772	If ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION had n't pushed stimulas plan and economy was 4 times worse than ECONOMY is now , of CONSERVATIVES still with jobs would be blaming his administration . 
7754	1772	I do know that 2 years ago , I 401k was half size AGO is now , people were wondering whether ASPECT_GM would survive year , whether ASPECT_BANKING_INDUSTRY would go under , and how far housing prices would tumble . 
7755	1772	There was panic in air . 
7756	1772	Now there is no panic . 
7757	1772	ASPECT_BANKING_INDUSTRY is stable , ASPECT_GM is working , housing prices have largely stabilized and industry is picking up - slowly . 
7760	1772	But recession was years in making , and years recovery will not happen overnight . 
7761	1773	So we should have squirted water on economy ? 
7762	1773	Or throw money at forest fires ? 
7763	1773	Or can WE make arguments are not pure nonsense . 
7764	1773	YES , water on fires . 
7765	1773	NO economy is not fire . 
7766	1773	And I predicted that economy would take longer to recover due to govt interference . 
7767	1773	Well economy HAS NOT recovered . 
7768	1773	So much for ASPECT_US ` prediction . ' 
7769	1773	majority of us with open minds ARE blaming his `` administration . 
7770	1773	MAJORITY , and HIS , should have noticed but so far you have n't . 
7771	1773	nov. 3 might be wake up call . 
7772	1773	I have of investments are still below peak , well below . 
7773	1773	And ASPECT_GM did not survive . 
7774	1773	ASPECT_GM went bankrupt and was WRONGLY bailed out by Govt . 
7775	1773	ASPECT_GM paid back ASPECT_BAILOUT_MONEY from 50 billion in stock that taxpayers bought without agreeing to buy . 
7776	1773	stock is today worth 75 cents share . 
7777	1773	There is plan to reissue `` gm stock in IPO soon . 
7778	1773	If IPO does not generate high participation and prices . 
7779	1773	WE , taxpayers , stand to lose or substantial parts of 50 billion . 
7780	1773	I DO have to agree with you about PANIC . 
7781	1773	But IPO was panic by politicians of both parties , led by Democrats . 
7782	1773	Democrats passed both ASPECT_TARP and Stimulus . 
7783	1773	ASPECT_TARP had ASPECT_REPUBLICAN help . 
7784	1773	Stimulus was purely Democrat panic . 
7785	1773	And panic was what they both were and are . 
7786	1773	ASPECT_TARP was 700 billion to purchase or insure sub prime bundled non-secure `` securities . 
7787	1773	Odd since fannie & freddie insured `` securities even before bubble burst . 
7788	1773	We did n't buy securities , WE lent money to banks . 
7789	1773	Why was money panic by politicians ? 
7790	1773	WE only put out about half 700 billion . 
7791	1773	shows knee jerk panic . 
7792	1773	And WE will lose just under 100 billion on deal when DEAL said and done . 
7793	1773	stimulus panic , pretty much . 
7794	1773	was to go to ` shovel ready ' projects . 
7795	1773	went to bailing out Democrat states debts . 
7796	1773	has been added to ASPECT_NUMEROU_TIME and now totals over trillion dollars . 
7797	1773	remains unspent . 
7798	1773	Could Stimulus be responsible for ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOB ? 
7799	1773	Yes , stimulus `` could be responsible for of ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR_JOB . 
7800	1773	Is there proof that Stimulus is responsible for even one private sector job ? 
7801	1773	NO. . 
7801	1773	What we do have is FACT that WE are now in slowest recovery since Great depression . 
7802	1773	Not very Stimulating stimulus , is NO. ? 
7803	1773	I again agree , recession was DECADES in making and wholly fault of bad legislation passed by both Republicans and democrats over years . 
7804	1773	So YES recovery will take time . 
7805	1773	Expecting who caused RECOVERY -LRB- politicians -RRB- to fix RECOVERY is just stupid . 
7806	1774	We are not growing . 
7807	1774	Take off glasses . 
7808	1776	So we pass 700 billion in tarp and over 1 trillion in Stimulus to get `` lean . 
7809	1776	lien we got is AGAINST countries future . 
7810	1777	're -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -lrb- -RRB- ing straight we did ! 
7811	1777	And WE saved trillions doing it ! 
7812	1777	Do you know how drawn out recession costs country !? 
7813	1777	Why are you so against saving money ! 
7814	1778	All ASPECT_BOEHNER republicans promise is more of neocon bratboy\/cheney egotistic , military saber rattling in name of `` WAR on terror ! 
7815	1778	when ASPECT_IRAQ was simplistic power grab to corner and dominate oil market fueled by ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY of greed redistributed wealth earned by stealing jobs from working class middle american to feed gluttony of of top 2 ASPECT_REPUBLICAN oligarchy striving to turn world into version of united business nations ; and deluded tea party republicans who wrap THEIR in stars and stripes , carry guns to rallies to convince are in tune with ASPECT_AMERICAN constitution not do n't understand but probably have never read . 
7816	1778	ASPECT_IRAQ is obvious from home made signs at hate filled rallies that get THEIR Constitution `` education from mr. magoo-like , ASPECT_GLENN_BECK , cry baby synthetic mormon whose shriveled brain is fried from alcohol and drug abuse , much like magoo-like mentor and collaborator , ASPECT_RUSH_LIMBAUGH . 
7817	1778	guys are so charismatic and appealing guys turn `` red-necks and `` bimbos into elite . 
7818	1778	Republicans have n't clue or produced one as to how to get country out of `` depression\/recession other than to bombastically whine about and with shrill , moronic complaints about how `` slow Democrats are at COUNTRY . 
7819	1778	In point of fact , Republicans know how to do is to drive country into recession -LRB- Hoover , Reagan\/Bush and now bratboy -rrb- . 
7820	1778	GUYS are least competent to devise plan to get red-necks country out of one . 
7821	1780	She did n't say words of course . 
7822	1780	But SHE did claim that ASPECT_ALASKA proximity to ASPECT_RUSSIA gives she foreign ASPECT_POLICY_EXPERIENCE . 
7823	1780	-LRB- Which of course proximity does no -RRB- 
7824	1781	ASPECT_PALIN was Mayor of alaskan city . 
7825	1781	ASPECT_PALIN was Governor of ASPECT_ALASKA . 
7826	1781	Both are executive positions . 
7827	1781	Maybe not `` big time executive positions , but still executive positions . 
7828	1781	Did you note ASPECT_BH_OBAMA had not one second of experience at type of ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_POSITION in ASPECT_OBAMA_LIFE ? 
7829	1781	Nor had ASPECT_OBAMA had one second of experience at anything approaching ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_POSITION . 
7830	1781	And since jan. 09 , it is painfully obvious that ASPECT_OBAMA was not ready for job , and it is equally obvious that ASPECT_OBAMA is not learning on job . 
7831	1782	One with thousand people . 
7832	1782	And she left ONE in ASPECT_MASSIVE_AMOUNT of debt . 
7834	1782	And SHE could n't take pressure of job and quit . 
7835	1782	she sudden resignation cost state hundreds of thousands . 
7836	1782	she experience includes being failed mayor and quitter governor . 
7837	1782	If 's your best defense for palin then 's sad . 
7838	1782	Actually MAYOR was incharge of staff when MAYOR was community organizer and mayor was president of harvard law review . 
7839	1782	are two ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_POSITION . 
7840	1782	And regardless mayor is now president of ASPECT_UNITED ASPECT_STATES . 
7841	1782	MAYOR now has ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_EXPERIENCE in mayor pinky than ASPECT_PALIN has in her failure of career . 
7842	1782	MAYOR ended recession in 200 days . 
7843	1782	If 's not success I do n't know what is . 
7844	1783	utopian dreaming . 
7845	1783	recession is not over regardless of whatever silliness liberal academics wish to claim . 
7846	1783	With regularity and stealth , both ASPECT_CBO and ASPECT_BLS keep DOWNGRADING academics previous conclusions to less growth and fewer jobs . 
7847	1783	Quietly ACADEMICS revise ACADEMICS earlier overstatements downward . 
7848	1783	Try looking up sources , instead of liberal loony sources . 
7849	1783	And I consider both ASPECT_CBO and ASPECT_BLS to be liberal biased sources . 
7850	1784	Even wall street journal ... conservative leaning business news report ... Says recession ended in 2009 . 
7851	1784	Within 200 days of ASPECT_OBAMA coming to office . 
7852	1784	Thanks to ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_QUICK_ACTION . 
7853	1784	http : \ \/ \ \/ online.wsj.com \ \/ article\/SB1000 ... 644231892 . 
7853	1784	htmlThere is your non-liberal source . 
7854	1784	Sorry to shatter your world view . 
7855	1784	Ever since ASPECT_OBAMA stimulus passed economy has been growing . 
7856	1784	ASPECT_OBAMA quick action saved economy . 
7857	1785	Another liberal reads through rose colored glasses . 
7858	1785	ASPECT_WSJ did not determine recession was over , they simply repeated conclusion reached by : `` national bureau of economic research business cycle dating committee , group of academic economists `` Copied from wsj article . 
7859	1785	So wsj originating source is group of liberal academics . 
7860	1785	THEY OPINIONS are not facts . 
7861	1786	-LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -lrb- -RRB- ed economists with fancy book learnings . 
7862	1786	Guess what buddy . 
7863	1786	truth has liberal bias . 
7864	1786	Get used to TRUTH . 
7865	1786	Ignoring truth does not make TRUTH untrue . 
7866	1786	respectable source , conservative or liberal leaning , says recession ended in June 2009 . 
7867	1786	CONSERVATIVE ended by textbook definition of what recession is . 
7868	1786	shrinking economy . 
7869	1786	You ca n't have recession when we have had multiple quarters in row of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH . 
7870	1787	What growth are you speaking of ? 
7871	1787	Unemployment rate is pretty much stagnant . 
7872	1787	debt is increasing . 
7873	1788	Growth as in definition of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH . 
7874	1788	GDPUnemployment is lagging indicator . 
7875	1788	In words unemployment stays high long after recession has ended . 
7876	1788	And debt increases in prosperity periods as well . 
7877	1789	So ADVOCATE are advocate of borrowing and spending one way out of debt . 
7878	1789	Good luck with . 
7879	1789	There is hurricane named inflation heading for your wallet . 
7880	1789	Here is interesting graph from govt agency calculates GDP . 
7881	1789	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.bea.gov\/national\/nipaweb\/GovView.asp.Plea se note widening gap between income and expenditures of ASPECT_U_GOVT . 
7882	1789	gap noticeably widens with installation of Democrat controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS in jan 2007 and widens under reckless spending of obummer . 
7883	1789	Yes ASPECT_BUSH spent way too much too . 
7884	1789	But shows that against income ASPECT_BUSH was miser compared to `` riverboat barak . 
7885	1789	`` also cracks barak up liberals wish to blame ASPECT_BUSH for expenditures through 9\/30\/2009 , end of ASPECT_BUSH fiscal year . 
7886	1789	But want to credit obummer for imagined ` good ' happened between jan 20 09 and 9\/30\/09 . 
7887	1792	Why does truth bother liberals so much ? 
7888	1792	Democrat politicians have accused ASPECT_BECK of lying in general . 
7889	1792	NONE have ever pointed out ASPECT_SPECIFIC_LIE or even attempted to call DEMOCRAT on anything . 
7890	1792	ASPECT_VAN_JONES , exposed by ASPECT_FOX , not liberal lamestream media . 
7891	1792	ASPECT_ACORN , exposed by ASPECT_FOX , not liberal lamestream media . 
7892	1792	numerous others . 
7893	1792	Presently , ASPECT_FOX exposed that NY has yet to send out absentee ballots to troops serving overseas . 
7894	1792	One cable network actually does reporting and you fear TROOPS . 
7895	1792	If you had intelligence to watch TROOPS , you 'd know TROOPS are fair network on TV . 
7896	1792	Yes troops lean little right , but still much more fair than far left lamestream media . 
7897	1792	-LRB- Which I watch to know what TROOPS 're doing -RRB- And lately TROOPS seem to be tiring of obummer bs too . 
7898	1793	-LRB- quote = dan40 ; 3028606 -RRB- Why does truth bother liberals so much ? 
7899	1793	Democrat politicians have accused ASPECT_BECK of lying in general . 
7900	1793	NONE have ever pointed out ASPECT_SPECIFIC_LIE or even attempted to call DEMOCRAT on anything . 
7901	1793	ASPECT_VAN_JONES did wrong . 
7902	1793	Fox news slandered JONES . 
7903	1793	Calling jones communist . 
7904	1793	When in reality jones 's been one of outspoken eco capitalists in world . 
7905	1793	Turns out everything ASPECT_FOX ASPECT_NEWS said was lie . 
7906	1793	And kids who video taped them are in big trouble for editing kids footage to make non criminal act into criminal act . 
7907	1793	ASPECT_ACORN was never accused of wrong doing after investigation showed that ASPECT_FOX and amateur journalists lied . 
7908	1794	-LRB- quote = TheTaoOfBill ; 3028910 -RRB- link ... And how did ASPECT_VAN_JONES do no wrong ? 
7911	1795	's not at what advocate . 
7912	1795	You clearly do not understand economics . 
7913	1795	advocate low taxes high spending in recessions . 
7914	1795	high taxes low spending in prosperities . 
7915	1795	's sane way to run national budget . 
7916	1795	Republicans like high spending low taxes 24\/7 . 
7917	1795	Do you think 24\/7 would be good financial idea for you to go to your boss and say `` YOU need you to cut YOU salary by 33 . 
7918	1795	Then go out and buy YOU ASPECT_NEW_CAR . 
7919	1795	See how works for YOU . 
7920	1795	As long as demand is low YOU are pretty much immune from inflation . 
7921	1795	And when demand starts to pick up again then CAR will take is for fed to raise interest rates to keep inflation under control . 
7922	1795	Inflation is not nearly threat to YOU economy as low demand is . 
7923	1795	YOU run greater risk of deflation if YOU do at . 
7924	1795	graph does n't show GDP ... expense part of graph is n't problem . 
7925	1795	If YOU look that part of graph is going up at constant and steady rate . 
7926	1795	is to be expected . 
7927	1795	As YOU population grows so do YOU expenses . 
7928	1795	very clear problem is sudden drop in revenue . 
7929	1795	Democrats are experts at raising revenue of country . 
7930	1795	Because ASPECT_DEMOCRATS know how to pay bills . 
7931	1795	ASPECT_GWB on hand decided that ASPECT_GWB should give rich huge tax cuts . 
7932	1795	And thus revenue plummeted and lost hundreds of billions of dollars . 
7933	1795	graph proves sudden drop in revenue is what caused spike in deficit . 
7934	1796	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.rawstory.com \ \/ rs\/2010\/06 \ \/ p...-clears-acorn \ \/ name one ASPECT_VAN_JONES did wrong . 
7935	1798	to take what fox says to heart is fallacy , as with msnbc `` rdfgd -LRB- joke -RRB- and ASPECT_NEWS_NETWORK . 
7936	1798	They usually only show news from one side of story , where truth is usually somewhere in middle of both sides . 
7937	1798	RDFGD would never want to `` learn anything from Foxnews and or MSNBC prime time anchors as both seem to try to be entertainment than reporting whole story . 
7938	1798	Rather than giving into foxnews fear and or anti-fear bs get opinions from both sides . 
7939	1798	Look to see what seems rational answer and follow . 
7940	1798	one sided story is half done after allwow i mean truth is usually in between story both groups are portraying . 
7941	1799	No communist is n't . 
7942	1799	cite one source where COMMUNIST says COMMUNIST communist . 
7943	1799	COMMUNIST has based ASPECT_COMMUNIST adult career on eco capitalism . 
7944	1799	Not communism . 
7945	1799	COMMUNIST has never supported communism throughout ASPECT_COMMUNIST career . 
7946	1799	Redistribution of wealth is in lot of ideologies from left to right and moderates in between . 
7947	1799	Republicans just do n't like to admit REDISTRIBUTION . 
7948	1800	Your head in sand , no matter how deep , does not change reality . 
7949	1800	I watched and listened to ASPECT_JONES say COMMUNIST is Communist . 
7950	1800	Sorry you missed head , I did not . 
7951	1800	And just for head current date . 
7952	1800	ASPECT_ACORN scionsTuesday , October 12 , 2010 congress must ensure that successor organizations do n't circumvent scionstuesday ban on federal funding of defunct national acorn and ban affiliates . 
7953	1800	defunding happened after video of ASPECT_ASSOCIATION ASPECT_OF ASPECT_COMMUNITY organizations for ASPECT_REFORM ASPECT_NOW workers helpfully advising purported pimp and prostitute made continuance of ASPECT_OBAMA_DEMOCRAT ' longtime acorn love affair politically untenable . 
7954	1800	Now , ASPECT_CONGRESS must ensure old flame is n't rekindled . 
7955	1800	new government accountability office report nonsensically concludes that funding ban does n't apply to Affordable housing centers of ASPECT_AMERICA -LRB- AHCOA -RRB- , formerly acorn housing corp. , which occupies ASPECT_ACORN former philadelphia offices . 
7956	1800	, despite ASPECT_GAO previously saying acorn housing received about 1 million taxpayer dollars -- and Housing and urban development inspector general urging `` inactive status for ASPECT_AHCOA until questions about status handling of previous federal grants are settled . 
7957	1800	ASPECT_U.S. rep. ASPECT_DARRELL ASPECT_ISSA , ASPECT_R-CALIF . 
7957	1800	, wants ASPECT_CONGRESS to `` legislatively clarify that ASPECT_AHCOA should not receive federal funding . 
7958	1800	`` ACORN ASPECT_WASHINGTON sweethearts must think taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- have awfully short memories . 
7959	1800	Hopefully , enough remember acorn scandals to deny federal funding to ASPECT_ACORN renamed affiliates . 
7960	1801	lol dan , you really have little room to talk about liberals being bothered by truth , considering your tendency to completely ignore anything does n't support your position . 
7961	1801	YOU opinion is that ASPECT_FOX is n't really news network , OPINION political opinion and commentary network . 
7962	1801	Which is , of course , perfectly fine , but OPINION really better not to mix two up . 
7963	1801	You should \* never get your information from just one source , no matter how trusted . 
7964	1801	Even best of us make mistakes from time to time . 
7965	1801	YOU think best strategy is to use several centrists sources . 
7966	1801	sources on both extremes seem to have little compunction about distorting information , or even out right lying . 
7967	1801	As for mr beck ... YOU 've listened to beck radio show once . 
7968	1801	-LRB- does also mean YOU 'm not really in good position to make assessment of beck overall . -RRB- 
7969	1801	And in program , YOU heard BECK make one statement in particular ... well , YOU do n't know if LIE was deliberate lie or just blazing stupidity . 
7970	1801	ASPECT_BECK was complaining about ASPECT_AMERICAN history textbook beck had recently come across . 
7971	1801	ASPECT_BECK made several points about book , and seemed well founded to YOU , but ASPECT_BECK then went on to site passage in book which said about ASPECT_US ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHER `` furthering ideals of democracy . 
7972	1801	ASPECT_BECK denounced use of word `` furthering with incredulity repeatedly , leaving impression that ASPECT_US invented democracy . 
7973	1801	YOU do n't know what ASPECT_MR ASPECT_BECK 's thinking behind statement was , but STATEMENT was certainly bizarre , and left extremely poor impression with YOU . 
7974	1804	Ca n't be serious ... 
7975	1805	ASPECT_OBAMA is good man who policies are saving ASPECT_AMERICA . 
7976	1805	What 's not to love ... ? 
7977	1806	Once again you present your opinions as factual and berate me for stating ASPECT_ME_OPINION . 
7978	1806	IF you were fully aware of me posts in re : ASPECT_MEDIUM_SOURCE , you would know that ME have never heard even second of ASPECT_BECK radio show and have never watched beck tv show from start to finish . 
7979	1806	You would also know that ME read liberal papers and watch liberal `` news sources , including keith and chris . 
7980	1806	are so radical make ASPECT_BECK seem like shy lamb . 
7981	1806	ME listen to both sides , research what side has to say , double check research sources for agendas , and weigh SIDE against me 7 decades of experience in life and starting and running multi-million dollar businesses . 
7982	1806	What me have stated is that ASPECT_FOX IS right leaning but is fair network on air . 
7983	1806	than ASPECT_NEWS_SOURCE present both sides of issue . 
7984	1806	REGULARLY have on very far left liberals to present liberal view . 
7985	1806	And do not demonize liberal view , nor marginalize VIEW as liberals constantly do to conservative views . 
7986	1806	ASPECT_FOX does not have , nor does view care to have words to use against liberals like `` teabaggers . 
7987	1806	`` ME present here my opinions , not ASPECT_FOX opinions . 
7988	1806	And ME 'll stack me opinions up against yours using neutral sources at time . 
7989	1806	Here is is fact . 
7990	1806	ASPECT_FOX is outselling one of liberal slanted news sources . 
7991	1806	ASPECT_FOX is making money while ASPECT_NBC ASPECT_ET ASPECT_AL. is loosing viewers and NYTimes and others are looking at bankruptcy . 
7992	1806	liberals and democrats attribute that to public being stupid . 
7993	1806	Well ASPECT_ME_OPINION is that public is actually very smart and public has seen through liberal nonsense . 
7994	1806	upcoming elections are proof . 
7995	1806	ASPECT_REPUBLICAN and ` teabagger ' challengers are running on issues of too big govt and too spending . 
7996	1806	While Democrats are begging free ride parasites to get out and vote for Dems or lose CHALLENGERS free ride on people actually have ambitions and goals , . 
7997	1807	You know there are sources of information are neither liberal or conservative . 
7998	1807	But in general I 've seen you label sources as liberally biased simply because they go against your world view and ideology . 
7999	1809	I do not accept nor use biased sources . 
8000	1809	Since I do not use conservative sources against liberals , I do not accept liberal sources against conservatives . 
8001	1809	Your opinion of unbiased source is one is not radically far left . 
8002	1809	I opinion is one is as neutral as possible in either direction . 
8003	1809	When I cite source like ASPECT_BUREAU ASPECT_OF ASPECT_LABOR_STATISTIC and get rebuttal from liberal using source like ASPECT_MOVEON.ORG . 
8004	1809	I laugh at tragicomic stupidity of liberal . 
8005	1809	Both for attempting to use source and for believing words on site . 
8006	1810	What policies are SAVING ASPECT_AMERICA ? 
8007	1810	ASPECT_AMERICA is built on freedom and capitalism . 
8008	1810	He is ASPECT_CHANGING ASPECT_AMERICA . 
8009	1810	Turning ASPECT_AMERICA into socialist country is hardly saving ASPECT_AMERICA ... AMERICA destroying ASPECT_AMERICA . 
8010	1811	You know , ASPECT_DAN , constant harping on fact and opinion is really starting to irritate me . 
8011	1811	You seem to think that you can label me positions as opinions , that opinions are equally valid , and that therefore your position can not be refuted . 
8012	1811	's load of BS , and frankly , ME 'm insulted that you 'd try to hide behind transparent rationalization . 
8013	1811	In world , line between opinion and fact is not as absolute as you like to imply . 
8014	1811	There is always \* uncertainty in information , and ultimately anything can be characterized as opinion . 
8015	1811	law of gravity is opinion , since you have to take as accurate information supporting law . 
8016	1811	with germ theory of disease . 
8017	1811	Or idea that ASPECT_EARTH is giant sphere floating in space . 
8018	1811	OPINION opinion that you can see upper portions of approaching ship at sea because of curvature of earth . 
8019	1811	OPINION opinion that photographs of ASPECT_EARTH from space are n't faked . 
8020	1811	OPINION opinion that ASPECT_GPS uses satellites , and not mechanism 's kept secret to conceal that ASPECT_EARTH is actually flat . 
8021	1811	So unless you want to join tinfoil beanie crowd , quit trying to pretend that opinions are equal . 
8022	1811	They are n't , and CROWD inane , insulting , and just plain childish to keep saying THEY are . 
8023	1811	And frankly , if way you can challenge me positions is by trying to use underhanded yet pathetically transparent rhetorical trick , you 're as as admitting that ME 'm right . 
8024	1812	Just to pick one insanely dumb out of health insurance bill . 
8025	1812	Deficit neutral ?????????? 
8026	1812	Since passage ASPECT_CBO has revised costs UPWARD times already and we are at barest beginning . 
8027	1812	ASPECT_CBO will cost , according to ASPECT_CBO just about trillion dollars . 
8028	1812	will be paid for in mandated coverage -LRB- being challenged in 20 lawsuits now with to come -RRB- , increased taxes , and by taking 500,000,000,000.00 out of ASPECT_MEDICARE . 
8029	1812	So HALF funding of obamacare is to come from insurance coverage covers people will need FUNDING . 
8030	1812	Where is logic in ? 
8031	1812	Plus we are talking about over 50 million seniors , and seniors vote . 
8032	1812	obamacare does not specify where and how HALF trillion dollars will be taken from ASPECT_MEDICARE , But I 'm willing to bet that no politician seeking another term EVER is going to vote to take away ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE from 50 + million seniors that vote . 
8033	1812	I predict here and now that obamacare , if allowed to proceed , will incur 10 year cost well in excess of 5,000,000,000,000.00 5 Trillion dollars . 
8034	1812	And I further predict not not only will half trillion dollars not come from ASPECT_MEDICARE , but medicare funding will increase .50 + million voters will not be angered . 
8035	1812	is one aspect of obamacare . 
8036	1812	Another is increased coverage without underwriting is not possible without premium increases and liberal politicians are well aware of FACT , not opinion . 
8037	1812	POLITICIANS are planning to do `` correction sometime in future will screw country royally , or POLITICIANS are more stupid than we can believe . 
8038	1812	HOW is HOW that ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY have been regulated by politicians for of your life and before , yet COMPANIES are screwing public . 
8039	1812	And how is ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY being regulated under obamacare going to be different . 
8040	1812	Before ASPECT_OBAMACAREINSURANCE_COMPANY could NOTCancel in force policy except for non payment of premiums . 
8041	1812	Cancel policy because got sick . 
8042	1812	Raise individual premium for reason , sickness , age , whatever . 
8043	1812	regulations existed before obamacare and were `` enforced by elected or appointed politicians . 
8044	1812	ASPECT_OBAMACARE_CHANGE in area . 
8045	1812	And before you argue with I , look AREA up on state govt websites under insurance commissioners or insurance regulators . 
8046	1813	How about preventing second Great depression ? 
8047	1813	does n't qualify as saving ASPECT_US ? 
8048	1813	And socialism does not exclude freedom or democracy . 
8049	1813	Actually , I 'm curious , why exactly are we arguing about labels from nineteenth century ideological debate ? 
8050	1813	Surely WE 've learned about how to run economy and society in general in two centuries . 
8051	1813	as neither pure laissez-faire capitalist system nor strict command economy work terribly well in world . 
8052	1814	We are in depression , well I think everyone can at least agree that WE are in recession . 
8053	1814	What did he do to save DEPRESSION ? 
8054	1814	DEPRESSION was n't like HE waved wand of anything . 
8055	1815	Who says we are in depression ? 
8058	1816	Great depression in ASPECT_US saw 25 unemployment , thousands of ASPECT_BANK_FAILURE , and numbers of ASPECT_AMERICANS forced to live in shanty towns called Hoovervilles . 
8059	1816	You tell ME , jthorpe , does sound like what 's going on today ? 
8060	1816	economy right now is stagnant , not in recession . 
8061	1816	ECONOMY 's bad , but at least not getting worse . 
8062	1816	And certainly lot better then LOT was two years ago . 
8063	1816	And no , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA did n't wave wand - ASPECT_OBAMA got stimulus passed . 
8064	1816	And as we 've already examined in detail in thread , stimulus did \* help economy , and things would \* have been worse without DETAIL . 
8065	1816	-LRB- Yes , ASPECT_DAN , WE know you completely disagree with , no need to repeat yourself . -RRB- 
8066	1817	Sorry but I will not let you get away with stating opinion as fact . 
8067	1817	Your opinion and obummer opinion and obummer harvard economists opinions are that 700,000 jobs , or 2 million jobs or 3.5 million jobs have been `` SAVED -LRB- absolute bullsh ! 
8068	1817	term -RRB- or created since Stimulus . 
8069	1817	None of numbers are provable . 
8070	1817	When tried , even liberal media stated that ECONOMISTS were vastly overstated . 
8071	1817	But whatever you wish to opine , fine . 
8072	1817	There is also group of economists that believe 2 million jobs have been LOST since Stimulus was passed . 
8073	1817	Your opinion would disagree with economists opinion . 
8074	1817	I actually do not have opinion on which side is correct or most accurate . 
8075	1817	What I see with I own eyes is businesses closed up . 
8076	1817	chain restaurants with multi-promotions and lower prices . 
8077	1817	housing developments without single occupied home . 
8078	1817	Reports of housing starts and sales still in dumper with lowest interest rates of I long , lifetime . 
8079	1817	And there is not light at end of tunnel in sight yet . 
8080	1817	I will say . 
8081	1817	With talk about foreclosure paperwork problems , ASPECT_OBAMA said he does not support moratorium on foreclosures . 
8082	1817	is single wise economic statement HE has made since taking office . 
8083	1818	Actually its bipartisan congressional Budget office estimate . 
8084	1818	Not ASPECT_OBAMA or ASPECT_OBAMA_TEAM . 
8085	1819	You do n't have opinion ? 
8087	1819	You could n't have made your opinion clearer if you 'd rented billboard in Times square . 
8088	1819	At least have decency and courage to stand by your position . 
8089	1819	So tell me , who exactly are economists ? 
8090	1819	Let see names , quotes . 
8091	1819	If ME 're going to cite , actually cite . 
8092	1819	Yes , it 's opinion that Stimulus helped economy . 
8093	1819	And ME and others here have provided ample evidence to support IT . 
8094	1819	You 've even inadvertently provided supporting evidence yourself . 
8095	1819	And despite being challenged times , you have yet to provide single shred of evidence to contrary . 
8096	1819	ME really fail to see how conclusion can be reasonably reached or supported . 
8097	1819	Yeees , ASPECT_DAN , as everyone agrees , economy sucks . 
8098	1819	No one says different , situation is bad . 
8099	1819	But ONE could be heck of lot worse . 
8100	1819	We 're nowhere near levels of misery seen in ASPECT_GREAT depression . 
8101	1819	stimulus has helped . 
8102	1819	How bad would things be now if ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA had done , just sat back and watched ? 
8103	1819	No one knows for certain , but ME , for one , am glad we did n't have to find out hard way . 
8104	1819	--------- On lighter note ... ME 'm working on getting back to you about ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM , but REFORM kind of annoying having to track down insurance regulations of state . 
8105	1819	-LRB- mutters -RRB- 50 different sets of regulations for one country , is why states rights people are mad . 
8106	1819	-LRB- j\/k -RRB- LOL 50 is kind of pain , tho . 
8107	1819	But ME will get back to you on J\/K . 
8108	1820	As ALWAYS you tell me what ME meant ! 
8109	1820	Get over yourself . 
8110	1820	ME said ME do n't have opinion on who is right on creating or losing jobs , because ME do not have opinion on who is right . 
8111	1820	ME 'm sure that jobs created are not as numerous as admin and numerous cronies claim , and ME 'm sure that jobs lost figure is at least somewhat inflated by admin ASPECT_POLITICAL_OPPONENT . 
8112	1820	ME have opinion that Stimulus was unnecessary and has extended recovery by 2 years or . 
8113	1820	And opinion me have about pro or con politicians , and jobs losses or gains , is that neither is overly concerned with truth . 
8114	1820	And whom did you quote other than administration cronies ? 
8115	1820	Do you want ME to quote ultra conservatives . 
8116	1820	Or are you claiming that there are no ultra conservatives saying Stimulus lost jobs ? 
8117	1820	Why name names when ME do not put faith in accuracy of either side ? 
8118	1820	And you already know , or should , that there are opponents with contrary opinions . 
8119	1820	You inability to see anything does not in way change conjecture into fact . 
8120	1820	But ASPECT_US do LOVE to state your opinions as facts . 
8121	1820	--------- Yes , INABILITY could be worse and yes yes could be better . 
8122	1820	History may tell us which , since currents events only show what is happening with massive govt intervention . 
8123	1820	And massive govt intervention IS what caused recession in place . 
8124	1820	Relying on idiots -LRB- politicians , not just liberals -RRB- to fix problems THEY caused is about as far from wisdom as we can get . 
8125	1820	Just as ASPECT_WALL_STREET and ASPECT_BANKING_INDUSTRY were HEAVILY REGULATED by politicians LONG BEFORE financial `` crisis . 
8126	1820	So was ASPECT_INSURANCE_INDUSTRY even MORE heavily regulated long before , decades , before obamacare . 
8127	1820	ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY were heavily regulated long before ASPECT_OBAMA was even born . 
8128	1820	moments of clear thinking ought to make you say , `` Of course ! 
8129	1820	`` How could COMPANIES NOT have been regulated years . 
8130	1820	Besides simple logic , YEARS is also FACT . 
8131	1820	year , TRILLIONS of dollars pass through both ASPECT_WALL_STREET and ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY . 
8132	1820	Do you think politician , liberal , conservative , Democrat , ASPECT_REPUBLICAN , independent , whig , or group would ever ignore industry handling TRILLIONS of dollars ? 
8133	1820	EVEN for DAY ? 
8134	1820	Let alone hundred years ? 
8135	1821	Yeah , because ASPECT_OBAMA is really helping Seniors . 
8136	1822	At least you can count on him not privatizing social security . 
8137	1823	But you can count on him raising prices for ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE . 
8138	1824	Surely ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSURER would never do . 
8139	1825	word ... private . 
8140	1825	Not government . 
8141	1825	WORD 's what they have to when bunch of people who ca n't pay for healthcare , get BUNCH paid for by others . 
8142	1825	Redistribution of wealth at WORD finest . 
8143	1825	Undeserving people riding system on of others . 
8144	1826	Not necessarily . 
8145	1826	There are 20 states repealling ASPECT_OBAMA care and case is going to be heard . 
8146	1826	Take look at : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.silobreaker.com \ \/ judge-dec ... 81518310637623 
8147	1827	I sure hope happens . 
8148	1827	Especially since I live in ASPECT_MICHIGAN . 
8149	1827	I remember hearing soon after originally passed , but since I have n't really heard anything of . 
8150	1828	Sorry , I did not realize I post was botched up . 
8151	1828	POST one of links where you keep clicking on them and I just fixed I post . 
8152	1828	I heard POST on news night from one of attorneys are on case . 
8153	1828	He had good points on why HE thinks could go to Supreme court . 
8154	1828	I think people are concerned about medicare cuts and Cap & tax part of bill . 
8155	1828	I am not altogether sure . 
8156	1829	So it 's perfectly okay if numbers of people are given shaft so long as SHAFT done by ASPECT_PRIVATE_COMPANY ? 
8157	1829	If people are driven into bankruptcy , denied ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE , 's fine so long as getting rich off of CARE ? 
8159	1829	given choice between having my ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE administered by ASPECT_PRIVATE_COMPANY 's unaccountable to and has profit motive to sit back and watch MY suffer and die , and having CARE administered by ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AGENCY 's ultimately accountable to voters , MY 'll take government . 
8160	1829	And how exactly do you decide who undeserving ? 
8161	1829	If is poor voters must obviously be way because VOTERS 're lazy or stupid or just generally bad person , is that CHOICE ? 
8162	1829	You should be careful about saying people deserve whatever people can squeeze out of system . 
8163	1829	law of jungle means no holds barred , period . 
8164	1829	part of government job is to level ASPECT_PLAYING_FIELD and ensure that everyone plays by rules . 
8165	1829	Even hammurabi said four millennia ago ASPECT_HAMMURABI was given ASPECT_HAMMURABI throne `` so that strong should not harm weak . 
8166	1829	And we benefit by living in society where government actually does half decent job of GOVERNMENT . 
8167	1829	Taxes are price of living in civilized society . 
8168	1829	MY find price interesting that of people who complain about people getting government benefits having sense of entitlement seem to feel entitled to benefits of civilized society without having to pay for SOCIETY . 
8169	1830	It 's boils down to what is constitutional in bill . 
8170	1830	ASPECT_PRIVATE_INSURER will have say in what tests and procedures are approved in regards to your ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE . 
8171	1830	There is panel who will make decisions regarding your care in democratic bill that ASPECT_CONGRESS passed . 
8172	1830	Now concerning cost and I am no economic major . 
8173	1830	I do see where is absolutely ludicrous . 
8174	1831	Rich people should n't be entitled to pay for anyones health care is problem . 
8175	1831	ASPECT_HEALTHCARE is service not right . 
8176	1831	You do n't have right to money . 
8177	1831	You do n't have right to service . 
8178	1831	HEALTHCARE just anomaly to think you are entitled to healthcare from doctor . 
8179	1831	So if I want I lawn cared for ... I should be entitled to else 's service ? 
8180	1831	Even if I ca n't afford LAWN ? 
8181	1831	rich should pay for ASPECT_LAWN ? 
8182	1832	I just ca n't get over how people think we are going to insure millions of new americans and LACK is going to lower ASPECT_OVERALL_COST of healthcare . 
8183	1832	LACK just lack of logic . 
8184	1832	more than bunch of sheep listening to people messiah . 
8185	1833	Yes , and I failed to mention in I post that Dems think POST will actually reduce deficit by 131 billion over 10 years . 
8186	1833	We need to do math here . 
8187	1833	Have they mentioned amount of tax revenue they plan to come up with ? 
8188	1833	Not that I have heard . 
8190	1834	4 TO 6 billion in ASPECT_NEW_TAX per year , plus ASPECT_INSURANCE_PREMIUM from EVERYBODY , or penalty for not buying , AND BEST OF 500 BILLION dollars WILL BE taken from medicare . 
8191	1834	IF is done , ASPECT_CBO originally said obamacare would be deficit neutral over 10 years . 
8192	1834	But ASPECT_CBO has already revised cost estimate upward couple of times and program has n't even started . 
8193	1834	So politicians seeking re-election year will have to publicly VOTE on higher taxes year , and taxes will have to be higher than estimates . 
8194	1834	So tax funding is unlikely . 
8195	1834	premiums or penalty funding is already being challenged in 20 different court tests and WILL end up in SCOTUS . 
8196	1834	And , which re-election seeking politician from party will take dime from 50 + million VOTING seniors on ASPECT_MEDICARE . 
8197	1834	ai n't gonna happen . 
8198	1834	So as usual govt program WILL cost 5 or times more than estimated , -LRB- PROGRAM happens time , and opposite never happens -RRB- and tax funding WILL fall WAY short . 
8199	1834	premium or penalty part will be found unconstitutional , so ZERO funding from nonsense . 
8200	1834	And medicare dollars will never exist . 
8201	1834	If not repealed in 2013 , when ASPECT_OBAMA is sent back to re-organize ASPECT_ACORN in ASPECT_CHICAGO , `` health insurance expansion bill will cost in excess of 5 trillion unfunded dollars . 
8202	1835	Sadly , jthorp , social contract involves both rights and responsibilities . 
8203	1835	Like contract or not , we are part of one community , and have responsibility to make community work . 
8204	1835	And ignoring needs of segment of population is one of best ways I can think of to tear community apart . 
8205	1835	WE benefit from living in prosperous , peaceful society . 
8206	1835	Tell I , just how rich would rich be if WE could n't count on lights coming on when WE flip switch , clean water coming out of tap , trash being whisked away , police and courts to protect WE , and so on and so on ? 
8207	1835	awful lot of prosperity is due to productive and technological capital that WE 've been building up for generations . 
8208	1835	How can of WE claim special right to legacy of we ancestors ? 
8209	1835	WE rely on RIGHT , whether WE realize RIGHT or not . 
8210	1835	If you really want to just sit back and watch while people suffer and die , you 're both immoral and fool . 
8211	1835	If on bottom of socio-economic ladder are kept impoverished with precious little chance of advancement , what incentive do have to buy into society ? 
8212	1835	And if numbers of people stop buying into society , BOTTOM just going to fall apart . 
8213	1835	BOTTOM just plain flat out in best interest of wealthy to look after lower classes , as well as being decent and moral to do . 
8214	1835	We live in extraordinarily wealthy society , and WE have both ability and responsibility to care for everyone . 
8215	1835	And before I hear usual platitudes about hard work and ASPECT_PERSONAL_RESPONSIBILITY ... ASPECT_PERSONAL_RESPONSIBILITY is very important . 
8216	1835	So is collective responsibility . 
8217	1835	we ignore either at we peril . 
8218	1835	And as admirable and necessary as hard work is , saying that of society ills would be solved if everyone would work hard enough is naive . 
8219	1835	If PERIL takes is hard work to reach pinnacle of society , why is poor ? 
8220	1835	fact is that not that people manage to move really dramatically on socio-economic scale . 
8222	1836	I will be for ASPECT_CHAMBER ASPECT_OF ASPECT_COMMERCE , who promotes small business and hiring ! 
8224	1838	At what point is your wholly imaginary `` social responsibility met ? 
8225	1838	Today top 25 of wealth pays 86.6 of ASPECT_INCOME_TAX and 27 pays remaining 13.4 of ASPECT_INCOME_TAX . 
8226	1838	Leaving 47 of nation TAKES out , rather than paying IN anything . 
8227	1838	have fiscal responsibility to fund operations of Govt . 
8228	1838	do not have social responsibility to support will not support themselves . 
8229	1838	CHARITY is there for , Charity is means for wish to exercise imagined `` social responsibility . 
8230	1838	And charity is encouraged through tax deductiblity . 
8231	1838	If you want charity , work for charitable tax deductions . 
8232	1838	What came first , chicken or egg ? 
8233	1838	of what you cite above is ASPECT_DIRECT_RESULT of PERSON deciding to INVEST , at great personal risk to , time , ideas , brainpower , future , and money . 
8234	1838	Part of decision might have been genius , or simple desire to improve , but part was also for personal gain . 
8235	1838	`` poor benefit from accomplishments in technology and productivity . 
8236	1838	Is BENEFIT too much to ask that investor made BENEFIT possible , enjoy lion share of accomplishments without being vilified ? 
8237	1838	`` Suffer and die ????????? 
8238	1838	is next to non-existent in ASPECT_USA . 
8239	1838	`` poor are families of 4 making 22,000.00 per year or less and `` rich are making 200,000.00 or per year . 
8240	1838	Both political arbitrary numbers . 
8241	1838	Based solely on vote buying , not reality . 
8242	1838	BOTH `` poor have homes , cars , multiple tv , cell phones , designer clothes , overnourished bodies , and free education available . 
8243	1838	While 80 of BOTH `` rich , make under 500,000.00 and are primary source of small business job creation . 
8244	1838	You want to give to who already have than BOTH have earned by taking away from who make source possible for `` poor to have than BOTH have earned . 
8245	1838	Hard work and ASPECT_PERSONAL_RESPONSIBILITY are not `` platitudes . 
8246	1838	are essentials to free democratic republic functioning or not . 
8247	1838	`` COLLECTIVE is favorite Communist word . 
8248	1838	There is no collective responsibility . 
8249	1838	`` COMMUNIST brothers keeper is religious tenant , not governmental one . 
8250	1838	Hard work is not ONE takes to be successful . 
8251	1838	ONE takes brains , and determination , and ambition . 
8252	1838	And idea and goal . 
8253	1838	poor have little of of AND for part , DO ASPECT_NOT_WORK hard . 
8254	1838	When starting out in business , I worked harder , longer , and hopefully smarter than employee I had . 
8255	1838	And less money , and sometimes NO money , went in I pocket , while employees did get paid . 
8256	1838	All while not KNOWING , but taking chance , that what I was doing WOULD be successful . 
8257	1838	Now retired , over course of I working life I 've provided jobs , GOOD jobs , for over 1000 people . 
8258	1838	But never for minute did I hesitate to fire trying to ` coast ' through job . 
8259	1838	country became successful because we have had equal opportunity to try to become successful . 
8260	1838	in we history , until liberalism , ever said everyone has equal right to share in others success . 
8261	1841	basic health and safety is right we provide in various ways in country , including police and fire departments ! 
8262	1841	Why is RIGHT suddenly wrong to provide health and safety in medicine , like developed nation does . 
8263	1841	People are dying and forcing people family into bankruptcy over medical bills and you 're complaining about taxes ? 
8264	1841	I do n't see how arguing your position can call PEOPLE patriot . 
8265	1841	No one should be allowed to profit off of denying people health and safety . 
8266	1841	's as simple as ONE gets . 
8267	1841	food companies do n't get away with ONE . 
8268	1841	drug companies do n't get away with ONE . 
8269	1841	And ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY should n't get away with ONE either . 
8270	1841	Maybe you should care less about profits of ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY and more about health and well being of your fellow americans . 
8271	1842	Your arguments stand on philosophy of Bleeding heart liberalism , . 
8272	1842	You firmly believe in liberal philosophy , Good fer you . 
8273	1842	However , as I 've said times before , your belief , your opinion , your philosophy . 
8274	1842	DOES not constitute FACT . 
8275	1842	There are philosophies , beliefs , and opinions . 
8276	1842	Just as righteous , just as provable , as yours . 
8277	1842	You `` CLAIM anarchy and chaos without your liberalism . 
8278	1842	is plain and simple bullsh ! 
8279	1842	and is fact , not opinion . 
8281	1842	As I stated , CHARITY could solve problem liberalism purports to solve . 
8282	1842	WITHOUT enlarging Govt to point -LRB- PAST -RRB- where we can not afford we state or federal govts . 
8283	1842	GOVT should be obvious to clear thinker that Government is not answer to anything . 
8284	1842	Government is necessary drain on ASPECT_WE_LIFE and ASPECT_WE_ECONOMY and DRAIN must at times be tightly controlled and minimized . 
8285	1842	WE have NOT been doing that , Democrats or republicans , and look at financial horror we are in . 
8286	1842	How is that helping poor ? 
8287	1842	And HORROR IS Govt fault that poor are suffering . 
8288	1842	liberals claim to be seeking answers from Govt , but in reality you 're trying to make yourself feel good using ASPECT_PEOPLE_MONEY . 
8289	1842	And present day looked at with 20\/20 vision should show DAY does not and can not work . 
8290	1842	And has came before give I advantage and head start ? 
8291	1842	Yes , ABSOLUTELY advantage did . 
8292	1842	ADVANTAGE LAZY WORTHLESS PARASITE got AS WELL . 
8293	1842	I just made of advantage instead of whining and looking for handouts . 
8294	1842	And how about answer to question . 
8295	1842	How is ENOUGH ? 
8296	1842	With so called 25 &#37; rich now paying 86.6 of ASPECT_INCOME_TAX and your ` poor ' and remaining 47 of public paying . 
8297	1842	Should rich pay 99.999 ? 
8298	1842	And if you think that , I can tell you that liberals would want . 
8299	1843	I 'm sorry , I thought it was obvious that we 're discussing philosophy at point . 
8300	1843	And I \*\* never \*\* claimed to be righteous . 
8301	1843	I am not , never have been , and never will be righteous . 
8302	1843	I have no special insight , no divine inspiration , no special connection to absolute truth . 
8303	1843	And I most certainly do not have answers . 
8304	1843	I 'm just one fallible person doing I best to figure things out and maybe contribute little to making community bit better . 
8305	1843	If I 'm wrong , then show I . 
8306	1843	Show I where I 'm wrong , give I convincing argument , or show I evidence , and I 'll change I mind if MIND measures up . 
8307	1843	But do n't expect I to take you seriously if you have is `` cause YOU say so . 
8308	1843	`` Chaos and anarchy are very possibilities when people at top of socio-economic ladder neglect farther down . 
8309	1843	History is full of examples of revolts and revolutions when people are pushed too far . 
8310	1843	And even examples of great civilizations falling into darkness when people leadership neglects big picture . 
8311	1843	From intermediate period of Ancient egypt to ASPECT_RUSSIAN revolution of 1917 , chaos and anarchy is specter that society has always lived with . 
8312	1843	And if let things fall apart , PERIOD can \* happen here . 
8313	1843	ASPECT_US is subject to forces as nation in world history . 
8314	1843	If wish to avoid fate of so of predecessors , need to learn from examples , both what did right and what did wrong . 
8315	1843	As crucial as FATE is to safeguard rights of individual , need to keep eye on big picture , too . 
8316	1843	Neither can be neglected if want grand experiment call ASPECT_UNITED_STATE to succeed in term . 
8317	1843	Tell I , why do you think government assistance programs were instituted in place ? 
8318	1843	Because private charities simply were n't getting job done . 
8319	1843	Government is not inherently evil , then social institution . 
8320	1843	JOB is simply tool , and whether JOB does good or ill depends entirely on how JOB used . 
8321	1843	Do YOU honestly believe that poverty -LRB- as relative term as is -RRB- exists solely because who are n't rich are `` lazy worthless parasites ? 
8322	1843	You see poverty as only being personal moral failing ? 
8323	1843	Then why in world is poverty still social issue ? 
8324	1843	Do you think WORLD fun being poor ? 
8325	1843	Do you think that living on government benefits gives you luxurious lifestyle ? 
8326	1843	Then you need serious reality check , I friend . 
8327	1843	I assure you that none of is even remotely true . 
8328	1843	And generally speaking , poor definitely do not use benefits to buy designer clothes . 
8329	1843	Paying basic bills is enough of challenge , I promise you . 
8330	1843	How is enough ? 
8331	1843	There is never firm answer to . 
8332	1843	ANSWER that we as community must decide through political process , through consensus and compromise , through actually listening to . 
8333	1843	What we need are practical , pragmatic people from over political spectrum to talk , to give we people points of view , to make suggestions , to be as forceful advocate for people positions as possible . 
8334	1843	we need to take best that of WE has to offer , even parts that you do n't agree with . 
8335	1843	But WE need serious ideas , not , `` do n't want to pay taxes , not , `` But why should have to so something about SPECTRUM ? 
8336	1843	not , `` Hey , man , JOB not job . 
8337	1844	revolts in past have been against `` power being used to stop individualism and freedom . 
8338	1844	Pretty much what liberalism is trying to do now . 
8339	1844	There have been NO revolts in history against free market . 
8340	1844	Right now LIBERALS in ASPECT_EUROPE are revolting , striking , and looting and destroying , and even KILLING because fiscal mess can not be supported longer and liberals are losing ASPECT_TINY_BIT of liberals freebies . 
8341	1844	And for LIBERALS are willing to kill . 
8342	1844	is LIBERALS willing to kill to keep liberals unsustainable giveaway programs . 
8343	1844	You can not SEE danger there ????? 
8344	1844	Conservatives are trying to say and have said for years , `` Let years not follow ASPECT_EUROPE , let ASPECT_EUROPE follow CONSERVATIVES . 
8345	1844	But liberals insisted that we follow ASPECT_EUROPE . 
8346	1844	Can you not see where ends . 
8347	1844	Bankrupt countries , fiscally AND morally bankrupt under guise of doing good and being ` compassionate . 
8348	1844	You ask for proof , you ask I make good argument against liberalism , Simple , ASPECT_EUROPE ! 
8349	1844	ASPECT_EUROPE should be little kid tagging along behind and trying to get big kids to play with KIDS . 
8350	1844	Instead , if we do not change we ways , ASPECT_EUROPE is showing we we bleak future . 
8351	1844	ENABLING people to BE poor is what liberalism does . 
8352	1844	ASPECT_EUROPE does to ennoble people ASPECT_EUROPE only enables PEOPLE . 
8353	1844	Liberals say that placing demands on poor is demeaning POOR . 
8354	1844	is opposite of truth . 
8355	1844	MAKE liberals earn everything , and LIBERALS will find ambition , pride , self esteem , and drive . 
8356	1844	And ASPECT_PERSONAL_RESPONSIBILITY . 
8357	1844	If we can afford to give to poor , we can afford to make work for POOR to do instead . 
8358	1844	And your claim that charity was not doing job is completely fallacious . 
8359	1844	No giveaway programs were started to make up charitable shortfall . 
8360	1844	giveaway programs have one purpose and one purpose only . 
8361	1844	And is not to help poor , purpose is to help politician buy votes . 
8362	1844	And NO conservative is saying , `` NO do n't want to pay taxes . 
8363	1844	We are saying , `` POOR refuse to pay even taxes until Govt stops wasting 50 cents of tax dollar poor pay now . 
8364	1845	Why on earth would we pay for permanent jobs for poor ?! 
8365	1845	Assistance is only supposed to be temporary . 
8366	1845	providing jobs just for sake of providing jobs has potential to be lifelong commitment ! 
8367	1845	SAKE would cost money for about amount of benefit ! 
8368	1845	jobs government should be creating for sake of improving economy is ASPECT_TEMPORARY_JOB . 
8369	1845	And they should only be creating in times of economic slowdown . 
8370	1845	We do n't want to set WE up for bunch of life commitments unless BUNCH going to seriously improve ASPECT_WE_ECONOMY . 
8371	1845	temporary assistance is poor people need . 
8372	1845	people on welfare get off bunch within years because PEOPLE are able to find job and support people family . 
8373	1845	Welfare helps poor get back to work . 
8374	1846	`` WELFARE helps POOR get back TO WORK ! 
8375	1846	`` HOW ??? 
8376	1846	There is temporary about giveaway programs we have for poor . 
8377	1846	changes to giveaway programs is POOR get increased . 
8378	1847	FACT fact that average welfare family only stays on welfare for years that . 
8379	1847	welfare life is not life of luxury . 
8380	1847	People want to get off life as soon as possible . 
8381	1847	And welfare does help people get back to work in LIFE keeps demand up in recessions which causes businesses to hire again sooner . 
8382	1847	In end welfare saves us money than end costs because welfare is recession buster . 
8383	1847	Want to end recession quickly and effectively ? 
8384	1847	Increase foodstamps and extend welfare benefits . 
8385	1848	And pass costs on to ASPECT_INFINITY ? 
8386	1848	2 things wrong with your `` plan . 
8387	1848	`` 1 . 
8388	1848	1 does n't work2 . 
8389	1848	YOUR can not afford 1 . 
8390	1848	Govt is no different than you and I. If YOUR keep running out of money before end of year , your know your have to CHANGE what YOUR 've been doing . 
8391	1848	And since , like Govt , YOUR can only marginally increase your revenue , YOUR must stop your outflow . 
8392	1848	is not painless or welcome to individual or Govt . 
8393	1848	Things can not be avoided and MUST be done are seldom relished . 
8394	1848	But still must be done . 
8395	1848	There is NO alternative choice except for things to get worse and worse until collapse ! 
8396	1849	Welfare has already been proven to work . 
8397	1849	Hence why WELFARE been around for 80 years . 
8398	1849	Hence why economic school teaches that extension of welfare benefits is ASPECT_ECONOMIC_STIMULUS . 
8399	1849	Back before republicans went crazy stupid republicans knew fact as well . 
8400	1849	Extention of welfare in bad times used to be bipartisan because everyone who knew anything about economics knows welfare benefits economy like school child knows earth rotates around sun . 
8401	1849	Just because you do n't understand how EXTENTION works does n't mean EXTENTION does n't work . 
8402	1849	We are n't running out of money because welfare costs too much . 
8403	1849	WE 're running out of money because we taxes have been way too low for about 30 years now . 
8404	1849	Since ASPECT_REAGAN cut them . 
8405	1849	Conservatives would rather see more in conservatives paycheck then see country where people do not starve to death or die of curable disease simply because PEOPLE could n't afford food and medicine . 
8406	1849	And CONSERVATIVES think CONSERVATIVES are following ASPECT_JESUS in doing so . 
8407	1849	What joke . 
8408	1850	Welfare did start under liberal president in 1930 . 
8409	1850	WELFARE worked so well that Great depression ended shortly after end of WWII in later 1940 . 
8410	1850	Way to go ! 
8411	1850	Tax , Spend , Tax , Spend , ASPECT_HUP , ASPECT_HOOP , hreep , harr , Tax , Spend , Tax , Spend , ASPECT_HUP , ASPECT_HOOP , hreep , harr , Tax , Spend , Tax , Spend , ASPECT_HUP , ASPECT_HOOP , hreep , harr ,

8413	1851	YOU want YOU lawn cared for . 
8414	1851	Are you going to help pay for LAWN ? 
8415	1851	You know , since you are `` patriot . 
8416	1853	What does lawn care have to do with health and safety ? 
8417	1853	We 're talking about people dieing of curable disease . 
8418	1853	's not at comparable . 
8419	1854	Because I 'm going to get depressed if I lawn does n't look good . 
8420	1854	Nobody dies from preventable disease in ASPECT_AMERICA , nobody is denied healthcare already . 
8421	1855	Here 's fact or 2 . 
8422	1855	LIBERAL are liberal . 
8423	1855	Sadly , around 20 of ASPECT_AMERICANS still are liberals . 
8424	1855	And you just played ASPECT_RACE_CARD against opponent . 
8425	1855	Not because your opponent is racist , but because CARD your kool-aid purveyors have taught you to do . 
8426	1856	Your 2 paras are liberal dreaming of perfect world that will not happen . 
8427	1856	had 50 years to happen in Medicare so far and has not happened ever . 
8428	1856	Politicians from both parties claiming THEY will stop Medicare , -LRB- insurance -RRB- and Medicaid -LRB- welfare -RRB- fraud are old , old news . 
8429	1856	NONE has money to show for politicians promises . 
8430	1856	And 500 billion is silliest claim ever made . 
8431	1856	And EVER wo n't happen 
8432	1857	Bull -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- people do n't die . 
8433	1857	CHOICE hard choice to put your family through tens of thousands in debt or just die quiet death and leave your family debt free . 
8434	1857	lot of ASPECT_AMERICANS choose latter . 
8435	1857	People do die from treatable diseases . 
8436	1857	You are completely out of touch if you believe otherwise . 
8437	1857	LOT 's not as easy as simply going to emergency room . 
8438	1857	LOT paying for lot afterwards 's problem . 
8439	1857	And no body should be forced to put family into debt to survive . 
8440	1857	Civilized societies do not do that to civilians . 
8441	1857	ASPECT_AMERICA is developed nation does . 
8442	1857	And ASPECT_AMERICA because there are too people in country would prefer to see ASPECT_EXTRA_DOLLAR in CIVILIANS paycheck then see country where no one has to choose between death and supporting civilians family . 
8446	1858	It 's not one or . 
8447	1858	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE is expensive , MONEY 's not ASPECT_EXTRA_DOLLAR . 
8448	1858	MONEY lot money , through taxes and insurance . 
8449	1858	MONEY worse healthcare for people paying for healthcare . 
8450	1858	MONEY free healthcare for people who contribute . 
8451	1858	You ca n't provide source for your radical claims money ridiculous . 
8452	1858	reason doctor costs are so high is because of idiots that try to sue hospital time natural happens . 
8453	1858	people -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ing are n't ones paying . 
8454	1858	ASPECT_ING quite typical . 
8455	1858	socialized healthcare is so great ... not . 
8456	1858	What treatable disease poor person typically dies from ? 
8457	1858	There is n't . 
8458	1858	's whole point of insurance , you know to insure yourself from being in position to choose between outrageous prices and not getting healthcare . 
8459	1858	DISEASE 's way for anything else . 
8460	1858	If I do n't buy home insurance and I house burns down ... what happens ? 
8461	1858	Everyone should be entitled to basic health care like they already are , but to suggest that everyone needs to go to doctor for routine cold on taxpayers money is asinine . 
8462	1859	Absolutely wrong . 
8463	1859	If your ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE wo n't cover INSURANCE , and you do n't have money , , diseases will not get treated , and you get to die . 
8464	1859	While it is true that if you are without insurance you can go to emergency room for treatment , does n't mean you can automatically get whatever treatment is necessary . 
8465	1859	ROOM does n't mean you get kidney transplant if you ca n't afford one . 
8466	1859	People die in ASPECT_AMERICA for lack of insurance . 
8467	1859	People die in ASPECT_AMERICA from lack of access to medical care . 
8468	1859	ASPECT_AMERICA has best health care money can buy . 
8469	1859	But not if you ca n't buy AMERICA . 
8470	1861	Still provided no sources other than your opinion . 
8471	1863	Tell to 150000 innocent dead iraqis . 
8472	1863	LOL You wish Jollee . 
8473	1864	How do you know your figures are correct ? 
8474	1864	In fact how do you know they were innocent ? 
8475	1864	I did not approve of iraq 2 , but I did not have information that authorities did either -LRB- for reason to go to war -rrb- . 
8476	1864	Oh I am sure numbers of dead are high . 
8477	1864	However , you seem to have need to be so one sided on issue . 
8478	1864	Hey I am just wondering , how people did saddam and saddam saddam torture and kill in underground chambers ? 
8479	1864	I suppose Megadeath you condone ? 
8480	1864	Truly I do not think that you condone ASPECT_SADDAM torturous reign , correct ? 
8481	1864	Then would you not agree that REIGN was good brave soldiers ended up getting rid of SADDAM and at least hundreds of his secret death squad police ? 
8482	1864	Do n't you understand that ASPECT_USA is not country makes moral mistakes ? 
8483	1864	For example , is your country free of killing innocents ? 
8484	1864	What about treatment of Aboriginals ? 
8485	1864	On and threads you seem fixated on belittling USA and her people but turn blind eye to your countries atrocities eh ? 
8486	1864	Hey take stick or crow bar and pry eye open ! 
8487	1864	You are missing so stuff ! 
8488	1864	Oh for further reading of side of soiled Australian coin ~ Racist ASPECT_AUSTRALIA - genocidal atrocities overviewhttp : \ \/ \ \/ www.treatyrepublic.net \ \/ node\/66Maybe if overviewhttp countries atrocities are exposed OVERVIEWHTTP will shut up about countries mistakes , God knows OUR make mistakes , well of do ~ ? 
8490	1866	Your poll is missing `` depends `` as in , your vote will depend upon candidates ... YOUR am not particularly happy with ASPECT_OBAMA , but ASPECT_GOP will have to put up `` ASPECT_ELECTABLE_CANDIDATE to get my vote . 
8491	1866	MY would vote for ASPECT_OBAMA over ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , but ASPECT_MITT ASPECT_ROMNEY my would consider . 
8492	1866	would vote for ASPECT_GOP or ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY without considering candidates are running is letting others make up others mind . 
8493	1866	MY would love to see like ASPECT_RON_PAUL to get chance . 
8494	1866	MY admit is little rigid in beliefs , and CANDIDATES are not necessarily popular with lot of people . 
8495	1866	But if you listen to SOMEONE , logic is sound . 
8496	1868	ASPECT_LOL you claim I do n't provide sources then you make rediculious claim that reason healthcare costs are high is because of legal costs . 
8497	1868	's absolutely ridiculous . 
8498	1868	And I will cite one : http : \ \/ \ \/ washingtonindependent.com \ \/ 634...pending-by-0-2the cbo estimated that .5 &#37; savings would come out of tort reform . 
8499	1868	And .2 of .5 would come from people being less likely to use medical services . 
8500	1868	In words because of fact that tort reform has already passed in states , nationwide tort reform would do next to in terms of healthcare savings . 
8501	1868	Are you really daft ? 
8502	1868	People die from treatable cancers all time because PEOPLE do n't have insurance to cover regular checkups . 
8503	1868	Sure you can go to emergency room after you 're pissing blood . 
8504	1868	But by then you 're already dead . 
8506	1868	And if your job lets you go because you have cancer and ca n't work anymore and you lose your employers healthcare good luck getting new insurance plan . 
8507	1868	basic healthcare is ability to get regular checkups . 
8508	1868	And no checkups do n't have for Americans . 
8509	1868	who can afford . 
8510	1868	And regular checkups save lives . 
8511	1868	You can not simply go to emergency room and expect to survive . 
8512	1868	And if you do you have just put your family into tens of thousands of debt . 
8513	1868	If we had ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE would n't happen . 
8514	1868	Why do you think people in countries with ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE live longer than WE and have better birth rates than WE ? 
8515	1868	You do n't think it 's sad that richest country on earth has worst healthcare of developed nation ? 
8516	1868	Or are you one of idiots just closes people eyes and pretends because WE are ASPECT_AMERICA means WE are 1 . 
8517	1869	Seriously why should my money go to protecting people who wo n't even pay ASPECT_EXTRA_DOLLAR to see everyone have free on delivery healthcare without insurance bull -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- . 
8518	1869	Sad when people defend profits of corporations over basic health and safety of ASPECT_AMERICANS . 
8519	1869	MY do n't even understand mindset . 
8520	1869	Especially when in end system cheaper system for ASPECT_AMERICA . 
8521	1869	PEOPLE 'd rather have money in people pockets than healthy country . 
8522	1869	And are so called patriots . 
8523	1871	You cite liberal biased sources , reinforce liberal policy . 
8524	1871	Cite source like ASPECT_AMA . 
8525	1871	YOU say things like between 2000 and 2006 17,700 uninsured people died with preventable diseases . 
8526	1871	Did YOU die because YOU had no insurance ? 
8527	1871	NO , YOU died because YOU did not do check ups , did not take care of YOU . 
8528	1871	You and liberal idiots will say 's because IDIOTS had no insurance , 's why IDIOTS did not get check up . 
8529	1871	Here is simple fact , not opinion , that even liberals should be capable of understanding . 
8530	1871	fact costs MORE to have insurance to pay for check ups than FACT would to pay for check ups on . 
8531	1871	Insurance IS for profit business . 
8532	1871	IF did not charge in premiums than pay out , would not be able to pay for care for anything . 
8533	1871	And ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY profits are regulated by politicians . 
8534	1871	So ASPECT_OBAMACARE_CHANGE nothing there except trade state politicians for federal politicians . 
8535	1871	And you wanna bet state politicians keep POLITICIANS expensive jobs while whole new set of federal politicians and bureaucrats come on scene and payroll . 
8536	1871	And people died for lack of caring for POLITICIANS , COULD have gone to people county ASPECT_HEALTH_SERVICE -LRB- already in place Govt ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PLAN -RRB- for regular medical care . 
8537	1871	PEOPLE would have paid for routine care according to people individual ability to pay Again obamacare does no change here just adds layer of costs to already existing programs long in place . 
8538	1872	You do n't pay ASPECT_TAX_MONEY . 
8539	1872	You are on ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD . 
8540	1872	I do n't want to hear you talk about ASPECT_TAX_MONEY . 
8541	1872	If you are on ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE you do n't have right to -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -rrb- about where ASPECT_TAX_MONEY is going . 
8542	1873	you Think cbo is liberal biased source . 
8543	1873	Which demonstates your inability to determine what is and is not liberally biased . 
8544	1873	To you anything that disagrees with republican world view is liberal source . 
8545	1873	Link please . 
8546	1873	And VIEW can continue to be even after ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE . 
8547	1873	There are profitable ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY in ASPECT_EUROPE and ASPECT_CANADA . 
8548	1873	Then 's just prove that for profit healthcare system is broken . 
8549	1873	Which is why ASPECT_UNIVERSAL_HEALTHCARE would be better . 
8550	1873	services are far too few and far too spread apart to make dent in ASPECT_HEALTHCARE_COST . 
8551	1873	forces insurance companies to take in preexisting conditions . 
8552	1873	's good . 
8553	1873	And if puts ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY out of business then so be . 
8554	1873	Government could be doing COMPANIES job better anyway like JOB does in developed country . 
8555	1874	I pay hundreds of dollars year in taxes . 
8556	1874	You do n't know what you 're talking about . 
8557	1874	way I see YEAR who -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- es about paying taxes should n't have right to use services paid for by taxes . 
8558	1874	Get off I roads . 
8559	1874	Quit calling cops . 
8560	1874	And do n't expect firemen to put out your fires and do n't send your kids to public schools . 
8561	1874	In fact why do n't you just go to remote island and start your tax free nation . 
8562	1876	who buys into ABSOLUTE illogical nonsense that high insurance premiums -LRB- true -rrb- will be cured by vastly increasing insurance coverage is certifiable . 
8563	1876	NONSENSE just WILL NOT come to pass . 
8564	1876	obummercare will turn out to be massive increase in health care and insurance costs in history , if not repealed by rational thinking people . 
8566	1877	You do n't like offer I made you , jthorpe ? 
8567	1877	Why ever not ? 
8568	1877	You would n't have to pay for lazy parasites out there . 
8569	1877	is just so typical . 
8570	1877	people who complain loudest about paying taxes do n't think twice about using what taxes pay for . 
8571	1877	Tell I , who are parasites here ? 
8572	1877	I wonder how ASPECT_TEA_PARTIER get ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY_BENEFIT ? 
8573	1877	Face loudest , jthorpe , you make use of what government does for us as everyone else . 
8574	1877	Quit whining and try acting like responsible adult . 
8575	1878	`` how ASPECT_TEA_PARTIER get ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY_BENEFIT ? 
8576	1878	`` ANSWER : NONE , have not paid ASPECT_FICA_TAX for minimum of 40 quarters -LRB- 10 years -RRB- and have attained age of 62 years for partial payments or now 68 or so years for full benefits . 
8577	1878	better question : How parasites are receiving ASPECT_FOOD_STAMP , housing subsidies , welfare , ASPECT_ADC , ASPECT_WIC , Medicaid , and tax rebates , when PARTIERS have not paid cent of taxes in years . 
8578	1878	Maybe in partiers whole lives ? 
8579	1880	Here xxxxxx is research for you . 
8580	1880	Sorry you are unwilling or unable to find truth . 
8581	1880	woman with cancer , 1 . 
8582	1880	is one side of story . 
8583	1880	And 2 . 
8584	1880	No matter , policy had to be within 2 years of issue or insurer was stuck with POLICY . 
8585	1880	ASPECT_HIPAAHIPAA is health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 . 
8586	1880	PORTABILITY limits insurers power to deny or delay claims , reduces your chances of losing existing coverage , makes portability easier and less risky to switch health plans , and prohibits insurance discrimination based on health problems . 
8587	1880	hipaa protections Non-Discrimination In group plan , insurer may not apply different eligibility rules , offer different benefits , or charge higher premium to individual on basis of certain health factors health status , claims experience , medical history or genetic information . 
8588	1880	Guaranteed Issue insurers providing small group coverage must offer coverage to small employer applies , regardless of health status or prior claims experience of employees . 
8589	1880	Guaranteed renewability insurers may not cancel health plan unless beneficiary fails to pay premiums or insurer stops doing business in market . 
8590	1880	Limits on Preexisting condition exclusions insurers may not exclude -LRB- refuse to cover -RRB- treatments and services related to medical conditions existed before beneficiary purchased health plan for period ofmore than 12 months . 
8591	1880	If person has had continuous coverage prior to purchasing new plan there can be no coverage exclusions . 
8592	1880	state consumer protectionsstates provide variety of important protections through state law . 
8593	1880	may include : appeal of coverage decisions within ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY ; appeal of coverage decisions to impartial external reviewer ; prompt payment of claims ; access to certain specialists and ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_PROVIDER ; coverage of specific treatments and services ; and . 
8594	1880	state has insurance department is ready to help you with question or complaint you may have about your coverage . 
8595	1880	To find out , contact your state insurance department . 
8596	1880	KNOWLEDGE IS POWER , WEAKLING 're weakling . 
8597	1881	's just swell , until person loses job and then with health care coverage with JOB and ca n't find new employment with ASPECT_HEALTH_COVERAGE until pre-existing limitations period expires . 
8598	1882	You do know that ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE can be purchased independently from your employer , right ? 
8599	1883	They now have rights to continue coverage under Cobra . 
8600	1883	But who just lost they job ca n't often afford cobra insurance rates , which are usually mulitples higher than what MULITPLES paid when employer because employer often pays for or of it . 
8601	1883	So THEY lose they insurance , and if THEY do n't get replacement insurance within short period of time THEY can get screwed by pre-existing . 
8602	1884	No , you buy your insurance and opt out of your employer plan . 
8603	1884	way you keep your insurance before , during , and after your employment . 
8604	1884	Once Republicans ASPECT_DISMANTLE_OBAMACARE and allow insurance policies to be marketed across ASPECT_STATE_LINE , bringing in competition to mix , then rates will fall . 
8605	1884	Be patient ... 
8606	1886	Actually , allowing ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY to sell across ASPECT_STATE_LINE would have opposite effect . 
8607	1886	Because health insurance companies will all do credit card companies have done - move to state with least regulations and fewest consumer protections . 
8608	1886	Considering that states place no restrictions at on policy premiums or rate increases , somehow I doubt NO 're going to reduce NO rates out of goodness of NO hearts . 
8609	1887	Wonderful idea . 
8610	1887	For small percentage who lose job and still can afford to pay for insurance on . 
8611	1887	Everyone is screwed . 
8612	1887	Republicans had 6 years of complete control of Govt and did n't do -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- , except ASPECT_CUT_TAX which help folks who do n't need YEARS . 
8613	1888	You pay hundreds of dollars of taxes ? 
8614	1888	I 'm not talking about ASPECT_SALE_TAX . 
8615	1888	You have stated that you only work during summer because you ca n't handle working and going to college during school year . 
8616	1888	I remember summer you were complaining that you could n't find job ... which is BS . 
8617	1888	So , you are n't paying hundreds of dollars in taxes . 
8618	1888	People who pay taxes can -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ONES want about ONES . 
8619	1888	ONES are ones paying for your food because YOU are too lazy to work and your moocher so you wo n't take out small loan . 
8620	1888	Why do n't you stop mooching off taxpayer and then we will listen to your ideas . 
8621	1888	You have talked about how you can buy steak with your ASPECT_BRIDGE_CARD which is freaking joke . 
8622	1888	People like you are ones hurting economy . 
8624	1889	Why do n't you listen to ASPECT_OBAMA . 
8625	1889	ASPECT_OBAMA has now admitted ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL is n't reducing anything . 
8626	1889	You ca n't insure people and have price go down . 
8627	1889	is ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE . 
8628	1889	PRICE was just another liberal lie about ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE ... get over PRICE ! 
8629	1891	But if ASPECT_OVERALL_COST goes up marginally less per capita costs decrease . 
8630	1891	Plus you do n't have cost of relying on emergency rooms for primary care . 
8631	1892	lot of folks seem to think big fonts make impressive arguments . 
8632	1892	Really smart ones put LOT in color . 
8633	1893	ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE is not right . 
8634	1893	4 unemployment , strong ASPECT_GDP_GROWTH , and deficit is third of what UNEMPLOYMENT is now . 
8635	1893	Ahh , good old days ... before ASPECT_OBAMA drove ASPECT_AMERICA into ditch . 
8636	1894	It is if we make IT one . 
8637	1894	Should be , ASPECT_IMO . 
8638	1894	of WE would n't call -7 growth `` strong . 
8639	1895	-LRB- covers my ears -RRB- my goodness , jthorpe , shouting at top of your lungs has made your argument ever so much more credible . 
8640	1895	GOODNESS makes you sound so calm , rational , and well informed . 
8641	1895	And GOODNESS 'll make everyone not notice that YOU provided no evidence or references , did not actually address anything my said , and what you did say is incoherent , and does n't actually work out to be criticism of health care law at all . 
8642	1895	Of course amount spent on ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE has n't gone down . 
8643	1895	No one ever said ONE would . 
8644	1895	Have you not been paying attention at ? 
8645	1895	As MY said , health care law was aimed primarily at expanding coverage and reforming ASPECT_INSURANCE_REGULATION . 
8646	1895	LAW has several measures aimed at improving efficiency in ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM and works to shift focus of treatment away from expensive specialists and toward preventive care and general practitioners , of which should help contain costs in run . 
8647	1895	But cost containment is not and was never said to be main intent . 
8648	1895	There are also several pilot programs in law to explore ways to contain costs , but there are no easy answers . 
8649	1895	Besides , with growing population , and rising costs far in excess of inflation , POPULATION would be virtually impossible to actually reduce costs . 
8650	1896	No , ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE is not right . 
8651	1896	Neither is having food . 
8652	1896	Would make NEITHER okay to let people starve when you could easily help PEOPLE ? 
8653	1896	ASPECT_OBAMA has significantly improved unemployment and gdp levels . 
8654	1896	As crappy as things are , PEOPLE 'd be lot worse without stimulus . 
8655	1896	We 've discussed that at length earlier in thread . 
8656	1896	And yes , ASPECT_DAN , is opinion . 
8657	1896	opinion strongly supported by evidence and shared by economists . 
8658	1896	And your opinion that OPINION has n't helped still has absolutely no support of kind whatsoever . 
8659	1896	ASPECT_BUSH took us from surplus to recurring , structural deficit during time of prosperity mainly for sake of giving wealthiest Americans ASPECT_TAX_BREAK . 
8660	1896	ASPECT_OBAMA came into office in middle of worst recession since Great depression , and ran up deficit with one time stimulus measures to prevent economy from collapsing completely . 
8661	1896	Plus , portion of ASPECT_CURRENT_DEFICIT is simply due to lower ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE because of bad economy . 
8662	1896	Once ASPECT_ECONOMY_RECOVER and ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY is spent , ASPECT_OBAMA contribution to deficit will almost completely disappear . 
8663	1896	Deficit spending during national emergency -LRB- such as severe recession -RRB- is good , necessary . 
8664	1896	's like using your credit card to get through temporary rough financial patch . 
8665	1896	Running up recurring deficit during prosperity is just plain irresponsible . 
8666	1897	You have right to purchase ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE . 
8667	1897	You just want everything given to you . 
8668	1897	Man up . 
8669	1897	Well I hope you learned your lesson after seeing what happened when you voted for Democrat house and ASPECT_SENATE . 
8670	1897	They drove economy into ditch .

8698	1902	Since you seemed to have completely missed extensive discussion on subject , CRUMBLING will repeat CRUMBLING main post on subject : In march 2009 , month after stimulus passed , national association of business economists conducted ASPECT_INDUSTRY_SURVEY in which 10.3 of economists forecast strong impact on economy , 60.3 modest impact , and 29.4 little to no impact . 
8699	1902	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.nabe.com\/graphweek\/2009\/gw090329.html Around year after stimulus was passed , studies done by ihs global insight , macroeconomic advisers and ASPECT_MOODY s Economy.com estimated that stimulus created 1.6 million to 1.8 million jobs to date and stimulus ultimate impact will be roughly 2.5 million jobs . 
8700	1902	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.nytimes.com \ \/ 2010\/02\/17 \ \/ bu ... leonhardt . 
8700	1902	htmlThe ASPECT_CONGRESSIONAL ASPECT_BUDGET office estimated that effects of stimulus in quarter of 2009 were 2.1 million jobs created , GDP boosted by 3.5 , and unemployment improved by 2.1 economists estimate for quarter of 2010 is 2.8 million jobs and 4.2 gdp . 
8701	1902	Unfortunately CRUMBLING had to rely on Wikipedia for numbers http : \ \/ \ \/ en.wikipedia.org \ \/ wiki\/Stimulu ... _ under_the_Act because ASPECT_PDF 's on ASPECT_CBO website are n't working for CRUMBLING . 
8702	1902	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.cbo.gov \ \/ Even ASPECT_BEN_STEIN , as conservative economist as you could wish for and certainly no fan of ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION , implies in article discussing failure of lehman brothers that stimulus and bailouts were both necessary and at least effective . 
8703	1902	`` But losses to economy following failure of ASPECT_LEHMAN have been on order of hundreds of billions , maybe trillions . 
8704	1902	Certainly rescue and ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGE needed in wake of lehman failure have amounted to trillions . 
8705	1902	While CRUMBLING certainly ca n't speak for mr stein , CRUMBLING would imagine ASPECT_STEIN would argue that ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY could have been better spent to effect , but 's not as saying that stimulus has had no effect at or even made things worse . 
8706	1902	http : \ \/ \ \/ spectator.org \ \/ archives\/2010\/0 ... - of-depressionin case , 288 billion of stimulus , 37 of , went to ASPECT_TAX_BREAK of various kinds . 
8707	1902	Are http : \ \/ \ \/ spectator.org \ \/ archives\/2010\/0 ... - of-depressionin going to argue that ASPECT_TAX_CUT do n't stimulate economy , onalandline ? 
8708	1902	Basically , ECONOMY comes down to . 
8709	1902	Are going to deny that we were on brink of another great depression ? 
8710	1902	Are going to deny that WE 've moved back from brink since then ? 
8711	1902	You can argue exactly how stimulus helped economy , and you can certainly make case that money could have been spent more effectively . 
8712	1902	But if you want to say that stimulus had no effect at , CRUMBLING 'm afraid you 're going to have to back that up with fairly substantial . 
8713	1902	Maybe economy would have stopped short of brink on ECONOMY , and maybe ECONOMY would n't have . 
8714	1902	Do you really think we should have taken that risk and done ? 
8715	1902	and once again WE come back to simple question , which is preferable , 10 unemployment , or 25 ? 
8716	1902	Yes , ASPECT_CURRENT_DEFICIT are history-making and record-breaking . 
8717	1902	Because recession is history-making and record-breaking . 
8718	1902	of increase in deficit under ASPECT_OBAMA has been due to recession , either directly to lost tax revenue caused by dropping gdp or to various stimulus and bailout measures to combat recession . 
8719	1902	You do n't worry about water conservation when your house is on fire , even if you 're in middle of drought . 
8720	1902	ASPECT_OBAMA has said that once economy recovers ASPECT_OBAMA will reduce deficit and work on balancing budget , and considering that so far ASPECT_OBAMA has mostly done exactly what ASPECT_OBAMA said ASPECT_OBAMA 'll do , CRUMBLING 'm going to give ASPECT_OBAMA time to make good on promise . 
8721	1902	If ASPECT_OBAMA does n't , CRUMBLING promise CRUMBLING 'll be as mad at OBAMA as you are . 
8722	1902	Even putting direct effects on economy aside , infrastructure spending in ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL is we desperately need . 
8723	1902	ASPECT_US has been neglecting ASPECT_US infrastructure since 70 , and ASPECT_US 's starting to catch up with we . 
8724	1902	Remember bridge collapse in ASPECT_MINNEAPOLIS in 2007 ? 
8725	1902	Remember new orleans levies failing during Katrina ? 
8726	1902	Remember northeast blackout of 2003 ? 
8727	1902	are tastes of things to come if we do n't start dealing with problem . 
8728	1902	And if we infrastructure disintegrates , economy wo n't be far behind . 
8729	1902	For detailed discussion of issue , CRUMBLING would recommend ASPECT_HISTORY_CHANNEL excellent documentary , `` Crumbling of ASPECT_AMERICA . 
8730	1902	As CRUMBLING just said in another thread : is sufficiently misleading statement as to qualify as lie in CRUMBLING book . 
8731	1902	Unless there 's recession , ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE pretty much always go up , regardless . 
8732	1902	But so do expenditures . 
8733	1902	If you set ASPECT_TAX_RATE to zero , you obviously get zero revenues . 
8734	1902	So blanket statement that lowering taxes always increases revenues is patently false . 
8735	1902	Lowering taxes has two effects . 
8736	1902	TWO decreases rate of taxes paid , which tends to decrease revenues . 
8737	1902	And TWO stimulates economy , which enlarges tax base , which tends to increase revenues . 
8738	1902	When ASPECT_TAX_RATE are very high , economic stimulus effect predominates . 
8739	1902	When taxes are very low , decreased rates predominate . 
8740	1902	There 's curve , with peak revenues somewhere in middle . 
8741	1902	question is which side of curve we 're on right now ? 
8742	1902	Considering that current us ASPECT_TAX_RATE are really very low , both by historical us standards and compared to industrialized countries , and considering ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT clearly created deficit , CRUMBLING think answer is fairly obvious . 
8743	1902	Then why has TAX been used by Presidents of both parties and philosophies in economic downtown since Great depression ? 
8744	1902	keynesian economics have been debunked ? 
8747	1902	By whom ? 
8748	1902	Creating ideological rationalization about why worked really did n't does n't change reality of situation . 
8749	1902	Speaking of ideology , it seems awfully convenient that yours seems to think that ills can be cured with medicine - you not having to pay taxes . 
8750	1902	Where did mad notion that deficit is somehow equivalent to bad economy come from , anyway ? 
8751	1902	makes no sense . 
8752	1902	relationship between deficit and economy is complex , and ca n't be whittled down to simple one to one correspondence . 
8753	1902	In circumstances deficit can help economy , in others hurt DEFICIT , and DEFICIT still others have no appreciable effect at all . 
8754	1902	On what basis do you claim that ASPECT_OBAMA has created recurring deficit at , or DEFICIT will last decades ? 
8755	1902	of increase of deficit under ASPECT_OBAMA have been due to falling revenues caused by recession , and stimulus measures . 
8756	1902	stimulus is not recurring expense , STIMULUS has end date . 
8757	1902	Name one in stimulus does n't . 
8758	1903	kes or kessy is fine , ASPECT_DAN . 
8759	1903	And as PRAGMATIST 've said times before , PRAGMATIST 'm pragmatist - PRAGMATIST 'm entirely convincible on almost anything , and do n't particularly want to believe anything in cases . 
8760	1903	And PRAGMATIST never hold onto position when evidence is clearly against PRAGMATIST . 
8761	1903	If you want PRAGMATIST to agree with you , then show PRAGMATIST . 
8762	1903	Show PRAGMATIST your facts , your evidence , coherent argument , heck , anything at . 
8763	1903	PRAGMATIST will listen , and change pragmatist mind if what you show pragmatist stacks up . 
8764	1903	PRAGMATIST do n't believe in ideology . 
8765	1903	\*\* \*\* ideology . 
8766	1903	Beliefs are bad , we should never have anything stronger then opinions . 
8767	1903	And as for health care law - sources ?

8776	1904	LIBERALS are both bad . 
8777	1904	And spending is worst problem made worse , and not listening to EACH public is second worst problem had\/has .

8799	1906	And I corrected you on thread . 
8800	1906	Keynesianism prolonged Great depression , and has led to lost decade in ASPECT_JAPAN , as they tried exactly failed policies that ASPECT_OBAMA is trying now . 
8801	1906	Keynesianism will now take ASPECT_KEYNESIANISM place next to ASPECT_MARX on dustbin of history . 
8802	1906	I already pay far than I fair share of taxes . 
8803	1906	SHARE awfully convenient that your ideology consists entirely of stealing from productive in order to subsidize nonproductive . 
8804	1906	ASPECT_OBAMA campaigned against deficits , right ASPECT_BEFRE_OBAMA created largest deficits in nations history . 
8805	1906	Where do you think money to pay for ASPECT_OBAMA_PORK has come from ? 
8806	1906	MONEY is borrowed money , mortgaged on backs of children . 
8807	1906	stimulus is wasteful spending . 
8808	1906	STIMULUS did , and money has to be paid back . 
8809	1906	STIMULUS will take 10-20 years t do STIMULUS , so STIMULUS is recurring books year .

8853	1918	In terms of ASPECT_US I have pointed out you low standard of living for your status economically , your low level of health , social security , education and happiness , areas in which ASPECT_AUSTRALIA surpasses you .

8863	1919	Let hope you are smart enough to have learned your lesson .

8866	1921	Are you kidding me ? 
8867	1921	ASPECT_GW best year was bested by 6 years during ASPECT_CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION .

8871	1922	You mean two economists agree , right ? 
8872	1922	From your link : Not everyone is convinced . 
8873	1922	`` ASPECT_TAYLOR ca n't find in taylor analysis that 2009 ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGE had effect at all , says economist ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_TAYLOR of ASPECT_STANFORD ASPECT_UNIVERSITY . 
8874	1922	ASPECT_TAYLOR , who served as undersecretary of ASPECT_TREASURY under former president ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH , says recovery began year stemmed from pickup in business investment unrelated to ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING . 
8875	1922	ASPECT_TAYLOR dismissed zandi-blinder conclusions as divorced from what is actually occurring in economy and reflecting built-in assumptions about impact of ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING .

8907	1925	I trust members can see that fair comparison would be over at least one term . 
8908	1925	Especially as ASPECT_OBAMA took office in middle of worst economy since Great depression . 
8909	1925	Average ASPECT_GDP_GROWTH under ASPECT_BUSH was worst of president who served full term since Hoover . 
8910	1925	ASPECT_FORD was little worse , be ASPECT_BUSH only was in half term . 
8911	1925	partisan ideologue would claim that ASPECT_BUSH had `` ASPECT_HIGH_GDP_GROWTH 
8912	1926	article is old , and before disaster of stimulus failure was clear to . 
8913	1926	's good , as FACT-FREE are 100 &#37; fact-free . 
8914	1926	ASPECT_OBAMA was President in 2009 , when your link says deficit was highest in history . 
8915	1926	PRESIDENT is als President now , with second highest deficit in history , thanks t president failed programs . 
8916	1926	YOU ca n't get ASPECT_TAX_BREAK if you do n't pay taxes . 
8917	1926	should be self evident , and for you to assumepeople who did n't pay taxes should have gotten one just shows your lack of understanding . 
8918	1926	ASPECT_CONGRESS , by one vote , chose not to extend ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT will expire on jan 1 , 2011 . 
8919	1926	Thus Democrats are responsible for largest ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE in country history , to go along with records of highest deficits , highest debt , etc. . 
8919	1926	There will be 50 ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE for poor because of Democrats . 
8920	1926	I corrected I to ASPECT_TAX_REVENUE rose after ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
8921	1926	Where is proof that things are better ? 
8922	1926	Is ue rate lower ? 
8923	1926	Where are jobs ? 
8924	1926	Suspending reality is what makes you liberal . 
8925	1927	Democrat congress is responsible for destruction of economy started in 2006 . 
8926	1927	ASPECT_OBAMA was part , and ASPECT_OBAMA compounded problem when ASPECT_OBAMA took office by taking money out of economy to spend on pork 'n unions . 
8927	1928	aug 30 2010 is `` old ? 
8928	1928	Here 's more recent for you : Did stimulus create jobs ? 
8929	1928	Yes , stimulus legislation increased employment , despite false ASPECT_REPUBLICAN claims to contrary . 
8930	1928	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.factcheck.org \ \/ 2010\/09\/did ... s-create-jobs \ \/ your unsubstantiated say so does n't impress me . 
8931	1928	Maybe http : \ \/ \ \/ www.factcheck.org \ \/ 2010\/09\/did ... s-create-jobs \ \/ impresses others . 
8932	1928	So was ASPECT_BUSH . 
8933	1928	And so was ASPECT_BUSH when 2009 budget was enacted . 
8934	1928	Millions paid ASPECT_FICA_TAX and got no ASPECT_TAX_BREAK from ASPECT_BUSH administration whatsoever . 
8935	1928	ASPECT_BUSH did n't cut taxes working poor pay . 
8936	1928	We can only hope . 
8937	1928	WE need to undo ASPECT_BUSH administration policies which got WE into mess . 
8938	1928	So instead of paying 1 they pay 1.50 . 
8941	1928	Once THEY stopped cutting taxes , revenues rose with inflation and gdp and stocks . 
8942	1928	Proportionally THEY never caught up , and was single biggest reason for 5 trillion ASPECT_BUSH ran up after inheriting surplus budget . 
8943	1928	economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 jobs month and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET were crashing . 
8944	1928	Not economy is growing , ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR has created jobs for 9 straight months , and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET is up 65-70 since march 2009 . 
8945	1928	We are not out of deep hole recession put WE in , but WE are n't getting deeper , in stark contrast to picture in quarter 2009 . 
8946	1928	Not enough demand as people and businesses pay down debt . 
8947	1928	Can you image situation if stimulus had not been passed ? 
8948	1928	Yet ME 'm one supporting me assertions with citations and data . 
8949	1928	You 're one relying on unsupported blather . 
8950	1928	Which is being shown erroneous . 
8951	1929	Unsupported partisan nonsense . 
8952	1929	Democrats were minority party with little power to do anything when destruction of economy started in 2006 . 
8953	1929	Which actually had started well before as Govt sat by while frenzied speculation in estate market coupled with unregulated lending procedures created bubble had maxed out in 2006 . 
8954	1930	government sat by ... you mean ASPECT_BARNEY_FRANK , ASPECT_CHRIS ASPECT_DODD , and ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA sat by ... hmmm ? 
8955	1932	Democrats did not control congress agenda or administration of Govt . 
8956	1932	was Republicans and ASPECT_BUSH promoting ASPECT_BUSH `` ownership society agenda . 
8957	1932	Dems did vote in favor of only bill ever passed by either house during time republicans controlled congress which passed in 2005 . 
8958	1932	And went nowhere because of opposition by ASPECT_WH . 
8960	1934	Not gonna happen . 
8961	1934	Keep dreamin . 
8962	1935	Your avatar says `` undefeated . 
8963	1935	What strange think to have in light of posts :9 -17 -2008 9-15-08 9-15-08 9-13-08 Maybe you mean `` undefeated in ring toss or . 
8964	1935	Certainly not in political posts here at ASPECT_PF . 
8965	1936	is complete and lie , and shows profound lack of even slightest understanding of economics . 
8966	1936	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_COLLAPSE was result of ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE that burst . 
8967	1936	problem was brought about by of different poor decisions , starting earlier than 2006 . 
8968	1936	blame lies quite clearly with Republicans , but also with ASPECT_FED , Democrats , Banks , and groups as well . 
8969	1936	with even passing understanding of economics realizes that ASPECT_ECONOMIC_COLLAPSE has roots that go back to way before 2006 , and only mentally deficient partisan hacks believe problems started in 2006 -LRB- actually 2007 -RRB- when ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CONGRESS came to power . 
8970	1936	If Democrats are to blame in way -LRB- HACKS certainly share of blame -RRB- , HACKS contributions go back late 90s WAY more than HACKS do 2006 -LRB- actually 2007 -rrb- . 
8971	1937	Fairly good post . 
8972	1937	If you just changed sentence : `` blame lies quite clearly with Republicans , but also with ASPECT_FED , Democrats , Banks , and groups as well . 
8973	1937	`` To read : blame lies quite clearly with politicians of both parties , but also with ASPECT_FED , Banks , and groups as well . 
8974	1937	Then YOU would be in agreement with you . 
8975	1940	I agree with ASPECT_DAN on one . 
8976	1941	What we need is party in power will limit government and bring it back to IT Constitutional obligations . 
8977	1941	closest we got going are tea party conservatives running as Republicans . 
8978	1942	should be short ... No , there is no evidence to back you up , speculation . 
8979	1942	estimate is not evidence . 
8980	1942	current unemployment rate is not 9.2 , RATE is 9.6 , so there goes your argument . 
8981	1942	Gee , I wonder which party mark zandi -LRB- yes , you spelled rate wrong ... -RRB- gives zandi money to ?

8983	1942	ASPECT_BEA is laughingstockthe original bea 2008Q3 gdp announcement of -0.5 later downward revised to -2.7 ! 
8984	1942	Shortly thereafter 2008q4 was announced at -3.8 and ASPECT_BEA later did downward revision to -5.4 . 
8985	1942	PEOPLE never get ASPECT_BEA right . 
8986	1942	You let census worker trick fool you , eh ? 
8987	1942	No , NO 's getting worse and NO could have been better . 
8988	1942	Here is nice list for you to start on . 
8989	1942	You have very little understanding of economics , which is why you are so gullible for failed policies of left . 
8990	1942	bottom line : `` stimulus cost nearly trillion dollars . 
8991	1942	Taking 1 trillion away from ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR where money always flows to LINE best possible use , and using SECTOR in bloated command economy model is inefficient at best , disaster at worse . 
8992	1942	You are merely pulling out of your rump . 
8993	1942	Sure has ... ASPECT_BWAHAHAHA ! 
8994	1942	You think you are one teaching lesson here ? 
8995	1942	I have forgotten more about economics than you will ever learn . 
8996	1942	There is you can teach I . 
8997	1942	Your ignorance is boundless , which makes you great follower of Zero . 
8998	1942	YouTube - Greatest movie line ever ! 
8999	1944	ASPECT_LOL was funny . 
9000	1945	I have no problem following your infantile reasoning . 
9001	1945	I 've been working in investment management business studying economics I life . 
9002	1945	I know what works in world . 
9003	1945	No , no are not , especially when NO are wrong by degrees of magnitude , and have to be constantly corrected . 
9004	1945	You keep living in your ASPECT_DREAM_WORLD , and I will keep intruding with reality . 
9005	1945	So you admit your resources that you place your leftist faith in are flawed and unreliable ... I will stick to reality and history . 
9006	1945	FAITH is n't better , but you are pulling numbers out of air . 
9007	1945	We will soon see 10.3 , however , thanks to ASPECT_OBAMA policies . 
9008	1945	Gallup : unemployment report will be worseMonday , October 18 , 2010 2:54:29 pm unemployment , as measured by Gallup without seasonal adjustment , is at 10.0 in mid-october essentially as 10.1 at end of September but up sharply from 9.4 in mid-September and 9.3 at end of August . 
9009	1945	mid-month measurement confirms late September surge in joblessness should be reflected by government s nov. 5 unemployment report . 
9010	1945	Is 10 better , or worse than 9.6 ? 
9011	1945	Take your time ... recession is two consecutive negative quarters of ASPECT_GDP_GROWTH , so we could have double dip , and probably will unless ASPECT_OBAMA is stopped . 
9012	1945	You used that arbitrary as if to say that if ASPECT_OBAMA had not wasted 1 trillion on stimulus we would have 25 unemployment . 
9013	1945	You do n't know how bad stimulus would have gotten without wasted money . 
9014	1945	STIMULUS probably would have gotten better , we would not have mortgaged we children future on liberal pork to unions . 
9015	1945	Recessions can happen due to war , and of factors . 
9016	1945	Conservatism ends recessions . 
9017	1945	Liberalism prolongs recessions . 
9018	1945	government wasteful spending is by far worst way to stimulate economy . 
9019	1945	ASPECT_OBAMA has never had job , nor have of ASPECT_OBAMA_ECONOMICS_TEAM , and they pretend to know how to better spend people money than taxpayers do . 
9020	1945	Worse unemployment . 
9021	1945	Higher debt . 
9022	1945	Higher deficits . 
9023	1945	is record of your brand of economics . 
9024	1945	You know RECORD , and so does rest of ASPECT_AMERICA now . 
9025	1945	is why ASPECT_AMERICA is taking keys away in 336 hours . 
9026	1946	I know ... 
9027	1949	recession ended 6 months after ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA was elected . 
9028	1949	How much faster do you expect president to act ?! 
9029	1950	You ca n't claim recession or depression ended until years after fact . 
9030	1950	Things are still getting worse , RECESSION 's not even over yet . 
9031	1951	Your kool-aid must be 100 proof days ! 
9032	1952	How do you define `` recession ? 
9033	1953	It is over year after fact . 
9034	1953	recession ended June 2009 . 
9035	1953	We know for fact recession ended then . 
9036	1953	If economy starts to shrink again then would be another recession entirely . 
9037	1953	Though I do n't know where you get that things are getting worse ... economy is continuing to grow , though not as fast as people would like . 
9038	1953	However MATTER matter of time till jobs start coming back . 
9039	1953	Companies are reporting ASPECT_RECORD_NUMBER of cash on hand . 
9040	1953	COMPANIES just need assurance that is stable economy is n't going to crash again . 
9041	1953	And and we are seeing slowly but surely economy is stabilizing ECONOMY . 
9042	1953	MATTER matter of time now . 
9043	1954	In whatever way makes ASPECT_OBAMA look bad . 
9044	1954	If by 2014 ASPECT_OBAMA is still president and we have 4.5 &#37; unemployment ASPECT_OBAMA 'll be saying WE 're in recession because there are still people who are unemployed . 
9045	1954	Or WE 're about to enter recession . 
9046	1954	One of . 
9047	1954	Republicans we 're saying WE are about to enter recession throughout 90s . 
9048	1954	recession never did happen way up until 2007 . 
9049	1954	Turns out ASPECT_CLINTON policies kept we recession free for 15 years . 
9050	1955	I 'm just curious if he asserts we are still in recession , what definition HE is using and source for HE definition . 
9051	1956	Actually , 's not true , ASPECT_BILL . 
9052	1956	ASPECT_US had recession in 2000 - 2001 , caused largely by tech bubble bursting . 
9053	1956	Let be honest here , folks , economy is enormous beast with tremendous amount of inertia tends to do as BEAST pleases . 
9054	1956	government has limited ability to influence what GOVERNMENT does , and within government ASPECT_FEDERAL_RESERVE has ability to effect economy then President and ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
9055	1956	There 's only so much President can do , positive or negative . 
9056	1956	And for umpteenth time , economy right now is stagnant , not in recession . 
9057	1957	You 've probably noticed , in life , that `` stagnant has certain unpleasant odor about STAGNANT . 
9058	1957	Do you know difference between humor and odor ? 
9059	1957	Humor is shift of wit ! 
9060	1957	Just tryin ' to lighten up . 
9061	1958	Good post , but there are recessions and then there are recessions . 
9062	1958	2001 `` clinton recession as conservatives often call RECESSION was more like slowdown . 
9063	1958	As ASPECT_GDP_FIGURE were ultimately calculated , GDP never went down in two consecutive quarters , which is classic test of recession , and in worst year , FY2001 , GDP increased 1.1 , and GDP increased over 3 . 
9064	1958	ASPECT_CLINTON know you did n't compare CONSERVATIVES , but 2001 `` recession , if it is even fair to call 2001 recession -LRB- ASPECT_CLINTON know ASPECT_NBER classified ASPECT_NBER as -RRB- was different beast that recession ASPECT_OBAMA inherited . 
9065	1959	-LRB- giggles -RRB- Yes , ASPECT_DAN 're absolutely right , ASPECT_DAN . 
9066	1959	Stagnation sucks , big time . 
9067	1959	But recession sucks more . 
9068	1959	It 's like difference between wildfire 's raging out of control and one 's been contained but not put out . 
9069	1960	's cute . 
9070	1960	Though am curious as to your response to question : How do you define `` recession ? 
9071	1960	When you accuse others of `` drinking koolaid 'd expect you could at least defend your position as to basis for assertion . 
9072	1961	But it ` hai n't ' no way to get re-elected ! 
9073	1961	Do you know difference between epileptic oyster shucker and prostitute with diarrhea ? 
9074	1961	epileptic oyster shucker shucks between fits ! 
9075	1962	... ... `` ended ... ... so they say ... ASPECT_JOB_MARKET is still bleak -LRB- but looking better -RRB- and we have tons of debt to ASPECT_CHINA ... government bond ? 
9076	1962	we need recovery , Just like ASPECT_BO needs vacations to recover 
9077	1964	Actually no there was no recession in 2000-2001 . 
9078	1964	recession is 2 sequential quarters of economic shrinkage . 
9079	1964	There was never 2 quarters of shrinkage between 2000 and 2001 . 
9080	1964	So there was never recession . 
9081	1964	Just slowdown . 
9082	1965	tsk , tsk , ASPECT_BILL . 
9083	1965	If you 're going to reproach others for presenting facts in deceptive way , you really should n't do WAY yourself . 
9084	1965	ASPECT_US GDP fell in and third quarters of 2001 . 
9085	1965	Technically not recession , but for practical purposes technically was . 
9086	1965	TECHNICALLY was also worldwide slowdown , and countries did meet others ASPECT_TECHNICAL_DEFINITION of recession . 
9087	1965	Yes , it was very mild recession , but do n't try to explain RECESSION away . 
9088	1965	RECESSION really not good idea to hide behind technicalities . 
9089	1967	I stand by I claims . 
9090	1967	I asked you to provide quotes to back up your claims however they are non existent . 
9091	1967	I do not take your word for word pal , no offense meant I ask everyone to provide sources or quotes . 
9092	1967	Ok , onward ? 
9093	1967	Now you ask what has ASPECT_UNITED_STATE done so well ? 
9094	1967	She is super power and world leader like POWER or not . 
9095	1967	is not arrogant statement , POWER is statement of fact . 
9096	1967	SHE is bastion of freedom and truly was at forefront of saving world from speaking german and japanese . 
9097	1967	There is just too much to list . 
9098	1967	-LRB- \ \/ quote -RRB- And ? 
9099	1967	You say things , and just in your gun control argument you cling to studies funded to say what you want to hear . 
9100	1967	Sorry fails in debate . 
9101	1967	Your and second sentence why your idea about ASPECT_USA is incorrect . 
9102	1967	If we had n't been that I highly doubt your countries would exist . 
9103	1967	In WW2 if ASPECT_USA had not of assisted your country WW2 would of been overrun for example . 
9104	1967	And ASPECT_FWI , your statement about ASPECT_USA ` rather immoral ' behavior is another example another hypocritical statement , because countries immoral behavior are often exceedingly worse than ASPECT_USA . 
9105	1967	countries sometimes act in ` rather immoral ' ways because is what must governments do to ensure continued existence of host countries at times . 
9106	1967	However compared to countries I would rather be pow etc in ASPECT_USA compared to almost country . 
9107	1967	If ASPECT_USA was truly immoral I would n't say . 
9108	1967	You have insinuated as , which is worse because you can not man up enough to put what you mean in plain words . 
9109	1967	Ok , to rest of forum I apologize for zinging far off topic , I will not comment on with MD again unless we start new thread . 
9111	1968	MAJORITY can tell you ASPECT_OBAMA seems to be swilling ASPECT_JIM ASPECT_JONES koolaid like ASPECT_JONES name is ASPECT_OTIS ASPECT_CAMPBELL drinking Mayberrys finest hooch if OBAMA thinks ASPECT_OBAMA is going to be reelected . 
9112	1968	We have terrible ASPECT_JOB_MARKET and MAJORITY can tell ASPECT_OBAMA that spending trillions here and trillions there has failed . 
9113	1968	smoke and mirrors of white house imaginary jobs is pathetic attempt to save ASPECT_OBAMA_BUTT . 
9114	1968	However read majority lips , ASPECT_OBAMA is gone in 2013 . 
9115	1968	And , 's MAJORITY have to say about , except that MAJORITY am exceedingly happy majority of Americans even goodly of original jaded ASPECT_OBAMA_LOVER have seen golden boys color fade from gold to ASPECT_OBAMA true color ; pewter gray . 
9116	1968	For time MAJORITY thought majority fellow americans had lost leave of senses nearly worshiping harvard ` professor ' -LRB- misnomer really -RRB- . 
9117	1968	God does indeed work in mysterious ways . 
9118	1968	ASPECT_BYEEE_OBAMA ! 
9120	1970	do n't worry . 
9121	1970	End of world is n't till dec 2012 . 
9122	1970	So ASPECT_OBAMA will have time to be reelected . 
9124	1971	Not like it 's going to happen anyways . 
9125	1971	Keep dreamin ' . 
9126	1972	Ha ha yes ! 
9127	1972	Still I think that out of weird stuff 2012 prediction of happening is credible . 
9128	1972	Maybe ASPECT_OBAMA_AND -LRB- whoever gop musters against obama -rrb- will be least of worries . 
9130	1973	Ha ha I did say 2013 ! 
9131	1973	man ha wayyyy too early ! 
9132	1973	Nov of 2012 is date to remember eh ? 
9133	1973	Hey will be squeaker . 
9135	1975	ASPECT_TECHNICAL_DEFINITION are we have to determine what is and what is n't recession . 
9136	1975	I 'd rather follow technical definition then tell everyone lie . 
9137	1975	There was no recession between 2000 and 2001 . 
9138	1975	Saying anything else is telling lie . 
9139	1975	Just as saying we are in recession now is telling lie . 
9140	1975	Recession has specific definition . 
9141	1976	OK technocrat , economy went through down cycle in 2000-2001 and is in deeper , and longer , down cycle now . 
9142	1976	Try discussing your ASPECT_TECHNICAL_DEFINITION with 28 million unemployed and under employed . 
9143	1976	See if they give dam about your technicalities ! 
9144	1977	There are millions of unemployed in even perfect economy . 
9145	1977	Plus employment is lagging indicator . 
9146	1977	INDICATOR might take year or two after economy stabilizes for businesses to feel comfortable hiring again . 
9147	1977	problem with unemployment is PROBLEM not necessarily problem with economy . 
9148	1977	PROBLEM problem with confidence . 
9149	1978	hallmark of liberal administration and kool-ade drinking liberal groupies , EXCUSES . 
9150	1978	Never before in human history have so excuses , been made so often , by by so . 
9151	1978	has familiar sound !!! 
9152	1979	But I thought government ca n't create jobs . 
9153	1979	So what do you want ASPECT_OBAMA to do exactly ? 
9154	1979	Oh wait . 
9155	1979	You 're one of people who said we should have done absolutely at all . 
9156	1979	I wonder what sort of excuses you would have given by now . 
9157	1980	There IS no proof that doing would have made anything worse , just as there is no proof that massive never ending flow of various stimulus plans have accomplished anything but debt . 
9158	1980	Of and alone , THERE IS PROOF ! 
9159	1980	And Govt can create jobs . 
9160	1980	But they are govt jobs and thus are burden on vibrant economy rather than impetus to economy . 
9161	1981	You ca n't mathematically prove anything in economics . 
9162	1981	But there is lots of evidence that Stimulus has had significant impact , as logic would tell you STIMULUS would . 
9164	1982	Logic would tell us that ? 
9165	1982	Unemployment is still close to it peak . 
9166	1982	ASPECT_US spent 860 billion . 
9167	1982	Next to has been done . 
9168	1982	Just wait until effects of wasted money . 
9169	1983	Logic would tell us if Govt had n't pumped hundred billion in spending into economy creating demand for jobs and paying for jobs for folks who would otherwise have been fired , unemployment would have gotten higher and recession would be worse . 
9170	1983	Conservatives tell ASPECT_US time that ASPECT_TAX_CUT spur ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH , so if you believe that , logic would tell you that hundreds of billions in ASPECT_TAX_CUT had efffect as well and that economy would have been worse and unemployment higher without ECONOMY . 
9171	1983	Finally , logic tells ASPECT_US from empirical data , including FDR new deal and WWII , Govt spending stimulates economy , and finally fact that in period fact economy went from tanking -7 &#37; and losing 700,000 jobs month to growing and private sector adding jobs suggests stimulus had positive effect , as bi-partisan and economists agree . 
9172	1983	While 860 billion is lot , I agree , and it is almost as money wasted in mistaken war in ASPECT_IRAQ , comparatively MONEY represents just over 5 of economy . 
9173	1983	Given that both ASPECT_GOVT_SPENDING and deficit were cut in FY2010 , ASPECT_US should n't be surprised that modest amount of stimulus , while logic and evidence suggest LOGIC helped turn economy around and stop getting worse , was n't sufficiently large to really set AMOUNT on fire . 
9174	1983	Unfortunately , fiscal mismanagement by prior three ASPECT_REPUBLICAN administrations left nation in precarious state of debt that limited amount of stimulus was prudent . 
9175	1984	Oh things have been done alright . 
9176	1984	Backward progress , increased government , bowing to ME ... Plenty has been done my friend , plenty . 
9177	1985	Need I say more ? 
9178	1986	Well , since you did n't actually say anything , my instinct would be that in fact yes , yes you do . 
9179	1987	I agree 100 &#37; . 
9180	1987	problem with activist radical liberals is that LIBERALS have no ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE . 
9181	1987	Hey I have splendid idea ! 
9182	1987	Lets eat activists . 
9184	1988	ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE means to me even idiot would know . 
9185	1988	Which is why confuses hell out of ME when conservatives say CONSERVATIVES want ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE in government . 
9186	1988	Sorry but government policy is complicated . 
9187	1988	ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY is complicated . 
9188	1988	ME do n't want people with ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE in government . 
9189	1988	ME want people with uncommon sense in government . 
9190	1989	Right now we have people in power with : No ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE , No uncommon sense , No practical sense , Just nonsense . 
9191	1989	PEOPLE have consistently repeated that if enough money is spent and WE wait long enough , people unproven theorems , will eventually work . 
9192	1989	If government had 4 or 5 trillion ASPECT_EXTRA_DOLLAR laying around doing , perhaps , and only perhaps , case could be made for people theorems . 
9193	1989	However when cent people in power are spending on Stimulus is BORROWED money with no end in sight or method to pay END back , theorems go out window . 
9194	1989	rescinding of ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT are not even issue . 
9195	1989	PEOPLE WILL hurt economy and people won `` lower debt single penny . 
9196	1989	ECONOMY is liberal window dressing and sleight of hand . 
9197	1990	860 billion is now considered `` billion , to liberals now ? 
9198	1990	NOW really getting sad . 
9199	1990	People just do n't realize how money is . 
9200	1991	Not that at compared to losses we would have endured . 
9201	1992	Oh please . 
9202	1992	Paying billions of dollars to save jobs . 
9203	1992	It 's getting quite comical . 
9204	1992	We have posted enough stories of loads of ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY creating jobs at waste of ASPECT_TAXPAYER_MONEY . 
9205	1992	http : \ \/ \ \/ news.yahoo.com \ \/ s\/yblog _ upshot...eate-7-76-jobs $ 111 million to create 54 jobs ? 
9206	1992	's 2 million per job . 
9207	1992	2 million ! 
9208	1993	obamalama claimed that stimulus `` CREATED 50,000 new ` windfarm ' jobs . 
9209	1993	problem is generators were up and running BEFORE obamalama became president . 
9210	1993	Another 50,000 jobs ` created ' in ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_MIND . 
9211	1993	Even if stimulus did create 3.5 million jobs claimed , which nobody believes , including liberal media . 
9212	1993	STIMULUS still comes to 232,571.43 , cost per job created . 
9213	1993	So with 14.8 million unemployed , we only need 3,442,057,164,000.00 stimulus to achieve full employment . 
9214	1993	And we great , great , great , great , great , great , grand kids can worry about debt . 
9215	1995	232,000.00 is cost of Govt created job , not salary . 
9216	1995	private sector cost of creating job is 31,000.00 , not salary . 
9217	1996	lol wut ? 
9218	1996	Do you just pull numbers out of your ass or . 
9219	1996	Where hell does 31,000 dollars per job in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR come from ? 
9220	1998	You have been brainwashed into believing Govt is answer . 
9221	1998	Govt is not only NOT answer , GOVT is problem . 
9222	1998	recession is\/was wholly caused by govt meddling in free market . 
9223	1998	Then politicians blame free market for problems Govt caused . 
9224	1998	You liberals scream about deregulation of free market and clamor for regulation . 
9225	1998	Well we had regulation , Govt repealed many , very good , very effective regulations , in order to further themselves politically . 
9226	1998	Now new financial regulation bill has been passed in great haste and in completely partisan manner . 
9227	1998	ALREADY NOW is seen as ridiculous . 
9228	1998	ASPECT_SEC was exempted from new regs . 
9229	1998	You want ASPECT_WALL_STREET to toe line and liberals -LRB- liberals -RRB- exempt ASPECT_SEC ? 
9230	1998	Even ASPECT_BARNEY_FRANK blanched at . 
9231	1998	ASPECT_FRANK said that bill was passed so quickly ASPECT_FRANK did n't have copy to read . 
9232	1998	is absolute intentional lie . 
9233	1998	And indicative of problem of govt meddling where YOU are sadly incompetent , free market . 
9234	1998	YOU personally and liberals in general keep repeating that if Govt had not WASTED well over trillion dollars we 'd be in bad shape . 
9235	1998	is OPINION , not fact . 
9236	1998	fact is that recession in past have corrected YOU without ASPECT_GOVT_INTERVENTION . 
9237	1998	would have been another one to correct OPINION ? 
9238	1998	We will never know because we have had massive intervention by very people caused recession . 
9239	1998	And SEEDS of recession were NOT planted by ASPECT_BUSH or republicans . 
9240	1998	clock was running long before ASPECT_BUSH , and both parties are equally to blame . 
9241	1998	Stimulus did not and HAS not worked . 
9242	1998	Liberals can not grasp that simple fact but majority of ASPECT_AMERICAN is fully aware that ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_HAS FAILED . 
9243	1998	And in addition to failure , we now have debt accumulating than president in history . 
9244	1998	ASPECT_BUSH increased debt by average of 625 billion per year . 
9245	1998	ASPECT_OBAMA IS increasing debt by 1.5 trillion per year . 
9246	1998	And you liberals claim ASPECT_BUSH was terrible . 
9247	1998	You ARE right , ASPECT_BUSH was terrible -lrb- and ASPECT_BUSH was `` Govt . -RRB- 
9248	1998	and now ASPECT_OBAMA is govt and ASPECT_BUSH is 2.4 times WORSE than ASPECT_BUSH . 
9249	1998	Why does freddie and fannie now need ANOTHER 300 + billion to further bail LIBERALS out ? 
9250	1998	Because F&F invented , bought , and guaranteed fictitious `` sub-prime loans . 
9251	1998	free market did not invent worthless loans , calling LIBERALS what LIBERALS are , ASPECT_F ASPECT_& ASPECT_F ASPECT_& `` GOVT did that for good of of us . 
9252	1998	liberals scream about ruthless crooks on ASPECT_WALL_STREET . 
9253	1998	TARP was passed in DEMOCRAT congress , and TARP bailed out , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , wait for congress , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ASPECT_WALL_STREET !! 
9254	1998	Would CONGRESS have been better if Govt had stayed out of free market ? 
9256	1998	If they HAD , maybe there would NOT have even been recession . 
9257	1998	You want proof that YOU 're drinking liberal kool-ade and that stimulus has failed ? 
9258	1998	Look to politicians feeding YOU that ASPECT_KOOL-ADE . 
9259	1998	Are politicians running for re-election on merits of obamacare ? 
9261	1998	Are politicians running on great jobs reports ? 
9263	1998	Are politicians running on great stimulus plan ? 
9265	1998	politicians campaigns are one and one only . 
9266	1998	ASPECT_F ASPECT_& ASPECT_F opponent is worse than F&F . 
9267	1998	NOT how good f & f 've done , instead , ASPECT_F ASPECT_& ASPECT_F opponent will be even worse ! 
9268	1998	Ca n't YOU read between lines of what YOU own liberal politicians are saying ? 
9269	1998	POLITICIANS 're saying , pooch is screwed , and YOU ca n't hear POLITICIANS because YOU ears are full of ASPECT_KOOL-ADE . 
9270	1999	brain washing going on here has convinced you that fairy tales about free market are in fact accurate . 
9271	1999	Government is not answer to problems , you are right . 
9272	1999	Unfortunately for narrative you are trying to convince us of , government at times actually IS answer . 
9273	1999	No one believes government should solve problems , or even problems , is straw man invented believers in laissez faire fairy tale . 
9274	1999	reality is , government did play role in current economic crisis , but reality is also that market did as well . 
9275	1999	Government did keep interest rates too low , but BELIEVERS also deregulated whole industry -LRB- means less government , not -RRB- , and market failed . 
9276	1999	Banks did act incompetently . 
9277	1999	BELIEVERS did , when given freedom , cause massive problem . 
9278	1999	is true of consumers of housing . 
9279	1999	People bought houses people could n't afford , not because government made PEOPLE , but because PEOPLE made irrational decisions . 
9280	1999	Irrational decisions are not taken into account in laissez faire fairy tale story . 
9281	1999	Nor are market failures , externalities , etc. . 
9281	1999	But is problem of us are able to see problems government solves and problems problem creates . 
9282	1999	ASPECT_US do n't need black and white world where is problem and is solution . 
9283	1999	Not when reality is that sometimes IS problem , but SOLUTION is also sometimes solution . 
9284	1999	Just like is sometimes solution , but SOLUTION can also be problem as well . 
9285	1999	is reality of market -LRB- I do n't call SOLUTION free market , as is mythical concept made up in laissez faire fairy tales . 
9286	1999	SOLUTION is sort of like unicorn -rrb- , SOLUTION can do things extraordinarily well , but can not do others things as well . 
9287	1999	Government is . 
9288	1999	But takes level of nuance and recognition of complexity that too are incapable of recognizing . 
9289	1999	I really do tire of simplistic arguments where either government is source of problems , or greedy corporations are source of problems . 
9290	1999	reality is CORPORATIONS are both capable of doing good things as well as bad . 
9291	2000	No , just like I dont let I dog soil I carpet ... 
9292	2001	Is meant to be folksy home truth offers simple insight into issue at hand ? 
9293	2001	If is , please explain what in world you are talking about , because at moment MOMENT makes no sense to me , and just seems like nonsensical gibberish . 
9294	2002	In words , no I am not voting for I ! 
9296	2003	-LRB- giggles -RRB- pragmatist ears are full of Kool-Ade ? 
9297	2003	ASPECT_DAN , PRAGMATIST think your metaphor has kinda derailed here . 
9298	2003	Look , like PRAGMATIST 've said before , PRAGMATIST 'm pragmatist - PRAGMATIST go with what works , and PRAGMATIST go where evidence leads PRAGMATIST . 
9299	2003	If you want to convince PRAGMATIST of your position , then show pragmatist evidence . 
9300	2003	Or thorough argument . 
9301	2003	Or 's reason to think . 
9302	2003	Just saying government is evil and always problem over and over is n't going to cut PROBLEM , you need to show how and why government is problem . 
9303	2003	No one is saying that market is evil or needs to be done away with or source of but problems . 
9304	2003	Well , at least not with ounce of sense . 
9305	2003	free market is extraordinarily powerful engine for creating material wealth . 
9306	2003	But 's really ENGINE does . 
9307	2003	As PRAGMATIST 've previously pointed out , market left to previously devices can create pretty bad situations . 
9308	2003	previously needs to be balanced with institutions . 
9309	2003	does n't necessarily need to be government , but at least so far , government has been effective -LRB- if very imperfect -RRB- tool for doing . 
9310	2003	If you have better suggestion , please share suggestion . 
9311	2003	PRAGMATIST am not especially interested in laying blame for recession . 
9312	2003	PRAGMATIST 'm much more interested in figuring out what to do now . 
9313	2003	PRAGMATIST agree completely that seeds of recession go way back , and hands helped plant them . 
9314	2003	But does n't help us find way out of WAY now . 
9315	2003	As PRAGMATIST said before , fiscal stimulus is about tool available to President and ASPECT_CONGRESS to fight recession . 
9316	2003	If you have suggestion for to try , please share that too . 
9317	2003	In general , PRAGMATIST believe in balanced budgets , and do n't like deficit spending . 
9318	2003	But there are times when deficits are both appropriate and necessary . 
9319	2003	Just like you should generally keep your family budget balanced , but sometimes you need to borrow because of unusual circumstances . 
9320	2003	family emergency , accident or unforeseen expense not covered by insurance , etc. . 
9321	2003	comparison between presidents ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_OBAMA is not about how big deficits are , but what 're being run up for . 
9322	2003	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_BUSH ran up recurring structural deficit during time of prosperity primarily to fund ASPECT_TAX_CUT for top earners . 
9323	2003	would be sort of like quitting your well paying full time career and instead taking part time job , without changing your spending . 
9324	2003	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA , on hand , has run up deficit with emergency , limited spending to deal with current crisis . 
9325	2003	is analogous to if you had fire in your house , and your insurance did n't give you enough coverage to fix everything , so you take out loan to get things back to how earners should be . 
9326	2003	PRAGMATIST do n't like bailouts then you do , but EARNERS are necessary . 
9327	2003	Just look at damage letting lehman brothers fail caused . 
9328	2003	What would have happened if we 'd allowed , what was DAMAGE ? 
9329	2003	like dozen major companies ? 
9330	2003	What if WE 'd let of them fail at time ? 
9331	2003	Sometimes life does n't give you good options , and you have to choose least bad one . 
9332	2003	Surely you ran into situations like that running your business , when you had to make hard choice between lesser of two evils ? 
9333	2003	Yes , stimulus has worked , just not enough . 
9334	2003	We 've been over at length already , do PRAGMATIST need to go over ASPECT_CBO_REPORT , unemployment and ASPECT_GDP_FIGURE , independent economic analyzes , surveys of economists , and of again \* ? 
9335	2003	will be , what , fourth time now ? 
9336	2003	like . 
9337	2003	You had no answer to evidence before , do you have one now ? 
9338	2003	As for way democrats are running campaigns year , PRAGMATIST have to admit PRAGMATIST am completely mystified . 
9339	2003	But then political campaigns are often not governed by reason and facts ... 
9340	2004	I 'm not much for laying blame either . 
9341	2004	But in case , blame is on `` GOVT , people you hope will fix WHAT THEY BROKE ! 
9342	2004	Not democrats , Not republicans , not liberals , not conservatives -------- POLITICIANS of both parties caused recession , unknowingly , and have no knowledge of how to fix -------- . 
9343	2004	Over and over , and over again , my post like liberal opinions ARE FACTS , OVER are not facts same as my posting are n't facts unless I can point to proof . 
9344	2004	You say Stimulus HAS worked , just not enough . 
9345	2004	is FAILURE . 
9346	2004	is rewarding of mediocre as liberals are wont to do . 
9347	2004	TRYING is just trying . 
9348	2004	DOING is accomplishment . 
9349	2004	What happens if company fails or company fails ? 
9350	2004	SOMETHING takes place . 
9351	2004	is free market . 
9352	2004	obamalama said ASPECT_GM must not fail , Many of your ` esteemed ' economists said ASPECT_GM must not fail . 
9353	2004	ASPECT_GM did fail and is still unconstitutional government manufacturing company . 
9354	2004	In process of becoming govt manufacturing co. , `` GOVT , violated long existing bankruptcy laws as were inconvenient to Govt . 
9355	2004	Bond holders got screwed , taxpayer got screwed , and ASPECT_GM was GIFTED to ASPECT_UAW in exchange for votes . 
9356	2004	And `` GOVT that you place so faith in , sweetened pot for ASPECT_UAW and ASPECT_GIFTED 60 billion in cash in addition to bailout billions . 
9357	2004	Then wonderful govt claims that ASPECT_GM paid back of bailout . 
9358	2004	Yes BILLIONS did , BILLIONS paid GOVT back with part of 60 billion in WORTHLESS stock `` GOVT purchased for ASPECT_GM . 
9359	2004	stock presently worth 00.75 , IF STOCK were traded . 
9360	2004	AND IS fact !! 
9361	2004	AND `` GOVT , gave chrysler to ASPECT_FIAT . 
9362	2004	Someday we will learn why , other than somehow helping ASPECT_UAW . 
9363	2004	How do you REFUSE to see ? 
9364	2004	There is much , much more . 
9365	2005	I would never buy car was Government owned , I wont give reasons why ... But I think Republic is smart enough to know ... 
9366	2006	Translation : ASPECT_JLB is far too smart for me . 
9367	2006	ME tried tangling with him , and HIM handed me me ass . 
9368	2006	ME intend to stay on porch and not run with big dogs , and ME suggest you do . 
9371	2009	Thanks for input . 
9372	2011	You would , would n't you ? 
9373	2011	Or at least stop making predictions ... I guess people never learn . 
9374	2012	ASPECT_DAN , breaking economy and fixing ECONOMY are two different things . 
9375	2012	While what was done wrong to get us here is important to learn from in making decisions in future , giving economy boost now is ASPECT_US know how to do . 
9376	2012	Fiscal stimulus has been being used successfully by administrations of both parties since Great depression . 
9377	2012	And as I 've already shown , there is ample evidence that stimulus has \* helped economy . 
9378	2012	You insist on clinging to sliver of uncertainty inherent in everything in life just because you do n't like where evidence leads . 
9379	2012	's your privilege , of course , but you ca n't expect else to pay attention to you if 's what you choose to do . 
9380	2012	If you hit nail with hammer , and nail is only driven partway in , do you declare hammer failure and toss HAMMER away , or do you hit nail again ? 
9381	2012	If one company is going under , then sure , let market do MARKET , even if MARKET really big one . 
9382	2012	But if there are lot of companies going under at time ? 
9383	2012	As thought experiment , consider extreme case - if company in country failed at time . 
9384	2012	DISASTER would be disaster , right ? 
9385	2012	company fails represents hit to economy . 
9386	2012	Individually , failure is small enough that economy as whole can handle ECONOMY . 
9387	2012	But if you get too much at one time , especially if economy is already weak , TIME can cause problem . 
9388	2012	economy is resilient and can take lot of punishment , but there is limit . 
9389	2014	You present `` Doomsday scenario , and of course , result would be Doomsday , SURPRISE . 
9390	2014	idea of bailing out wall street was to ease credit crunch . 
9391	2014	They took money and kept MONEY and now report record profits , while not easing credit at . 
9392	2014	How would have failed ? 
9393	2014	YOU DO not know and DOOMSDAY do n't know and obamalama does n't know . 
9394	2014	But money sure looks like crooked but not so smart politicians got hosed by crooked but smarter businessmen . 
9395	2015	I can see you ca n't stop thinking about I ... 
9396	2016	ASPECT_BURGER_KING is hiring . 
9397	2016	would suit your capacity very well . 
9398	2016	Be that you can be . 
9399	2017	FIRMS only meant it as thought experiment to point out that if lot of companies fail at once , would have larger implications beyond just companies . 
9400	2017	Obviously FIRMS 'm not suggesting that there 's possibility that company in country could actually fail at time , 's rather silly scenario if taken literally . 
9401	2017	No , nobody knows how would have failed if government had done . 
9402	2017	But we do know that lehman brothers did \* fail , and had major repercussions for economy , and helped push WE into recession . 
9403	2017	And WE do know that quite financial firms were also in trouble at time . 
9404	2017	Would SCENARIO really have been worth risk to do ? 
9405	2017	And FIRMS 'm no happier about behavior of lot of firms after got ASPECT_BAILOUT_MONEY then you are , but what can WE do ? 
9406	2017	Should ASPECT_CONGRESS try to pass law to make do right ? 
9407	2017	Of ASPECT_COURSE_NOT , talk about government intruding on market , and COURSE probably would n't work anyway . 
9408	2017	So choice we have is , do WE hold we noses and help bunch of undeserving schmucks solely because 've managed to worm way into important positions , or do WE let go down and take risk 'll take rest of down with ? 
9409	2017	Besides , lot of tarp money has been paid back , and FIRMS believe program is actually expected to turn nice profit for taxpayer when is said and done . 
9410	2017	As for stimulus ... If time you hit nail time driven in just ASPECT_TINY_BIT , even if AMOUNT microscopic amount , after trillion hits you 'll have moved nail appreciably , even if TIME 's not been driven way home yet . 
9411	2017	Besides , what are you going to do if you toss hammer aside ? 
9412	2017	Try to drive in nail with your mind ? 
9413	2017	-LRB- j\/k -RRB- We 've gone from major recession with shrinking economy shedding jobs at breathtaking rate to stagnant economy with stable yet unacceptably ASPECT_HIGH_UNEMPLOYMENT . 
9414	2017	is progress , even if WE still have way to go yet . 
9415	2017	And there is plenty of evidence , as FIRMS 've shown , that stimulus helped . 
9416	2017	When PLENTY comes to campaign ... -LRB- shrugs -RRB- What can FIRMS say ? 
9417	2017	Democrats are bunch of wimps ? 
9418	2017	FIRMS really do n't know what 's going on with them . 
9419	2017	FIRMS 've heard talking heads on TV speculate that people running campaigns think that , `` FIRMS may be bad , but FIRMS would have been lot worse if FIRMS 'd done , is too complicated argument to get across in campaign . 
9420	2017	FIRMS 've no idea if PEOPLE had idea what people were talking about or not . 
9421	2017	It seems like ASPECT_DEMOCRATS lost spin war and just kinda gave up . 
9422	2017	Do n't ask FIRMS why . 
9423	2017	WAR seems to FIRMS -LRB- yes , is purely FIRMS impression -RRB- that people are upset about economy and scared for people future . 
9424	2017	Which is , of course , completely understandable and justified . 
9425	2017	But lot of times people who are scared and upset react more emotionally , maybe Dems are afraid that people are too emotional right now to listen to facts and figures ? 
9426	2017	FIRMS really do n't know , FIRMS 'm purely speculating here . 
9427	2018	They have you thoroughly and completely brainwashed . 
9428	2018	ASPECT_LIBERAL ASPECT_PARTY line , public is confused , public is scared , public is emotional . 
9429	2018	And here you are , insulting us just like your masters do . 
9430	2018	ASPECT_US are not confused , ASPECT_US know what is going on . 
9431	2018	ASPECT_US are not afraid . 
9432	2018	ASPECT_US are bit emotional , PISSED about being talked down to by incompetent idiot whose strings are being pulled by ASPECT_SOROS , pissed about being insulted , pissed about being told ASPECT_US do n't know what ASPECT_US 're doing , and pissed about bastardization of ASPECT_AMERICAN_DREAM . 
9433	2018	And pissed about Communist idea of `` redistribution of wealth . 
9434	2018	And pissed about ruinous wasteful spending with NO plan to pay AND back . 
9435	2018	Pissed about string of lies , bribes , earmarks , and technicalities used to pass health-care insurance bill up to 70 of nation does not want . 
9436	2018	So yes we are emotional to get puppet clown out of power and then out of office . 
9437	2019	I 'm sorry if what I said sounded condescending or insulting , was n't I intent at . 
9438	2019	So please accept I apology , I retract what I said about IDEA . 
9439	2019	However , I do question whether IDEA 's good idea to judge what 's going on in world based on what politicians say , especially politicians running for office . 
9440	2019	Wait minute ASPECT_DAN , that almost sounds like you 're complaining about government not ASPECT_SPENDING_MONEY . 
9441	2019	LOL Is n't LOL good if took less money to deal with problem then was originally thought ? 
9442	2019	I do n't know for sure how much , if , of ASPECT_BAILOUT_MONEY has been paid back , and I do n't really want to argue about . 
9443	2019	-LRB- To be honest , I just do n't feel like doing work to come up with hard numbers . -RRB- 
9444	2019	's not really point . 
9445	2019	TARP was designed to keep financial system from completely collapsing , which SYSTEM did . 
9446	2019	Do you think liberals wanted to bail out ASPECT_WALL_STREET ? 
9447	2019	We had to do STREET because danger of severe damage to economy was too great . 
9448	2019	Besides , ASPECT_DAN , what would you be saying now about government incompetence if bailouts had n't happened , and NOW had dropped floor out from under economy ? 
9449	2020	Once again , unrelentingly , you present opinions as facts . 
9450	2020	floor did drop out of economy . 
9451	2020	Would FLOOR have been worse , or not ? 
9452	2020	We do not know . 
9453	2020	But WE do know that problems WERE caused by politicians . 
9454	2020	To push politicians to side and LET FREE market work , could have been wiser to do . 
9455	2020	But while there is no proof of , neither is there proof that letting people caused problems continue to manipulate free market to POLITICIANS ends was wise either . 
9456	2020	WE ARE where WE are now . 
9457	2020	And people in power now have had and do have but one single plan . 
9458	2020	BORROW , spend borrowed money ! 
9459	2020	Sorry that you are unable to realize that majority of Americans do not agree with `` plan . 
9460	2020	`` from liberal site :10 \ \/ 04\/2010the federal government &#8217; s unpopular &#8211; and often vilified &#8212; 700 billion bailout program officially came to end when clock struck midnight early Monday morning . 
9461	2020	Troubled Asset Relief program &#8217; s -LRB- tarp -rrb- formal sunset date means that no ASPECT_NEW_PROGRAM will be funded under initiative and no money will be doled out to prop up ailing banks , although existing programs &#8211; such as government &#8217; s foreclosure prevention efforts &#8211; will continue to run s course with money that &#8217; s already been allotted . 
9462	2020	Capitalists , tax-paying americans , and even lawmakers who voted for bill made tarp possible two yearsago to day have criticized government &#8217; s massive intervention in financial system . 
9463	2020	Initially , monumental rescue effort was expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars &#8211; figure prompted outcries and protests across nation . 
9464	2020	But with banks now turning profit and repaying TAXPAYERS tarp dollars , and even automakers and insurance giant aig expected to be able to pay back at least part of taxpayers capital injections , program &#8217; s price tag has shrunk to fraction of . 
9465	2020	latest reports on treasury &#8217; s estimates put cost of TARP at less than 50 billion . 
9466	2020	officials have even gone so far as to say OFFICIALS expect government &#8217; s bailout efforts to actually turn profit for taxpayers when is said and done . 
9467	2020	Numbers released by ASPECT_CONGRESSIONAL ASPECT_BUDGET office -LRB- cbo -rrb- in August are not too far off from treasury &#8217; s figures . 
9468	2020	ASPECT_CBO &#8217; s assessment is that TARP will carry expense of 66 billion . 
9469	2020	ASPECT_TREASURY says 50 billion , ASPECT_CBO says 66 billion , liberal writer says , `` not too far off .

9473	2024	You 've made lot of assertions . 
9474	2024	However , you have provided zero in way of supporting facts . 
9475	2025	I dont eat raw meat , and I wont vote for ASPECT_OBAMA_EITHER ... Jollee 
9476	2026	-LRB- quote = dan40 ; 3076858 -rrb- More of ` standard ' liberal game plan , `` Always attempt to twist conservatives words to mean what you know 100 they did not mean . 
9477	2026	-LRB- quote -RRB- Take DAN40 easy , ASPECT_DAN , was meant as purely humorous remark . 
9478	2026	You 'll note LOL on end ? 
9479	2026	And once again , unrelentingly , you try to avoid reality by calling ONCE opinion and pretending makes ONCE equally valid to claim that stimulus hurt economy . 
9480	2026	makes as sense as saying that idea of round earth is opinion -LRB- which ONCE is -RRB- and therefore it is equally valid to say that ASPECT_EARTH is flat . 
9481	2026	Why are you so determined to cling to idea that both evidence and your theory says is wrong ? 
9482	2026	37 of stimulus was ASPECT_TAX_BREAK , and YOU have yet to hear claim that ASPECT_TAX_CUT do n't stimulate economy . 
9483	2026	YOU 've repeatedly challenged you to come up with single shred of evidence says stimulus did n't help economy and you 've repeatedly utterly and completely failed . 
9484	2026	In case , are you seriously suggesting that if financial sector had completely collapsed that things would n't have been much , much worse ? 
9485	2026	As in Great Depression levels of worse ? 
9486	2026	Is 100 absolutely certain ? 
9487	2026	Of ASPECT_COURSE_NOT , in life is . 
9488	2026	COURSE 's not 100 absolutely certain sun will rise in east tomorrow morning . 
9489	2026	Yes , politicians are human and fallible , and yes ONES do n't entirely know what ONES 're doing . 
9490	2026	Just like everyone else in world . 
9491	2026	Here 's ASPECT_NEWS_FLASH for EVERYONE , ASPECT_DAN , free market is made up of humans who are just as fallible and just as often do n't know what ONES 're doing . 
9492	2026	Nobody forced banks to make ASPECT_SUBPRIME_MORTGAGE , nobody forced banks to encourage people to borrow more then PEOPLE could afford , and no one forced PEOPLE to bundle bad debts as derivatives have lead to so grief . 
9493	2026	politicians bear lot of blame for getting us where ASPECT_US are . 
9494	2026	So does market . 
9495	2026	Your argument about `` Why should your trust politicians to get YOUR out of mess when ONES 're ones who got YOUR in MESS , can just as easily be applied to market . 
9496	2026	There is no one single villain in story , and there 's no single quick fix , either . 
9497	2026	And as for 16,000,000,000.00 , you seem to have no sense of scale when SENSE comes to money . 
9498	2026	that sum can just as easily be expressed as 0.016 petadollars or as 1,600,000,000,000,000 millicents . 
9499	2026	So what ? 
9500	2026	Changing units and moving decimal point to make look bigger or smaller is silly tactic . 
9501	2026	difference between 50 and 66 is not huge , especially when you 're talking about estimates of there is lot of uncertainty about . 
9502	2026	Even if DIFFERENCE is in billions of dollars . 
9503	2027	Ummm ... say what ... ?!?!?! 
9504	2028	statement is perfectly coherent . 
9505	2028	You need to read STATEMENT again . 
9506	2029	And , as is normally case with liberal meme , CASE is completely divorced from reality . 
9507	2030	Is it ? 
9508	2030	And as is normally case with right wing meme , CASE is completely divorced from truth . 
9509	2030	No one did force banks to do things . 
9510	2030	So what exactly was objectionable about statement , other than it was reality which clashed with your preconceived notions . 
9511	2031	fact that statement was about as divorced from reality as STATEMENT could get . 
9512	2031	Of course , you live in opposite world , so we do n't expect you to understand . 
9513	2031	Banks were indeed pressured into giving low income -LRB- read sub-prime -rrb- loans . 
9514	2031	People were widely encouraged to enter into home ownership , despite fact that PEOPLE could not afford OWNERSHIP , and it was GSEs , through government pressure , started practice of sub-prime bundling . 
9515	2031	So yeah ... What SUB-PRIME said was true , if by `` true you mean `` completely false . 
9516	2032	Almost everything THEY say here is easily disproven lie . 
9518	2032	No they were n't . 
9519	2032	government was involved in subprime industry , but 85 of ASPECT_SUBPRIME_MORTGAGE were issues by private industries . 
9520	2032	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.mcclatchydc.com \ \/ 2008\/10\/1 ... ixzz12xTyWY91AI suggest you read as well .

9521	2032	. 
9521	2032	articleid = 1812The reality is , largest role government played in creation and collapse of ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE , was keeping interests far too low for far too long . 
9522	2032	Not fannie and freddy , nor government forcing banks to give loans -LRB- reality did n't happen -RRB- , etc. securitization of debt was also not forced on banks by government . 
9523	2032	GOVERNMENT has history , and I can not imagine where you came up with idea that IDEA was forced onto by banks -LRB- for future reference , FUTURE is best to provide links to support absurd claims -RRB- . 
9524	2032	Read up bit on GOVERNMENT history . 
9525	2032	http : \ \/ \ \/ en.wikipedia.org \ \/ wiki\/securitizationsubprime bundling is 100 phenomenon of private institutions . 
9526	2032	You really need to either educate yourself and read up on issues , or stop reading dishonest sources that lie and distort facts . 
9527	2032	reality is government certainly had role to play in causing crisis , but they were not catalyst , nor main catalyst . 
9528	2032	There is plenty of blame to share between government , banks , and people who took out debt they could n't possible service . 
9529	2032	Your schewed dishonest partisan view of issue , means it is best not to make declarative statements , because when VIEW comes to issue , you do n't know what you are talking about . 
9530	2033	government was initial mover of sub-prime loans . 
9531	2033	ONES were ones initially pushed banks into issuing loans , and , because loans were so risky , ONES pushed GSEs into bundling ONES to mitigate risk . 
9532	2033	No one in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR wanted to touch market , originally . 
9533	2033	It was GSEs , with ones wink and nod hint that bundles would be insured by government against loss , spurred initial private investor involvement . 
9534	2033	truth at to your words is that ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR and wall street investors were deeply involved by time SECTOR crashed . 
9535	2033	TRUTH had taken life of TRUTH in private markets , leaving GSEs with less than half of bundling . 
9536	2033	But INVOLVEMENT was government involvement in markets got ball rolling , in place . 
9537	2035	Sometimes ASPECT_DAN seems to have bit of tendency to sound like government is always cause of problems , and letting free market operate unfettered is solution to everything . 
9538	2035	My point was simply that mess we find WE in was not caused simply by ASPECT_WASHINGTON ordering banks and institutions to make unwise financial decisions . 
9539	2035	Bad policy decisions in government certainly played role , but decisions made in ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR were big big factor in causing recession . 
9540	2035	Just pointing out there 's plenty of blame to go around . 
9541	2035	Like ASPECT_ALAN ASPECT_GREENSPAN said about behavior of mortgage lenders , of WE who have looked to self-interest of ASPECT_LENDING_INSTITUTION to protect shareholders equity , MY included , are in state of shocked disbelief . 
9543	2037	Still using ny times liberal propaganda machine as source ? 
9544	2037	ASPECT_NYT long ago stopped paying attention to TRUTH . 
9545	2037	Use better , less biased sources . 
9546	2037	You do not see me using ASPECT_FOX news as source for reason . 
9547	2037	Is Govt strictly to blame ? 
9548	2037	VERY nearly . 
9549	2037	Yes ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR did jump in and take full advantage of license to steal that Govt gave them . 
9550	2037	Should come as surprise ? 
9551	2037	Had govt not created atmosphere and opportunity for near illegal ASPECT_BUSINESS_PRACTICE , ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR would not have been able to take advantage of situation did not exist . 
9552	2037	Being old fart that ME am , ME remember days when bankers were cautious business people around . 
9553	2037	old joke was to get loan , you had to prove to banker that you absolutely did not need money ! 
9554	2037	If you did not have 20 down and excellent credit and good and permanent job , RENT . 
9555	2037	Because you would not get loan . 
9556	2037	Bankers had no intention of changing people attitudes and practices , Govt insisted that had right to own house whether PEOPLE could afford HOUSE or not . 
9557	2037	As totally stupid as sounds , elected representatives actually said things . 
9558	2037	And REQUIRED that bankers act toward end . 
9559	2037	Do you leave your car running with doors and windows open and keys in CAR , parked on downtown street while you go shopping ? 
9560	2037	NO , you do n't . 
9561	2037	But is what Govt did with mortgage and financial industries . 
9562	2037	Yes ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR still had to be dishonest and drive away in car , so they are not blameless . 
9563	2037	ME know ME to be absolutely honest , but ME 've never been tempted with BILLIONS with no fear of prosecution . 
9564	2039	Well , would be one of my problems with ASPECT_GREENSPAN . 
9565	2039	Because once government implied that would back bundles against loss , even though it was n't supposed to be true , ONCE opened door to full fledged involvement of markets . 
9566	2039	Of course , ONCE was reckless , but were doing what government wanted to do . 
9567	2039	lot of people saw problem develop and tried to put stop to STOP . 
9568	2039	Sad that ASPECT_GREENSPAN was astonished by LOT . 
9569	2039	self-interest of ASPECT_LENDING_INSTITUTION had government interest of pushing sub-prime loans super-imposed on top of SELF-INTEREST . 
9570	2039	What really galls me is to see ASPECT_OBAMA , of people , wag ASPECT_OBAMA_FINGER at banks , as if ASPECT_OBAMA had no ASPECT_PERSONAL_INVOLVEMENT in mess . 
9571	2039	And now , we 're supposed to forget what started NOW , and accept ASPECT_OBAMA tired analogy of Republicans driving car into ditch . 
9572	2039	NOW 's quite ridiculous . 
9573	2040	Your logic is completely flawed . 
9574	2040	If not for government , environment to do sorts of things would have happened naturally . 
9575	2040	With no restrictions in place , THINKERS would have done . 
9576	2040	Without restriction , license to steal exists naturally , only curbed by others ability to use force to protect thinkers assets . 
9577	2040	government never required banks to do what THINKERS did . 
9578	2040	THINKERS did NEVER because THINKERS were short term thinkers who ignored term consequences of thinkers actions , in order to gain short ASPECT_TERM_BENEFIT . 
9579	2040	has to do with government , and everything to do with modern business environment . 
9580	2040	assumption that underlies right wing economic thought is that we assume rational actors . 
9581	2040	reality is , assumption can not accurately be made . 
9582	2040	People actions are far too often irrational to make assumption . 
9583	2040	irrationality of actions of bankers and people taking loans , combined with artificially low interest rates -LRB- idea advanced by friedman -rrb- , created mess . 
9584	2040	So government had role to play , but to say very nearly blame lies with government is beyond absurd . 
9585	2041	Oh , for crying out loud , ASPECT_DAN , dan was only citing ASPECT_NY_TIME to source greenspan quote , and DAN only used that because it was source google found for ASPECT_DAN . 
9586	2041	Since there 's no dispute about what ASPECT_GREENSPAN said , ASPECT_DAN did n't feel need to wade through minutes of ASPECT_CONGRESSIONAL hearing greenspan said CONGRESSIONAL at . 
9587	2041	: PAnd do n't ASPECT_GREENSPAN see irony of accusing government of encouraging `` near illegal ASPECT_BUSINESS_PRACTICE considering DISPUTE government actions make illegal practices illegal in place ? 
9588	2041	Errr , what ASPECT_PERSONAL_INVOLVEMENT ? 
9589	2041	ASPECT_OBAMA was strictly ASPECT_PRIVATE_CITIZEN before jan 2005 , and not involved in financial sector at . 
9590	2041	And while ASPECT_DAN 'm certainly not expert , ASPECT_DAN do n't recall important financial legislation going through ASPECT_SENATE between then and jan 2009 . 
9591	2041	Unless can correct ASPECT_DAN on ? 
9592	2042	I certainly can . 
9593	2042	Although senators and representatives had deeper involvement with blocking meaningful reform at GSEs , ASPECT_OBAMA himself was one of top five recipients of funds from GSEs during ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM as Senator . 
9594	2042	During time , ASPECT_SENATE bill 190 was released from committee favorably to floor , but was never brought to debate because Democrats made bill very clear that SENATORS were in lockstep opposition to OPPOSITION , and Republicans did not have enough votes to push for TIME on SENATORS . 
9595	2042	ASPECT_OBAMA was one of Senators . 
9596	2042	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.govtrack.us \ \/ users\/questio ... = bill : s109-190This is bill ASPECT_MCCAIN unsuccessfully sought to revive during election , and ASPECT_OBAMA refused to do so , even though , by then , problem was VERY apparent to was paying attention to PROBLEM , and had grown far worse even just since bill was first released from committee . 
9597	2042	Now , does to say that ASPECT_OBAMA was anywhere near as involved as certain others , especially ASPECT_DODD , who had so involvement with housing crash ASPECT_OBAMA literally retired at end of ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM . 
9598	2042	But ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_OBAMA current rhetoric on causes of ASPECT_ECONOMIC_SITUATION simply flies in face of reality , and ASPECT_OBAMA is far more culpable for situation than ASPECT_OBAMA would like to believe .

9634	2052	And even if you chose not to believe that , you could throw out life work of guys and there would still be mountain of evidence saying that climate change is real and CHANGE is happening . 
9635	2052	In cases literal mountains - alpine glaciers have been retreating dramatically around world for decades . 
9636	2052	You have historical climate records of century or two , ice cores from ASPECT_GREENLAND , ASPECT_ANTARCTICA , and alpine glaciers from around world , tree ring data from around world , lake and ocean sediment evidence from around world - of which point to : co2 levels in atmosphere have spiked and temperatures are rising dramatically . 
9637	2052	debate now is about how bad effects are really going to be , and how we can and should do about DEBATE . 
9638	2052	And even if you still insist on denying climate change , how can you seriously argue that getting off of fossil fuels , particularly oil , is important and urgent priority ? 
9639	2052	Being depending on oil imports form ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST has big and obvious political and economic effects . 
9640	2052	And WE 've hit peak oil - even with improving technology amount of oil produced is going to start inexorable decline from now on . 
9641	2052	plus surging demand for oil from rapidly developing parts of world like ASPECT_INDIA and ASPECT_CHINA ... supply and demand , ? 
9642	2052	And before you start saying that market will take care of MARKET ... WE 've known since 70 that WE need to get off of oil , and what has ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR done about MARKET ? 
9643	2052	Not . 
9644	2052	WE 've been sitting on we thumbs for decades . 
9645	2052	Brazilians , for example , have not . 
9646	2052	They decided after oil shocks of 70 that THEY were going to be energy independent , and guess what ? 
9647	2052	THEY are . 
9648	2052	Thanks to determined action , brazilian economy mostly runs on home grown sugar cane ethanol - THEY import virtually no oil at all . 
9649	2052	oil prices are going to start going up inexorably from now on , 's just fact of life . 
9650	2052	If rise is gradual , sure , then market will be able to deal with RISE . 
9651	2052	But what if RISE 's not gradual ? 
9652	2052	We saw just years ago that prices can spike dramatically in very short amount of time , even without things like terrorism or international politics getting involved . 
9653	2052	What if oil prices double in month - for several months in row ? 
9654	2052	Is that risk worth taking ? 
9655	2053	Once again you do ONCE . 
9656	2053	There are 2 paragraphs highlighted . 
9657	2053	You pick onlt and then drone on and on with opinion stated as fact . 
9658	2053	Your unceasing habit . 
9659	2053	You believe Climate change to be reality , but no FACTUAL reality has been proven . 
9660	2053	I 'm not saying CHANGE is not real , I 'm very doubtful as climate does fluctuate , but I do n't know either way . 
9661	2053	But you ignored second and important paragraph . 
9662	2053	If BHO IS deeply involved in CCX , then ASPECT_BHO serves bho bank account when talking about energy bills , not ASPECT_USA . 
9663	2054	And once again you do ONCE , trying to ignore inconvenient facts by labeling them as opinions . 
9664	2054	ONCE is fact that evidence for anthropogenic climate change is overwhelming , not opinion , and even cursory research would tell you that . 
9665	2054	And you completely ignore fact that concrete goal of cap and trade is to get us off of fossil fuels . 
9666	2054	But , since you want me to directly address ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA ASPECT_PERSONAL_INVOLVEMENT in CCX , let review : Noungrant -LRB- plural grants -RRB- 1 . 
9667	2054	act of granting ; bestowing or conferring ; concession ; allowance ; permission .2 . 
9668	2054	yielding or admission of in dispute .3 . 
9669	2054	or property granted ; gift ; boon .4 . 
9670	2054	transfer of property by deed or writing ; especially , au appropriation or conveyance made by government ; as , grant of land or of money ; also , deed or writing by which transfer is made . 
9671	2054	Nounfoundation -LRB- plural foundations -rrb- 4 . 
9672	2054	donation or legacy appropriated to support charitable institution , and constituting permanent fund ; endowment .5 . 
9673	2054	which is founded , or established by endowment ; endowed institution or charity . 
9674	2054	You will note distinct lack of words like `` loan `` investment or `` repayment in definitions . 
9675	2054	How then does ASPECT_JOYCE_FOUNDATION have financial interest in worth of CCX ? 
9676	2054	And even if they did , how would financially benefit ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA ? 
9677	2054	Being former board member does not give MEMBER financial stake in FOUNDATION . 
9678	2054	And even if MEMBER did have sort of investment in STAKE , which ME do n't think is even possible with charitable foundation , ASPECT_OBAMA assets have been put in blind trust , like Presidents . 
9679	2054	So , ASPECT_DAN , ME 'm afraid your logic fails not once , not twice , but three times . 
9680	2055	Naive , to infinity . 
9681	2055	CCX is not charitable foundation . 
9682	2056	Nooooo , but ASPECT_JOYCE_FOUNDATION is . 
9683	2056	And you still have three gaps in your argument to bridge . 
9684	2057	Not too take out newspaper adds of corruption . 
9685	2057	do n't want you liberals looking too foolish . 
9686	2059	You must be independently wealthy ! 
9687	2059	You are not seeing what citizens see ! 
9690	2063	LEARN TO SPELL !! 
9691	2063	Please - use frickin ' dictionary - you might do better in your business . 
9692	2064	hAAAAA , learn too get GOOD job , YOU PROBABLY dont need one but i do , my emolyees DO ok your just DIFFERENT bird !

9696	2065	DONT let get you DOWN ! 
9697	2065	jollee keep funny up , YOU ARE INTELLEGENT ! 
9699	2067	IF I HAD CERTAINITY IN ECONOMY , I WOULD not hire YOU ... employees like family ... OUR PAY FOR glasses cousins operation , DAUGHTERS leg brace etc. ... YOU ARE ONE WHO would not BE CONSIDERED PART OF business family ... YOU WOULD NEVER BE HIRED , too protect family NOW , we can not hire ! 
9700	2067	we protect twenty five employees salary , YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO NONE ! 
9701	2067	your employmenship would BE CONSIDERED LOOSER ! 
9703	2069	Love your philosophy , PHILOSOPHY shame really ... 
9704	2070	Climate change !!!!!!!!!!! 
9705	2070	Now I 'm more than bit older than you , but still I 've been around for well less than century . 
9706	2070	mere 70 years . 
9707	2070	In time I 've lived thru : cold period in general warming trend . 
9708	2070	warming period in general cooling trend . 
9709	2070	very warm period of general warming trend . 
9710	2070	very cold period of general cooling trend . 
9711	2070	Stable periods in generally unstable climate . 
9712	2070	Unstable periods in generally stable climate . 
9713	2070	of above have been `` official decrees by learned people that study climatic events . 
9714	2070	of above are not possible in one short lifetime , yet people have been official proclamations . 
9715	2070	Now we are told that WE have warmed up small part of DEGREE since 1900 . 
9716	2070	Less than one half of one degree warmer now than HALF was 110 years ago . 
9717	2070	In order for to be true , WE must assume that temperature recordings in 1900 were accurate to within less than one half of one degree . 
9718	2070	So do you BELIEVE temp recordings 110 years ago were accurate to within 100 to 99.75 I have very serious doubts that they were . 
9719	2071	Well , in order to decide what to make of like changing pronouncements on where climate is going , CLIMATE helps to understand bit about nature of science . 
9720	2071	Science is never absolutely certain , and is never finished . 
9721	2071	ASPECT_BASIC_PREMISE of science is to admit that neither researcher or instruments can ever be perfect - you do best you can , make estimate of how close you figure you probably got to truth , and then leave best record you can as guide to person to come along and tackle problem . 
9722	2071	's true of even well established and respected theories in science . 
9723	2071	Take theory of gravity - PREMISE does n't get certain then gravity , does THEORY ? 
9724	2071	And yet just years ago ASPECT_NASA sent up satellite called gravity probe to try and poke holes in . 
9725	2071	As far as scientists are concerned , YEARS win win - if SCIENTISTS can find holes , then SCIENTISTS can address SCIENTISTS and make theory better , and if SCIENTISTS ca n't , YEARS increases confidence scientists have in theory . 
9726	2071	So I 'm not really sure what `` official pronouncements you may have heard , but I can guarantee that no peer reviewed article would have made claim with absolute certainty . 
9727	2071	In fact , I figure NO 's then likely that what you heard was n't coming from scientists at ; it was probably ASPECT_NEWS_MEDIUM taking tentative research and blowing RESEARCH up to make good headline . 
9728	2071	You know how people complain that one day scientists say that food will make you live hundred years , and ASPECT_DAY_PEOPLE 're saying ONE 'll kill you ? 
9729	2071	's not science doing , 's media . 
9730	2071	scientist will say , `` Well , after following so people for so years who were eating so much of food , YOU saw following outcomes . 
9731	2071	Science is in business of dealing with very complex and hard to understand things , BUSINESS 's in business of nuance . 
9732	2071	As I think PEOPLE know , ASPECT_NEWS_MEDIUM does n't much care for complexity or nuance . 
9733	2071	So , does apply to climate change ? 
9735	2071	Are scientists absolutely certain that human caused climate change is happening ? 
9737	2071	Could NO. turn out later that was big mistake , misinterpretation of faulty data or ? 
9739	2071	Then why should we listen to warnings of climate change ? 
9740	2071	Because life never gives we certainties , and WE can do is make best decisions we can with what WE have . 
9741	2071	Generally speaking , science gets better as time goes on . 
9742	2071	What scientist says today is going to be more reliable then what they were saying yesterday . 
9743	2071	Global warming has been major topic of research for good thirty years now , and as time goes on , evidence that TIME is happening has mounted , and uncertainties shrunken , until today there is consensus in scientific community that evidence overwhelmingly says EVIDENCE is happening . 
9744	2071	TOPIC 's about as certain as science ever gets about anything . 
9745	2071	In fact , uncertainty is now so low that ASPECT_AMERICAN association for ASPECT_ADVANCEMENT ASPECT_OF ASPECT_SCIENCE -LRB- ASPECT_AAAS -RRB- and national academy of Sciences -LRB- NAS -RRB- have issued quite literally unprecedented statements about climate change . 
9746	2071	They 're saying that climate change is happening , ONES 're ones doing QUESTION , QUESTION 's going to be bad , and we 'd better do about QUESTION . 
9747	2071	aaas and nas have \* never issued call to action like before , about anything . 
9748	2071	Why should you listen to NEVER ? 
9749	2071	Because NEVER 're prestigious , most well respected organizations of smartest , most well informed , and geekiest people on planet . 
9750	2071	NEVER 've been around since mid nineteenth century and have huge reputations to protect - NEVER reputations are NEVER bread and butter . 
9751	2071	There are probably no organizations on planet with stronger reason to make sure never never ever say anything could later make NEVER look foolish . 
9752	2071	guys are crown jewels of science , and what guys say is about as close as you 're going to get to official pronouncement of what science knows . 
9753	2071	If you 're not convinced by what GUYS say , then from science will ever convince you of anything . 
9754	2071	And 's not just scientists . 
9755	2071	ASPECT_PENTAGON takes climate change so seriously that SCIENTISTS did n't even consider question of pentagon reality in February 2010 quadrennial defense review -LRB- QDR -RRB- and went directly to considering how to deal with pentagon effects . 
9756	2071	There 's even organization of major industries called ASPECT_US ASPECT_CLIMATE ASPECT_ACTION partnership calling for immediate action on issue , includes companies like ASPECT_ALCOA , ASPECT_FORD , ASPECT_GM , ASPECT_CHRYSLER , ASPECT_GE , dow and dupont . 
9757	2071	are of companies are going to be most directly effected by action to tackle climate change , and 're saying we need to do QUESTION , now . 
9758	2071	If you 're not going to believe guys , who are you going to believe ? 
9759	2071	Seriously , 's not rhetorical question . 
9760	2071	Who are you going to believe ? 
9761	2071	aaas statement : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.aaas.org \ \/ news\/releases\/20 ... tatement .

9762	2073	Youngster , , , , , , , thousands , , , , , , , , , , Maybe millions of very definitive statements were made by scientists , writers , reporters , mathematicians , farmers , etc. etc. . 
9763	2073	Definitive statements on about subject imaginable . 
9764	2073	All before present ridiculous `` age of ASPECT_POLITICAL_CORRECTNESS . 
9765	2073	Now none open thousands mouths without `` plausible deniability . 
9766	2073	`` fact that have stones to make statement today , does not mean that FACT was not commonly done in past . 
9767	2074	Hey , I 'm not saying that scientists are n't just as human as everyone else . 
9768	2074	We have bad tendency to overstate we certainty at times , including I . 
9769	2074	But basic principles of scientific method have been firmly established for centuries . 
9770	2074	And there 's big difference between what scientist may say in casual conversation , or even when being interviewed by reporter , and what scientists put in SCIENTISTS formal articles for peer reviewed publications . 
9771	2074	There is no as absolute certainty , ever . 
9772	2074	None of YOU are infallible , and YOU believe things now will later turn out to be wrong . 
9773	2074	You scientist , everyone . 
9774	2074	And science is in business of not only being aware of inherent uncertainty in life , but to actually quantify BUSINESS . 
9775	2074	And uncertainty YOU have in reality of climate change is now really really small . 
9776	2074	I mean , think about UNCERTAINTY - is ASPECT_PENTAGON in habit of chasing after latest intellectual fad ? 
9777	2074	If military takes climate change seriously enough to devote significant resources to planning for military effects , do n't you think that maybe you should take MILITARY seriously too ? 
9778	2075	I know what you mean , old people are really dumb in ASPECT_AMERICA , and PEOPLE tend to be very politically correct when ASPECT_AMERICA comes to ASPECT_ISRAEL . 
9779	2076	Why would I vote for further destruction of I country ? 
9780	2078	Maybe teabagger you hate so much might come up and kick -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -lrb- -RRB- bag-in-chiefs ass in 2012 . 
9781	2079	We are now 23 months out from 2012 end of error . 
9782	2079	At point in time before 2008 mistake , 23 unbelievable incompetence , obamalama had not announced 23 was running to destroy presidency . 
9783	2081	Yes , Republicans have tall order to fill , but with ASPECT_OBAMA still at helm , and ASPECT_REID still in charge of ASPECT_SENATE , ORDER will most likely be gridlock , which is not so bad when you look at ASPECT_OBAMA agenda . 
9784	2081	There is still plenty of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC face in ASPECT_WASHINGTON . 
9785	2081	Not of cards are in hands of Republicans . 
9786	2083	DanNO40 is just another disgruntled , military retiree who , like drunk sailor , regurgitates SAILOR slurred , negative comments lack substance and sources for authenticity . 
9787	2083	IOW , IOW mostly opinion and fetid hot air . 
9788	2083	As matter of fact , DanNO actually makes ASPECT_OBAMA look brilliant by contrast . 
9789	2083	MATTER 's not that FAN am die-hard ASPECT_OBAMA_FAN . 
9790	2083	FAN am not . 
9791	2083	But , considering unnecessary concessions ASPECT_OBAMA has made to get bi-partisan support , FAN now concede that ASPECT_OBAMA probably will be one-term president . 
9792	2083	Day-by-day , -LRB- recent pay freeze on executive government employees insures that overworked , understaffed agencies will NOT be able to enforce current law , let alone that ASPECT_CONGRESS passes . -RRB-

9797	2086	blind drunken lemming well beyond 100 supportive of incompetent obamalama denies that OBAMALAMA is completely brainwashed supporter of presidential idiot no matter what supporter fxxks up now and forever , accuses OBAMALAMA of `` slurred comments ? 
9798	2086	You may find republican comments NOT to your liking but they are certainly not ` slurred . 
9799	2086	` And as proof of your mindless support in spite of facts to contrary , REPUBLICAN cite your statement , unnecessary concessions ASPECT_OBAMA has made to get bi-partisan support , . 
9800	2086	incompetent idiot obamalama has made NO bi-partisan efforts other than ASPECT_LIP_SERVICE to words . 
9801	2086	of his actions have been completely leftist partisanship actions . 
9802	2086	OBAMALAMA has made NO concessions , no compromises , no negotiations . 
9803	2086	OBAMALAMA has asked that Republicans -LRB- and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN 'm NOT republican -rrb- to show bi-partisanship by capitulating and agreeing with ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_IDIOCY . 
9804	2086	is what left wing idiots see as bi-partisan effort . 
9805	2086	EFFORT is insult to party no matter who does EFFORT . 
9806	2086	dum-dum obamalama has not served day in ASPECT_WHITE_HOUSE where OBAMALAMA has needed single ASPECT_REPUBLICAN vote on anything and ASPECT_OBAMALAMA has not received single ASPECT_REPUBLICAN vote got bill passed . 
9807	2086	Democrats have been coerced , bribed , and earmarked into voting for what OBAMALAMA wanted . 
9808	2086	Do NOT try to blame of bills passed 2 years on Republicans . 
9809	2086	blame is totally Democrat . 
9810	2086	Since jan. 3 2007 , ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY has had and does have until jan 2011 , control of both houses of ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
9811	2086	Republicans could neither vote bill down nor block vote on bill since 1\/3\/2007 . 
9812	2086	And to finalize your utter wrongness . 
9813	2086	REPUBLICAN am retired and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN did serve in military and am honorably discharged . 
9814	2086	But REPUBLICAN 'm retired businessman , not retired ASPECT_MILITARY_OFFICER . 
9815	2086	REPUBLICAN served honorably and well and then moved on with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_LIFE . 
9816	2087	No , I want healthy economy ! 
9817	2089	I would love Libertarian too kick LIBERTARIAN ass !

9830	2091	FAN reproduce fan original post so that there is no doubt about what FAN said before one reads DanNO40 post , quoted above . 
9831	2091	First , if DanNO was ASPECT_MILITARY_OFFICER , FAN now understand why current crop -LRB- over 60 years -RRB- of military officers are idealogical puritans compared to led us after WWII . 
9832	2091	current horse hockey rampage over ASPECT_DADT is indicative of bigotry and intolerance -LRB- and perhaps , `` homophobia fears OFFICERS conceal in officers hearts -RRB- 18th century ideologues have instilled in minds of lay public at large . 
9833	2091	If gays of either gender are openly accepted , gays inappropriate sexual behavior will be no condoned\/tolerated than of inappropriate heterosexual behavior . 
9834	2091	To quote popular president , `` GAYS have to fear but fear behavior ! 
9835	2091	`` As for DanNO claim to be businessman , PRESIDENT 'd say business community behavior since WWII is about which to be proud , i.e. systematic `` bubble to `` burst to recession and subsequent climatic downward spiral for ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS . 
9836	2091	Reciting figures to prove slide is reported daily in newspaper op-ed , so to quote SLIDE again here is redundant . 
9837	2091	In response to : -LRB- RevAnarchist would be wonderful Jollee , and there are libertarians at heart run as republicans . 
9838	2091	As you know , Libertarians are for less big ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_AND want individual responsibility . 
9839	2091	FAN beleive instead of government entitlement programs local community especially church should provide for in need . 
9840	2091	Of course -LRB- government -rrb- safety net should be available for working poor and single moms , who are high on fan respect list , very high ! 
9841	2091	Maybe with enough prayer and work ASPECT_ELECTABLE_CANDIDATE may emerge . 
9842	2091	There are good republicans and couple may be electable with right political machine behind REPUBLICANS . 
9843	2091	media , especially cesspools like ASPECT_MSNBC attack conservative candidates as well as sitting presidents and members of congress etc. . 
9844	2091	CANDIDATES ruined ASPECT_PALIN with well crafted propagandist hack job capitalized on palins inexperience and her unpolished political persona . 
9845	2091	her lack of nonsensical knowledge was used as ambush to further discredit her through no fault of HER . 
9846	2091	However ASPECT_PALIN is accomplished intelligent and good politician , HER simply had mean powerful groups against her and groups hurt HER . 
9847	2091	Personally FAN think GROUPS -LRB- MSNBC of media etc -rrb- propaganda and hack job was repugnant and demonstrated how low groups would go to smear that GROUPS did not like , namely white christian woman . 
9848	2091	Maybe karma police will pay GROUPS back in full . 
9849	2091	Hey we can hope and pray for justice eh Jollee ? 
9850	2091	rev -rrb- fan have one to say : FAN categorically disagree with word you posted . 
9851	2091	ASPECT_PALIN is beauty pageant air head with penchant , like ASPECT_BRATBOY ASPECT_BUSH , to appeal to simplistic , folksy , anti-elitist moralistic attitude of we wish for but never had nor will have . 
9852	2091	What you tout is artificial to reality . 
9853	2091	TODAY synthetic flavored ice-slush with which ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN won Presidency , and PRESIDENCY even less true today than TODAY was then : `` churches wo n't fill needs for poor and today 's idealogical vagrant government does n't .

9891	2106	Hell , ASPECT_CHARLIE ASPECT_RANGEL could do better job than Opie so no vote for Messiah in 2012 . 
9892	2107	hA hA hA , your statement CRACKED me up guy ! 
9893	2107	your funny ! 
9895	2108	Your `` thinking is evidently deeply influenced by your ideological brainwashing . 
9896	2108	Americans , majority , NOT brainwashed liberal ideologues , are extremely angry at gross incompetence and often incredible stupidity of obamalama . 
9897	2108	INCOMPETENCE is not disappointment , INCOMPETENCE IS anger . 
9898	2108	people disappointed are idiots thought OBAMALAMA had anything to offer in place , ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_DID_NOT . 
9899	2108	OBAMALAMA got elected by claiming to be different from ASPECT_BUSH . 
9900	2108	Turns out ASPECT_OBAMALAMA is different from ASPECT_BUSH . 
9901	2108	OBAMALAMA worse than ASPECT_BUSH . 
9902	2108	far out from 2008 election , NOBODY had ever heard of BHO except bho puppetmasters . 
9903	2108	So between now and 2012 elections dozen or candidates can appear in limelight . 
9904	2108	And if obamalama continues to do as rotten as job as OBAMALAMA has , , , , , , , , , half new candidates could be liberal democrats . 
9905	2109	Originally Posted by megadethfan view post dan FOR PRESIDENT I agree with your post dan . 
9906	2109	ASPECT_OBAMA is so stupid ASPECT_OBAMA may think like mega death and think ASPECT_OBAMA can hide ASPECT_OBAMA_LIE and smooth over ASPECT_OBAMA_MISTAKE , and beleive that majority of ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTER are n't angry with OBAMA ... how in world could VOTERS be mad at golden boy ? 
9907	2109	At messiah ? 
9908	2109	Ha ha we will show MESSIAH how angry we are come ASPECT_ELECTION_TIME ! 
9909	2109	Hey did you hear that federal judge ruled on Monday that ASPECT_OBAMACARE is unconstitutional ? 
9910	2109	I have been saying that along . 
9911	2109	I said ASPECT_OBAMA is stupid , ASPECT_OBAMA is but ASPECT_OBAMA is dangerous stupid like serial killer is dangerous stupid . 
9912	2109	DID do not know right from wrong in cases . 
9913	2109	is ASPECT_OBAMA in nutshell -LRB- pun intended -rrb- . 
9914	2109	OBAMA thinks ASPECT_OBAMA is doing us favor , when in ASPECT_REALITY_OBAMA is worst has happened to country since another dumb democrat ; ASPECT_JIMMY_CARTER . 
9915	2109	ASPECT_CARTER is better citizen than president . 
9917	2110	Mega , what direction has he shown ? 
9918	2110	ASPECT_BUSH popularity is getting close to ASPECT_BUSH . 
9919	2110	Do you realize if ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE goes down tubes then accomplishment ASPECT_BUSH has 's significant is backing ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT ... ironic , huh . 
9922	2110	ASPECT_LOWDEN pointed that out ... here lowden ??? 
9923	2113	It is utterly amazing !!! 
9924	2113	Democrats have had control of house and senate since Jan , 3 . 
9926	2113	And retain control until end of year . 
9927	2113	Yet in 1095 days they have managed to pass failed ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL . 
9928	2113	unconstitutional and horrendous ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL is worst legislation ever considered let alone passed , and THEY have passed business regulation bill makes ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUSINESS difficult to be in and completely non-competitive with nation anywhere , and you blame conservatives . 
9929	2113	ASPECT_LIBERAL loonyism at bill best . 
9930	2113	You had Democrat votes to pass ANYTHING , and only accomplished sadly ridiculous bills . 
9931	2113	conservatives have not had power to pass or STOP anything for nearly 1100 days and you claim days conservatives fault . 
9933	2114	Tried and kicked out of office where have you been ? 
9934	2116	Hi brother ! 
9936	2118	And if he listens to you he presidency will END !! 
9937	2118	Liberalism is evil that conservatives have been compromising with in my lifetime . 
9938	2118	EVIL is time for to END ! 
9939	2118	... ... -LRB- How is that for target -RRB- live conservatism ... 's right , time bell rings another liberal is defeated \*\* 
9940	2123	Got to be tough when your trying to boost jobs , help your country and hide COUNTRY from your base ... Dear god ... 
9941	2124	What do you mean ? 
9942	2125	Well if ASPECT_OBAMA wants to keep his job his may have to make deals in private that HIS left base might not agree with , so to prevent them from getting to upset back room deals with repub or corp. figures may be essential . 
9943	2125	certain guarantees in words . 
9944	2125	I 'm not saying is bad , but smart politics . 
9945	2125	HIS knows creating jobs is how HIS will have best chance at re election , I 'm sure played big part in HIS extending ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
9946	2125	Good for HIS , but left was not very happy . 
9947	2128	's very liberal attitude . 
9948	2128	No , one should simply restrain ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_INTERVENTION in market altogether . 
9949	2128	government should n't be giving money to big or small businesses nor to individuals . 
9950	2129	ASPECT_OBAMA has BASICALLY converted to right wing conservatism , biggie obviously being extended ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT . 
9951	2129	`` What conversion by obamalama . 
9952	2129	CAPITULATION was and complete capitulation by Republicans misreading ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPINION as ASPECT_DEOMCRATS have done since 2007 . 
9953	2129	deomcrats got deomcrats unfunded unemployment extension , AND UNFUNDED ASPECT_STIMULUS_MONEY in exchange for extending ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT which with mini-brain KNEW was going to happen anyway . 
9954	2129	And dems did not care if CARE happened or not , NOT were only posturing time . 
9955	2129	If Repubs had cajones , NOT would have called bluff and said tax cuts extension period , NO deals . 
9956	2129	NO way were Dems going to allow 50 ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE on ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS . 
9957	2129	100 certain , NOT would have caved . 
9958	2129	Chances are ASPECT_112TH ASPECT_CONGRESS will be just as stupid as 110th , and 111th were . 
9959	2131	If ASPECT_LEFT_WING_MEDIUM would ignore ASPECT_PALIN , she would just fade away . 
9960	2131	But they can not avoid taking advantage of obvious whipping girl . 
9961	2131	easier to trash ASPECT_PALIN than do reporting work and find story . 
9962	2131	Diplomatic skills ??? 
9963	2131	skills have made obamalama and ASPECT_US laughing stock of world . 
9964	2131	ASPECT_BHO has been absolutely rejected by nation in everything bho has proposed . 
9965	2131	bho international accomplishments total exactly zero . 
9966	2131	At home , ASPECT_BHO has been president since 1\/20\/09 , yet ASPECT_BHO continues to campaign to BE president . 
9967	2131	And ASPECT_BHO has already announced that in 2011 bho will be spending less time in ASPECT_DC and time throughout ASPECT_USA . 
9968	2131	To interpret that for you , means even campaigning and less governing . 
9969	2131	BHO is very good at campaigning , so ASPECT_BHO does . 
9970	2131	BHO is very bad at being CEO , so ASPECT_BHO avoids . 
9971	2132	I agree that ASPECT_PALIN should be ignored . 
9973	2132	-LRB- I am conservative -RRB- ASPECT_OBAMA has done amazing job in mending fences with countries . 
9974	2132	ASPECT_AMERICA is no longer considered reckless bully . 
9975	2133	Cant keep good poster down aye ? 
9976	2133	... LOL Makes sense to me , problem being there are so uninformed people out there and 's what POSTER plays too . 
9977	2133	So if economy improves PEOPLE will give POSTER credit , what has to be done is make sure that people get reminded is guy that we had at start . 
9978	2133	poster basic stripes have not changed , and pushing and fighting with right over ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE should remind PEOPLE of . 
9979	2133	ME think would be smart of Repubs to keep ASPECT_OBAMA_CARE , border , ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABY all up front . 
9980	2133	If REPUBS gets elected for another term term will turn into another spend thon . 
9981	2134	If you do n't like ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABY , change Constitution and statutes . 
9982	2135	ASPECT_ANCHOR_BABY came to be by Constitutional amendment , not by inclusion in original constitution . 
9983	2135	And Amendment was intended to cover babies of slaves brought to country against BABIES will . 
9984	2135	It was not intended to cover people that smuggled babies into country illegally . 
9985	2136	Now ASPECT_AMERICA is considered foolish and naive patsy . 
9986	2136	We were considered foolish and naive back in 30 too . 
9987	2136	How 'd turn out ? 
9988	2137	I go with ... I think Legal immigration is important to countries and they should have open arms to people . 
9989	2137	But what is biggest threat to legal immigration ? 
9990	2137	, illegal immigration 's what . 
9991	2137	Illegal immigration robs us of truly worthy immigrant and rewards illegal one ... ONE 'S THREAT TO EVERYBODY . 
9992	2137	I resent fact that country thinks so little of honest immigrant . 
9993	2137	What does say about ASPECT_US ? 
9994	2137	anchor baby IS NOTHING MORE THAN PRODUCT OF ILLEGAL immigrant . 
9995	2137	They say , well PRODUCT not BABY fault . 
9996	2137	Well PRODUCT 's not ours ! 
9997	2137	, and should have no rights . 
9998	2139	ASPECT_OBAMA is definitely running again and wo n't be challenged . 
9999	2139	As far as ASPECT_GOP is concerned , solid bet is romney and gingrinch . 
10000	2139	I do n't think ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN will run at . 
10001	2139	I 'm not sure about rest of gop candidates ... 
10002	2140	No , is pack of lies ! 
10003	2140	BULLY 're still bully as before ! 
10004	2141	Who told you that ? 
10005	2141	issue was hardly that ASPECT_JAPAN thought ASPECT_US would be quiky . 
10006	2141	Roosevelt was thirsting for war , and did everything in roosevelt power to provoke ISSUE -LRB- as ASPECT_CONGRESS was staunchly isolationist -rrb- . 
10007	2141	To quote united states general ASPECT_HUGH ASPECT_JOHNSON : `` ASPECT_JOHNSON know of no well informed ASPECT_WASHINGTON observer who is n't convinced that , if ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_ROOSEVELT is elected -LRB- in 1940 -rrb- , ASPECT_ROOSEVELT will drag YOU into war at opportunity , and that , if none presents 1940 , ROOSEVELT will make one . 
10008	2141	`` ASPECT_JOHNSON was n't so concerned with ASPECT_JAPAN , but rather hitler and seized upon opportunity Axis ' tripartite agreement afforded . 
10009	2141	ASPECT_JOHNSON actually tried to maneuver Admirals into full out blockade of japanese shipping at one point , but naturally protested vigorously and idea was dropped . 
10010	2141	So ASPECT_JOHNSON had to settle for oil embargos -LRB- which observer fully support , by way , but 's neither here nor there -RRB- . 
10011	2141	No one is going to be attacking ASPECT_AMERICA , nation of over 300 million people and size of european continent , nation which has strongest army , airforce , and navy known , nation that hosts ASPECT_UN and worlds financial headquarters . 
10012	2141	No matter how you spin ONE , ASPECT_AMERICA can not look like pansy . 
10013	2141	ONE is simply impossible . 
10014	2141	Of course , is terribly inconvenient to alarmist neo-conservatives and YOU much touted `` preemptive defense measures . 
10015	2142	You might think about : rudy giulianimike huckabeejeb bushcharlie cristron pauljohn boehner 
10016	2143	ASPECT_PAUL is one I would vote for . 
10017	2143	I would sooner see ASPECT_HUCKABEE gunned down than PAUL hind end in ASPECT_OVAL_OFFICE . 
10018	2143	I hate man ; ASPECT_HUCKABEE religious zealot bearing face of woodchuck -- what could be worse ? 
10019	2143	And god forbid we get another ASPECT_BUSH in office ... would be disaster of monstrous proportions . 
10020	2143	ASPECT_CRIST is schmuck and ASPECT_GIULLANI is just odd . 
10021	2144	Are you saying that attack on World ASPECT_TRADE_CENTER did not happen ? 
10022	2144	Or that successful attack on target on 9\/11 did not happen either . 
10023	2144	Or tennis shoe bomber and underwear bombers are fiction too ? 
10024	2144	Who made up printer cartridge bombs ? 
10025	2144	alarmist , neo-conservatives ? 
10026	2144	Or that ASPECT_KOREA or ASPECT_IRAN is not insane enough to attack us . 
10027	2144	And attack on ASPECT_US was unthinkable , by us , in 30 too . 
10028	2144	But ASPECT_JAPAN thought that single devastating blow would cause ASPECT_US to sue for peace . 
10029	2144	ASPECT_GERMANY was sinking ships right off ASPECT_US coast , that in case you were unaware , is Act of War . 
10030	2144	And who told me ?? 
10031	2144	One of us , evidently not you , was alive then . 
10032	2144	ME guess ONE was ME . 
10033	2144	old fart . 
10034	2145	I do n't see ASPECT_GUILIANI running again , not with conservative upswing . 
10035	2145	ASPECT_MIKE ASPECT_HUCKABEE might . 
10036	2145	ASPECT_BUSH I do n't know . 
10037	2145	charlie crist will most certainly not run after ASPECT_CRIST left party to run as independent . 
10038	2145	ASPECT_RON_PAUL might , but ASPECT_PAUL old and will be nonexistent in terms of primary results like ASPECT_PAUL was in 2008 . 
10039	2145	And why would ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_BOEHNER run when ASPECT_BOEHNER about to become Speaker again ? 
10040	2145	Maybe ASPECT_BOEHNER 'll consider 2008 in 2016 . 
10041	2146	What are you on about ? 
10042	2146	ATTACK never denied that attacks occurred on ASPECT_UNITED_STATE -LRB- although , to suggest that disgruntled individual wielding printer cartridges is `` attack on sovereign soil is , shall we say , unique viewpoint -rrb- . 
10043	2146	Why were german sinking we ships ? 
10045	2146	Why did ASPECT_JAPAN attack ? 
10046	2146	WE cut off oil supplies . 
10047	2146	ATTACK 'm not denying of occurred . 
10048	2146	Nor am ATTACK attempting to argue that Axis used methods differing from above when attacking ASPECT_US . 
10049	2146	What attack am saying , however , is that we involvement in WWII was not because rest of world thought WE were `` pansies . 
10050	2146	INVOLVEMENT would be analogous to attacking even better armed china , rising military and economic power of time , on virtue of them being perceived as `` weak . 
10051	2146	Obviously no sentiments like exist today ; was case in 1938 as well . 
10052	2146	To suggest otherwise is ludicrous . 
10053	2147	Sure I will !! 
10054	2148	Yes correct , churches should get of it ! 
10056	2150	I think ASPECT_HUGO_CHAVEZ has issue about natural-born citizenship to contend with . 
10057	2150	In order for I to seriously considering voting for ASPECT_OBAMA , Republicans would have to nominate like ASPECT_CHARLIE_MANSON - although I might consider ASPECT_CHARLES ASPECT_MANSON and michael savage ASPECT_GOP_TICKET . 
10058	2150	ORDER could n't be much worse then what we 've got , and they might actually surprise WE - much like ASPECT_JESSE ASPECT_VENTURA did as governor of ASPECT_MINNESOTA ! 
10059	2152	as and how so ? 
10060	2153	years ago when ASPECT_SOUTH ASPECT_FLORIDA was struck with horrible hurricanes , I remember watching TV and there was ASPECT_JEB_BUSH , I believe governor of ASPECT_FLORIDA at time . 
10061	2153	I was actually quite surprised to learn that ASPECT_BUSH could talk well , ASPECT_BUSH could formulate pertinent and interesting comments , ASPECT_BUSH was n't reading from notes or teleprompters , ASPECT_BUSH was poised and mature , ASPECT_BUSH was in command , ASPECT_BUSH shared stage with emergency personnel , on important stuff bush spoke fluently in english and spanish ... and ... ASPECT_BUSH had no resemblance or quirkiness to ASPECT_BUSH sr and jr. . 
10063	2153	. 
10063	2153	true father must have been milk man with higher iq ! 
10064	2153	I do n't know anything else about FATHER but on day and during week I was quite impressed ... 
10065	2154	My guess is of MY named will entertain idea of running for president because they believe THEY have ` right ' answers to complex problems and they egos are large enough to fill Oprah pants suit . 
10066	2154	In politics egos rule day ... 
10067	2155	Truthfully ... ASPECT_OBAMA was least qualified and least experienced ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE in recent history . 
10068	2155	Why would be surprised if person lacking appropriate credentials might fail to live up to expectations ? 
10069	2155	I blame ASPECT_OBAMA for being so arrogant to believe PERSON was qualified to run for president ... but I blame voters for being so fricken stupid when VOTERS enter voting booth . 
10070	2155	Until ignorance and personal bias wanes about 1000 , I suspect we will continue to elect less-than-qualified candidates to ASPECT_CONGRESS and presidency ... 
10071	2156	What you have been saying is that no one would dare attack us . 
10072	2156	is dumbest head-in-the-sand position that could possibly take . 
10073	2156	ONE 've pointed out to you that POSITION has happened to ASPECT_US before . 
10074	2156	You try to excuse prior attacks by claiming ASPECT_US were complicit in us attacks . 
10075	2156	DOES not matter even if true . 
10076	2156	ASPECT_US were still attacked and if you 're crazy enough to believe ASPECT_US will not be attacked again , you invite attack . 
10077	2157	Which it is , of course ; and yes COURSE does , of course . 
10078	2157	is akin to saying , `` One must walk around YES home with hardhat on because ONE might collapse -- has happened to me before ! 
10079	2157	True , ME never got around to building that fourth wall ... but you never know ! 
10080	2157	Why would be attacking YOU without reason ? 
10081	2157	Nobody is saying scrap navy and airforce . 
10082	2157	Quite contrary . 
10083	2157	Either way , you 're not really addressing issue . 
10084	2157	You stated that ASPECT_UNITED_STATE came under attack because we were considered weak . 
10085	2157	is both patently erroneous and demonstrably untrue . 
10086	2159	You 're defending incompetent clown , I 'm defending history . 
10087	2159	You 're welcome to your opinion , I 'll keep mine . 
10088	2160	If CHRISTIAN were not christian christian would hope for fate to befall ASPECT_OBAMA . 
10089	2160	CHRISTIAN am truly surprised FATE has n't happened -LRB- yet -rrb- . 
10090	2160	So much for scary white supremacists ! 
10091	2160	Heck , radical -LRB- black -RRB- Muslims do dirty to black leaders of note heck seems . 
10092	2160	Barnyism ' was n't reason CHRISTIAN did n't vote for ASPECT_OBAMA , neither was ASPECT_OBAMA_COLOR , well except for yellow stripe running up ASPECT_OBAMA_SPINE . 
10093	2160	No obamas liberal ideas -LRB- ie abortion -RRB- , gross ignorance of economic affairs , and lack of ASPECT_EXECUTIVE_EXPERIENCE are of defects which disqualify ASPECT_OBAMA as ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL . 
10094	2160	CHRISTIAN do n't consider personal appearance when voting for man , if CHRISTIAN said why is so , CHRISTIAN may get infraction . 
10095	2160	Anyway , look at ASPECT_OBAMA , ASPECT_OBAMA looks like cross between barney fife and Dumbo with ears . 
10096	2160	As for religious guys in office , relax as long as GUYS are christian you have to worry about . 
10097	2160	Look at history religious presidents have been popular and best . 
10098	2160	atheist as president ! 
10099	2160	Ha ha much worse ! 
10100	2160	Truly , your opinions of what represents good ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL is horrifying . 
10102	2161	Whilst I agree in part , his opponents were far worse . 
10103	2161	Now in retrospect YOU can see ASPECT_OBAMA has actually continued many of failed policies of ASPECT_OBAMA_PREDECESSOR . 
10104	2161	So you vote on looks ? 
10105	2161	Actually if are Christian you have crap load to worry about - so does rest of world . 
10108	2161	LOL is so ignorant , but says lot about you Rev. How so ? 
10110	2162	I have read several of your posts . 
10111	2162	You seem to be too concerned as to why happened . 
10112	2162	If nut broke in your home and shot your family would your have to ask why NUT happened before you eliminated threat ? 
10113	2162	Just curious . 
10114	2162	~ rev ~ 
10115	2164	PRINCIPLE very simple principle known as cause and effect . 
10116	2164	They are mutually inclusive ; one can not exist without . 
10117	2164	International politics are not as simple as disgruntled robber . 
10118	2164	Which one has n't been Christian ? 
10119	2164	What horribly constructed argument . 
10120	2164	ONE 'm not even sure how to deal with ... 's not like Christians have ever gotten ASPECT_US involved in illegitimate wars , and ASPECT_US not as if SERVANTS 've ever infringed upon civil liberties . 
10121	2164	Nor is likely that single christian president has ever crafted single policy in error . 
10122	2164	You see , SERVANTS 're servants of Lord . 
10123	2164	SERVANTS can do no wrong . 
10124	2164	Yes , god forbid rational person find PERSON in office . 
10125	2164	As you well know , we non-practicing heathens dream of ASPECT_MARXIST_UTOPIA in which Muslims actually have rights and people abort children for fun . 
10126	2164	What is new ASPECT_JERUSALEM nonsense ? 
10127	2164	You 've been watching too history mysteries episodes . 
10128	2164	Regarding second question , about which type of leader one would prefer : ONE would spring for ASPECT_AYN_RAND . 
10130	2164	whose defending ? 
10131	2164	sincerest apologies , but revisionism does n't count . 
10132	2165	Why do you not vote . 
10133	2165	If it is because of apathy , then why not support falgaft plan ??? 
10134	2165	Is IT not time that us citizen took back control of country . 
10135	2166	Nor is International politics as simple as cause and effect which depends on logic , far from anything remotely applicable to international politics . 
10136	2166	ha ha . 
10137	2166	IP are more like qm or Chaos theory in nature . 
10138	2166	You expressed doubt that ASPECT_AMERICAN presidents were christian , CHRISTIAN was simply attempting to get you to support your unsubstantiated claims . 
10139	2166	Answer question and please do n't quit YOU day job for stand up comedy , you will starve 's why you self described `` non-practicing heathens dream of ASPECT_MARXIST_UTOPIA in which Muslims actually have rights and people abort children for fun will never make president , thank God . 
10140	2166	BTW , abortions are n't for fun , but rather nearly as sinister and repulsive , CHILDREN are performed for convenience of mom and dad . 
10141	2166	Nah , CHRISTIAN theories are different than history mysteries etc. . 
10142	2166	kinds of pseudo educational channels injects too artistic license into CHILDREN doctrine . 
10143	2166	CHRISTIAN am christian and prophesy is clear , btw there will be new jerusalem one day as well as new temple etc. . 
10144	2166	Just as sure as new ASPECT_ISRAEL came into existence as per bible prophesy . 
10145	2166	One need not watch anti christian ASPECT_HISTORY_CHANNEL , to read bible to determine facts and what is to be . 
10146	2166	Well you could of picked much worse . 
10147	2166	rands objectivism seems bit like libertarianism , maybe MOTHER was mother of liberalism so MOTHER may be ok . 
10149	2167	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- I 'd become Republican if Republicans nominated ASPECT_HUGO_CHAVEZ . 
10150	2168	Actually , fundamentally , it is . 
10151	2168	's IT is . 
10152	2168	IT just happens to be incredibly convoluted and impossible to discern which ripples will affect what . 
10153	2168	But idea is to formulate projections and , subsequently , manipulate as best as is possible . 
10155	2168	I 've done no ... It appears you 've forgotten there was no question ; rather , just ill-conceived statement . 
10156	2168	And I was n't being humorous ; I was being sardonic . 
10157	2168	There is distinct difference . 
10158	2169	-LRB- quote = ASPECT_PLYMOUTH ; 3291039 -RRB- Actually , fundamentally , QUOTE is . 
10159	2169	's QUOTE is .

10162	2169	Sorry maybe was MD ? 
10163	2169	you outsiders look to me ... Ok , is going to be ME post today . 
10164	2169	ME am tired and obvious by me typo ets . 
10166	2169	ha ha . 
10168	2169	ME mean etc . 
10169	2169	Again your reply -LRB- after paragraph and me typo -RRB- has no substance , REPLY about personal bs will be filed as . 
10170	2169	ME was using dual slit experiment as analogy . 
10171	2169	analogy demonstrated that we can know to degree of probability which slit particle will take . 
10172	2169	WE know type of probabilities well enough to make calculations and probabilistic outcome of calculations are accurate enough to design circuits . 
10173	2169	just as ME pointed out . 
10174	2169	Nevertheless , even though WE know with exceedingly high degree which slit particle will take there is still chance that particle will do unexpected and take slit that PARTICLE ` should n't ' according to rules of probability . 
10175	2169	circuit may fail if happens . 
10176	2169	's bad for circuits but good for people because that tiny fractional lee way is room WE require for free will to exist . 
10177	2169	is because if God knew with accuracy of 100 exactly future and what choices we would make we free will would not , and could not exist . 
10179	2170	Id become republican if republicans nominated me for president . 
10180	2170	Anyway ~ On unrelated topic we gotta ' love we poll ! -RRB- 
10181	2170	Two to one against ASPECT_NOBAMA , indicates there is intelligent life in forum ! 
10183	2171	nomination one and counting ... 
10184	2172	Started out Terrible ... maybe change meant -LRB- 3rd ,4 th years of presidency -rrb- ? 
10185	2172	Hope\/Change = Dope in Charge -LRB- hopefully not -RRB- ! 
10186	2174	Care too elaborate ? 
10188	2175	i simply disagree with majority of his positions . 
10189	2175	i like guy personally , but i do n't see way for GUY to get I vote in 2012 given guy policies . 
10190	2176	MYSELF could not have said it better myself ... Jollee 
10191	2177	Well Duh ! 
10192	2177	DUH got elected because DUH seemed likable . 
10193	2177	DUH did not get elected on DUH experience or competence . 
10194	2177	And now realize that , while likable , DUH is neither Chief executive , nor competent . 
10195	2177	But DUH still seems likable and still can give helluva campaign speech . 
10196	2177	Trouble is , we do n't need speeches , WE need bi-partisan exec can get hard jobs done . 
10197	2177	obamalama ai n't guy ! 
10198	2178	He 's incompetant ! 
10199	2179	Ha ha thanks Jollee ! 
10200	2179	Hey will you be my ASPECT_VICE_PRESIDENT ? 
10202	2180	You better believe it ! 
10203	2180	We will clean place up ! 
10205	2181	Are you KIDDING ME !!! 
10206	2181	ASPECT_REASON_OBAMA chose to extend ASPECT_TAX_CUT at time is because ASPECT_OBAMA did n't want to be seen as President who presided over biggest ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE in history , and especially during deep recession . 
10207	2181	-LRB- What recovery ? -RRB- 
10208	2181	Additionally , ASPECT_OBAMA did n't want to wait until new congress got in place , because ASPECT_OBAMA_KNEW_OBAMA would n't be able to jam CONGRESS through with new tens of BILLIONS in spending . 
10209	2181	Unfortunately , line of ME shows me how little you actually understand about Conservatism . 
10210	2181	Conservatives do n't believe in government `` Giving cash to public , CONSERVATIVES believe in allowing ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR to keep as of conservatives earnings as possible . 
10211	2181	Can you imagine how much better off ASPECT_FORD -LRB- and ASPECT_GM for matter -RRB- would be if CONSERVATIVES did n't have to pay highest capital gain taxes in world , as CONSERVATIVES do here in good ol ASPECT_US of ? 
10212	2181	How cash would CONSERVATIVES have to re-invest in production as CONSERVATIVES European and asian competitors are allowed to do ? 
10213	2181	Is BETTER wonder that over 40k manufacturing plants employing average of 500 people have closed over past 2 decades in ASPECT_U.S. ? 
10214	2181	No , ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT should n't be giving anything to , Job should be relegated to local or ASPECT_STATE_GOVERNMENT where there can be tighter lid on accountability , and where NO do n't have ability to `` Magically print money , thereby reducing value of EVERYONE money . 
10215	2181	ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT job should be just 3 things : Guaranteeing personal liberty and freedom -LRB- ASPECT_FBI , ASPECT_CIA , Military and court system -RRB- Protecting border and handling trade -LRB- Customs and border patrol -RRB- Provide fair and equitable open and Free market for States to do business with otherthat liberty !!! 
10216	2181	EVERYTHING , ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , ASPECT_WELFARE , Education , social services , NO can all be handled by States with greater efficiency and better responsiveness than ASPECT_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT can . 
10217	2183	There are two ways to be qualified to be President . 
10218	2183	One - have history , legal , and political and savvy credentials Presidents have quite bit of . 
10219	2183	ole ' , ` ole . 
10220	2183	Two - be possessed of almost perfect ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE and be as honest as man can possibly be . 
10221	2183	person must be surrounded by sharp advisors . 
10222	2183	We have always depended on One to elect we presidents . 
10223	2183	I think TIME time for President with qualifications in Two . 
10224	2183	There are couple of males and couple of females might possess . 
10225	2183	One in particular . 
10226	2184	Sadly we did elect `` Two as we present president . 
10228	2186	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Of course I will . 
10229	2186	He 's done fabulous job . 
10230	2186	And we just ca n't run risk of turning country back over to republican brain-dead ideologues who took perfectly fine economy and turned ECONOMY into giant ball of snot in less than 8 years . 
10231	2189	No matter who is president , no matter high qualifications , will require specialized advisers ; running ASPECT_U_GOVERNMENT is simply too complex for one person to have complete knowledge . 
10232	2189	Regarding ` ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE ' ... as long as we have dominant two party system , and as long as voters are deeply polarized towards one of two parties , ONE is unlikely there will be common sense problem solving . 
10233	2189	Seems to ASPECT_US , in order to achieve common sense and win-win , etc. , WE must move away from two-party rule ... 
10234	2190	gm stock is selling at price stock is because ASPECT_GM raised price of additional shares being released . 
10235	2190	IF new offering works perfectly and Govt sells as shares as GOVT can under new offering , then us govt stake in ASPECT_GM will be reduced from 61 to 33 . 
10237	2190	And have no business owning 33 of ASPECT_GM just as had no business owning 61 . 
10238	2190	Vote for Jeb over obamalma could not find time in his schedule to call parents of fallen soldier after local politician screwed up condolence letter , but could find time to call philadelphia eagles and congratulate PARENTS for hiring dog murderer ASPECT_VICK ? 
10239	2190	I will not know until voting time who will get I vote . 
10240	2190	But obamalama heads list of will NOT be considered . 
10241	2191	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- If held ASPECT_RPG to my head . 
10242	2192	would depend . 
10243	2192	If choice ASPECT_JEB ASPECT_BUSH or ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA or else ? 
10244	2192	Would you vote for rep. pelosi in 2012 ? 
10245	2192	After , 2010 had absolutely to do with pelosi highness . 
10246	2192	wonder if they 've gotten keys for airplanes from ASPECT_PELOSI yet ? 
10248	2194	Better question , what makes you think ASPECT_OBAMA is socialist ? 
10249	2194	ASPECT_OBAMA_OVERT_SPENDING_ISNT_ORIGINAL . 
10250	2194	In terms of fp , ASPECT_OBAMA has n't change much and has done far less damage than ASPECT_OBAMA_PREDECESSOR . 
10251	2194	In terms of social policies , ASPECT_OBAMA is progressive , but again not unique . 
10252	2194	Socialism requires fundamental and core ideas , namely communal ownership of ` means of production ' , which ASPECT_OBAMA has not slightly indicated moving to . 
10253	2194	And of course , along side , eradication of ` ASPECT_PRIVATE_PROPERTY ' as institutionalized legal procedure . 
10254	2194	ASPECT_OBAMA has not even contemplated . 
10255	2194	Ah but then you say , ok but ASPECT_OBAMA intends to have world governance - so what ? 
10256	2194	ASPECT_OBAMA_DEFINITION of world governance is far different to yours . 
10257	2194	ASPECT_OBAMA is of legal structure - which for ASPECT_AMERICA is rather hard to grasp , but not for Europeans who have learned hard way . 
10258	2194	In terms of direct management no one is contemplating , but you are suggesting , in fact loudly purporting that is ASPECT_OBAMA_AIM . 
10259	2194	Sorry to say but belief is ignorant to say least . 
10260	2194	If will be taking direct control of anything , BELIEF will be ASPECT_AMERICA do so in countries as ASPECT_AMERICA ruling regime seeks to further regime interests , which REGIME has been doing for over 200 years . 
10261	2195	I may think ASPECT_OBAMA is socialist , but I do n't claim ASPECT_OBAMA is socialist , or rather I should say that I do n't mean to make I inner truths and dearly held convictions public , purposely . 
10264	2195	What bit of twisted grammar was ! 
10265	2195	Allow I another ? 
10266	2195	; I do mean to , and usually do say that unless wayward freudian slip encroaches upon I published internet font , I verbiage and presentations will proclaim that ASPECT_OBAMA merely cleaves heavily to things socialist , and often adopts things which is far more dangerous than even military solution in cases . 
10267	2195	issue is n't not how FREUDIAN spent but rather way FREUDIAN spends money . 
10268	2195	As I said I am claiming that FREUDIAN is trending towards socialism . 
10269	2195	In reality I beleive FREUDIAN was and is setting up necessary culture as preparing ASPECT_WALL_STREET and ` infrastructure ' to allow easy transition to socialist system I would wager you are wrong about ! 
10270	2195	I am sure freudian has contemplated dream of world wide socialism with ASPECT_USA being leading charge down path to national poverty or worse ! 
10271	2195	World governance is world governance . 
10272	2195	If FREUDIAN gets freudian way is inch to mile . 
10273	2195	Europeans are currently are paying price for learning that you hold in high regard ! 
10274	2195	CURRENTLY manifesting as bankrupt economies , bankrupt citizens , hungry people , and failures which are resulting in civil disobedience , protests in streets , and social unrest ! 
10275	2195	No citizens Europeans can keep that , including international world court . 
10276	2195	BTW , we are sovereign nation with Constitution grantees we rights and security , additionally constitution does not allow countries to meddle in we affairs . 
10277	2195	ASPECT_OBAMA is naive that seeks to appease instead of having spine . 
10278	2195	OBAMA would of spooned with ASPECT_HITLER if was 1938 because is what ASPECT_OBAMA_NAIVETY_SOW , stupidity ! 
10279	2195	Sadly for we citizens , especially ASPECT_OBAMA has duped , ASPECT_OBAMA is dumber than rock despite ASPECT_OBAMA_DEGREE and ivy league education and has and will result in untold human misery if ASPECT_OBAMA is n't stopped ASPECT_IMO . 
10280	2195	Right now damage is not great , however NOW will soon snowball . 
10281	2195	WE have time to correct ASPECT_OBAMA_MISTAKE and TIME appears with gop congress attempting to repeal so called ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL -LRB- another socialist instrument -RRB- that WE may save day yet . 
10282	2195	So , MD , I hope and pray that WE will get ASPECT_OBAMA out of office before anything else bad happens . 
10283	2195	God help WE if poo really hits fan ! 
10284	2195	No god is not direct manager imo , GOD is puppet of people with power . 
10285	2195	GOD -LRB- by wielding power of usa -rrb- may be in top three fourths in world power , but GOD is simply power broker doing bidding either knowingly or with ignorance of people really has power to control economies of nations . 
10286	2195	In fact at least one of people has said in print that GOD enjoys destroying national economies -LRB- or playing game leads up to destroying nations currency etc -rrb- . 
10287	2195	Well , with due respect ignorance you speak of is deposited in piles and heaps in your camp . 
10288	2195	Your country exists only because of power of pre-obama usa . 
10289	2195	Yes COUNTRY way we roll MD. . 
10290	2195	Sorry , I do n't want to be citizen of world , nor do I want USA to be national citizen of world . 
10291	2195	I want world to leave I and we nation alone and would hope that president has wisdom to help WE achieve isolationism which will allow WE to last thousand years . 
10292	2195	If WE instead kiss uns butt and reelect ASPECT_OBAMA or clone of ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_USA will cease to exist in less than 50 years ASPECT_IMO . 
10293	2195	Look personally I will survive -LRB- in likelihood -rrb- . 
10294	2195	However , I would rather survive in world where ASPECT_USA exists in name and in SPIRIT . 
10295	2195	reason for is because I love I fellow man as I . 
10296	2195	I desperately love children who will pay price of living and likely suffering in world without ASPECT_USA and freedom loving nations . 
10297	2195	I for one do n't want to find out , nor do I want I fellow man to discover what little shop of horrors will -LRB- or may -RRB- be like either . 
10299	2197	Yes you have honest post there . 
10300	2197	I am no different and I hate to admit POST ! 
10301	2197	When I lived in ASPECT_AK in late 80 I was making 36 dollars hour tax free with 200 week for housing as journeyman iron-worker and going to school at ASPECT_UNIVERSITY ASPECT_OF ASPECT_AK for free at night -LRB- va bill , earning credits for I c. theology ma -rrb- . 
10302	2197	I had subcontracted structural and reinforcing steel in pedestrian walkway on steel bridge towered near 200ft over bay , but they paid I by hour because I had so miserably underestimated bid . 
10303	2197	Great folks swalling construction -LRB- anchorage -rrb- ! 
10304	2197	So ten hour days I made 360 dollars plus around 50 dollars to eat on and help defer cost of room , or about 1600 tax free dollars per four day work week . 
10305	2197	Anything over 40 paid double wages rather than time and half which was common in states ! 
10306	2197	I was married . 
10307	2197	I wife was E-6 and WIFE earned about half what I did plus WIFE got housing etc. and we bought groceries in ASPECT_PX . 
10308	2197	Hell no wife did n't complain ! 
10309	2197	I liked money but I was miserable really but is about money eh ? 
10310	2197	However I call appalachian mountains I home and area is poverty central of ASPECT_USA . 
10311	2197	Today I do n't do iron work but if I did prevailing wage -LRB- what I would pay journeyman iron-workers on building with federal funds -RRB- here is about 20 dollars hour . 
10312	2197	In 80 80 was about 10-12 bucks hour . 
10313	2197	Anyway what I am saying is that we are too comfortable . 
10314	2197	trouble is that what happens here usually happens in rest of states in years and one cant buy job here . 
10315	2197	I owned small testing lab and had to sell LAB because not enough people was testing soil and I lost state contract for testing bodily fluids for dui cases etc. . 
10316	2197	So about three years ago I sold lab and used modest profits to throw I in church and two Christian humanitarian non profits I founded . 
10317	2197	I broke even year then bottom dropped out when economy tanked . 
10318	2197	Even with ASPECT_OBAMA in office federal grants dried up quicker than personal donations , so I was forced to close doors months ago to wait on better times after exhausting I bank account . 
10319	2197	Today I make ends meet on small insurance and interest off investments . 
10320	2197	Thank God house and land is paid for , and I am debt free ! 
10321	2197	But oh so tale is true and I hope and pray not coming to OH ` ra 
10322	2199	Hey poll actually reflects reality in case ! 
10323	2199	~ ra ~ 
10324	2200	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Of course . 
10325	2201	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- Is n't ASPECT_AMERICA great ? 
10326	2202	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- He IS dangerous to in ASPECT_AMERICA . 
10327	2202	I like ASPECT_AMERICA that way .

10329	2204	Do n't you know , I mow down elderly with shopping carts in grocery store parking lots -- just for kicks ! 
10330	2204	I do n't even have political motivations . 
10331	2204	What do you think about ? 
10332	2206	If obamalama was running unopposed by , ONE 'd write in rather than vote for `` great incompetent one . 
10333	2208	I dont know , but it sure should not be ASPECT_OBAMA , pitting one group of people against another ONE unheard of for leader ! 
10334	2209	What do you mean ? 
10335	2210	What quote meant was that he is dangerous to nation of ASPECT_USA . 
10337	2211	I hope he does not ever get whole in otitis media ... liike I Mom did ... WHOLE was treacherous ! 
10338	2212	He isnt danger to nation at all , rather to whole world , but is no different to past president since WW2 . 
10339	2213	Yes , because of patriotic love of country ! 
10341	2214	LOL Either you are retarded , cant read , or did n't read what I wrote . 
10342	2214	Which is either jollee , because what you just said is totally irrelevant to what I said . 
10343	2215	you ARE not justified ... . 
10344	2215	take LOOK AT YOURSELF ! 
10345	2216	What is not justified ? 
10346	2216	Oh and I look pretty -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- good when I 'm in mirror 
10347	2217	keep repeating yourself , YOU sound like IDIOT ! 
10349	2218	LOL Is that you have left ? 
10351	2218	So you have no argument left ? 
10352	2218	lol typical failure . 
10353	2219	Were you ever worth it ? 
10354	2219	No. ... Jollee 
10355	2220	Oh I 'm very worth it - I 'm quite expensive actually 
10356	2221	Keep making yourself feel like your ... jollee ha ha 
10357	2222	Are you jealous ASPECT_JOLLEE ? 
10359	2223	Ah old ear tube granuloma eh ? 
10360	2223	Bless ah heart . 
10361	2223	I dont wish harm to come to even ASPECT_OBAMA , I do wish they would just go away ! 
10363	2224	ASPECT_OBAMA is fine , you need to calm down about ASPECT_OBAMA . 
10364	2225	-RRB- -RRB- -RRB- I 'm part of nation and I ai n't dangerous to me . 
10365	2225	Maybe you should speak for yourself instead of trying to speak for 310,000,000 people , eh ? 
10366	2226	Another high maintenance , Me , ME , Me'er , Just what world needs great deal fewer of ! 
10367	2228	Interesting commentary and heavily weighed in `` southern philosophy , SOUTHERN suggest . 
10368	2228	SOUTHERN mostly grew up in `` south but southern higher education is midwest where SOUTHERN was taught `` how to think critically , not `` what to think critically , as southern youthful years outlined . 
10369	2228	SOUTHERN have summa cum laude degree in philosophy\/political science and 2 grad years in ASPECT_CHRISTIAN theology . 
10370	2228	foundation tells SOUTHERN that fundamental christian philosophy is grounded in socialist philosophy -- as nt book of Acts clearly demonstrates . 
10371	2228	of ASPECT_AMERICAN fundamental christian theology today is grounded in OT . 
10372	2228	It is implied Christians are now heir to OT promises of jewish wealth and favoritism because of faith and belief in `` christ known as ASPECT_JESUS . 
10373	2228	In point of fact -- if we cite king james version of `` bible -- `` apostle paul is father of ASPECT_CHRISTIAN philosophy inasmuch as it was JAMES who carried Christian philosophy to pagan world . 
10374	2228	Insofar as NT is concerned , it is not recorded that ASPECT_JESUS ever preached to others than jewish community . 
10375	2228	ASPECT_WALL_STREET going `` socialist ? 
10376	2228	Let SOUTHERN see . 
10377	2228	Just recently , it is reported that ASPECT_AMERICAN_BUSINESS has moved 40k factories to ASPECT_CHINA , leaving Americans without jobs . 
10378	2228	Then there 's ASPECT_WTO wherein rules governing trade supersede ASPECT_AMERICAN constitution in court of law . 
10379	2228	significant actions et . 
10380	2228	al. took place long before ASPECT_OBAMA became President ; and ASPECT_NAFTA and wall street deregulation took place under ASPECT_CLINTON , with blessing of neoconservative republicans who also pushed vigorously for war in ASPECT_IRAQ . 
10381	2228	One answer to conclusion : ASPECT_WTO !!!! 
10382	2228	SOUTHERN suggest you do hard-pressed `` goolging research to find fallacy in your opinion quoted above . 
10383	2228	ASPECT_HITLER would have killed Christian like ASPECT_OBAMA as ASPECT_HITLER did to Christians during hitler attempt to conquer industrialized world . 
10384	2228	SOUTHERN would seriously suggest that ASPECT_OBAMA is n't `` dumber than rock anymore than your implication suggests that you think your intellect is superior to ASPECT_OBAMA . 
10385	2228	`` God help SOUTHERN if poo really hits fan ? 
10386	2228	if we opinion reflects that by majority of voters in conservative , tea -lrb- `` stands for trouble -RRB- party republican led election . 
10387	2228	How about putting name to declaration ? 
10388	2228	Or link to source ? 
10389	2228	How about we americans just , like we conservative `` fraidy cats , stick CATS heads in sand and `` hide from rest of world ? 
10390	2228	How 's for abetting cats extinction ? 
10391	2230	My thoughts exactly ! 
10392	2230	Flounder said you remind him of MY ... MY can see why ! 
10393	2230	MY have agreed with everything you have said , and thought exactly way everytime . 
10394	2231	problem is they would never replace him , I imagine THEY would be too worried as to what THEY base would do . 
10395	2231	turn out for election would drop through floor PG . 
10396	2231	I liked ASPECT_CLINTON , she was wealth of experience . 
10397	2231	I may not often agree with SHE but besides being smart she has ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE . 
10398	2231	I think with ASPECT_OBAMA if ASPECT_CLINTON did not learn WEALTH in book ASPECT_CLINTON stumped , and ASPECT_CLINTON has ASPECT_CHICAGO approach to politics . 
10399	2231	Now if ASPECT_OBAMA_STEP down for good of party would be different , but for Democrat to challenge obama , , , would be out In I opinion ... Even though I am conservative , I think NOW shame if ASPECT_CLINTON never gets chance to run again . 
10400	2231	SHE is one of democratic icons left ... How Democrats took ASPECT_OBAMA over SHE I will never understand , , , ever . 
10401	2231	Personally I think it was set up ... Lets face one were never going to go with ASPECT_EDWARDS , knew about affair , and then when ASPECT_EDWARDS backed ASPECT_OBAMA it was pretty clear what was planned . 
10402	2231	Why would ASPECT_EDWARDS choose ASPECT_OBAMA over ASPECT_CLINTON ? 
10403	2231	Did ASPECT_EDWARDS honestly think ASPECT_EDWARDS was better choice ? 
10404	2231	experienced politicians would not agree with , not if POLITICIANS were thinking about good of country anyway . 
10405	2233	You jealous ? 
10406	2235	lol ... luckily MINORITY are small minority . 
10407	2237	One could only hope . 
10408	2237	He 's gonna get rid of ASPECT_IRS , what can dumb sheep want ? 
10410	2238	ASPECT_RON_PAUL is absolute legend . 
10411	2238	ASPECT_US , imho , would see ASPECT_US approval rating triple world wide if ASPECT_US elected ASPECT_PAUL . 
10412	2238	ASPECT_PAUL wants to disband empire -LRB- sell bases , disband cia etc -RRB- - and endorse capitalist policy -LRB- cut protectionism , cut taxes , cut subsidies , give back third world sovereignty etc -RRB- which would see paul presidency as one of best . 
10413	2239	Maybe I do need to lighten up bit on ASPECT_OBAMA . 
10414	2239	I have already much soften I views . 
10415	2239	I was especially critical of ASPECT_OBAMA_POLICY and ASPECT_OBAMA personally during year of ASPECT_OBAMA_PRESIDENCY . 
10416	2239	Lately ASPECT_OBAMA is trying to be more conservative , and ASPECT_OBAMA did not do harmful leftist things ASPECT_OBAMA promised ASPECT_OBAMA_SUPPORTER . 
10417	2239	OBAMA ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL or at least harmful socialist aspects of HEALTH will likely be repealed . 
10418	2239	I was worried about silence of moderately conservative americans thinking AMERICANS had been secretly abducted by ASPECT_OBAMA_ALIEN and lobotomized or brainwashed into believing that ASPECT_OBAMA was true messiah and could do no wrong ! 
10419	2239	-LRB- -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- attepted humor -LRB- -LRB- -LRB- . 
10420	2239	Anyway , I am now satisfied that there is backbone and brainwashing is wearing off . 
10421	2239	Everyone except for despicable god awful stomach turning pundits like ASPECT_KEITH ASPECT_OBERMAN and even less abrasive and easier on ears and stomach matthews has moderated in general citizenship . 
10422	2239	Still ASPECT_OBAMA is one of dangerous presidents and not Icon that majority of usa citizens beleive . 
10423	2239	I biggest concern is does president know PRESIDENT is harming and has harmed ? 
10424	2239	Or does president beleive that should really start down slippery slope to one-worldism , and national socialism ? 
10425	2239	If latter be true , then is is worse than dangerous president in history , ie abraham lincoln . 
10426	2239	Please , if I have offended by saying that about ASPECT_LINCOLN ask I why I think ASPECT_LINCOLN , who is loved by world and Americans , should n't be icon or even respected as upholder of Constitution etc. . 
10427	2239	I use lincoln often to drive home point so I thoughts are not meant to be flammable but rather educational . 
10429	2240	I would elect ASPECT_RON_PAUL NOW , except for -LRB- which I beleive NOW would agree to moderate -rrb- for of NOW proposed policies . 
10430	2240	I admire NOW for NOW position of isolationism of ASPECT_USA , but do n't think NOW goes far enough . 
10431	2240	I would work to win over western hemisphere . 
10432	2240	I like NOW position on taxes and as well . 
10433	2240	of now critics fear NOW polices would weaken ASPECT_USA . 
10434	2240	are short sited and naive imo . 
10435	2240	What is bringing us down and ASPECT_US bringing down rest of world , is us horrific debt , and expenditures , ie immoral mishandling of money money money ! 
10436	2240	ASPECT_US do n't need largest military etc , ASPECT_NO ASPECT_US do n't . 
10437	2240	I love I brothers in arms but let BROTHERS stay here at home . 
10438	2240	Without having to project power around world funding ASPECT_US military would be easy . 
10439	2240	Let nations sink or swim have aggressive neighbors . 
10440	2240	I would order that ASPECT_US train ASPECT_US allies then leave . 
10441	2240	extra funds and training time would be granted to have been loyal to ASPECT_US , Give ALLIES plenty of time , but in five years ASPECT_US would be gone ! 
10442	2240	War is not correct in situations morally nor is NOR ever right when NOR comes to economics . 
10443	2240	So even if former ally were attacked would not be reason to join in fight . 
10444	2240	demonstrable events of national self defense would warrant act of war . 
10445	2240	We would be far better off economically as isolated hemisphere or even nation . 
10447	2241	Not At Time ... . 
10448	2242	hi jollee . 
10449	2242	I thought THEM and couple of members might be angry -LRB- or worse saddened -rrb- with I about post . 
10450	2242	And remarks I made about ASPECT_LINCOLN in another thread . 
10451	2242	I gave THREAD thought before I posted MEMBERS and I did say that I would not elect ASPECT_RON_PAUL unless ASPECT_PAUL changed of paul ideas . 
10452	2242	Do n't worry I faith and I concern for I fellow man still rules I finger that pushes voting button ! 
10453	2242	If I do say sounds like I have taken leave of I senses please feel free to ask I here or PM I like to be honest . 
10455	2243	What position is ? 
10456	2243	Please elaborate . 
10457	2243	They would or rather weaken us hegemon , not ASPECT_US . 
10458	2243	ASPECT_US agree with totally . 
10459	2243	ron paul doe snot support economic isolationism - ASPECT_PAUL is totally opposed to SNOT . 
10460	2244	Why not ? 
10462	2245	Its crazy ... 
10463	2246	WHAT IS CRAZY ?! 
10464	2246	You realize I was agreeing with you ?! 
10465	2246	Can you even sustain relevant discussion for over two posts ?! 
10466	2247	Of course I can , what can I say , I would not vote for him at time ... Jollee 
10467	2248	What is crazy ? 
10468	2248	YOU said `` it is crazy - what is ? 
10469	2248	Also you said I think I like ASPECT_HITLER and what not - why ?! 
10470	2249	That you cant take simple answer ... Jollee 
10471	2250	I feel your intuition ... Jollee 
10472	2251	So what was answer ? 
10473	2252	I can reccommend education for you if your interested ... Jollee 
10474	2253	No stop avoiding question , or I 'll report STOP as insultWHY DID YOU SAY I LIKED ASPECT_HITLER ? 
10475	2254	Go back and read post , you have misinformed yourself ... Jollee 
10476	2255	You said to rev that you thought I might like ASPECT_HITLER - WHY ? 
10477	2256	Go back and read post , you have misinformed yourself ... jollee Jollee 
10478	2257	ASPECT_JOLLEE said ; Rev : I think ASPECT_MEGA appreciates ASPECT_STALIN , ASPECT_MARX , and or ASPECT_HITLER ... . 
10480	2257	WHY DID YOU SAY ? 
10481	2258	's simply my opinion ... Jollee 
10483	2259	So WHY DID YOU SAY IT ?! 
10484	2260	I do n't think Jollee was being malicious so whats problem ? 
10485	2260	PROBLEM obvious that you were attempting to flame I earlier and I did not report you , and I could have so I see no reason why you are threatening to report Jollee ... ra 
10486	2263	divorce is better idea than one YOU wife had for WIFE , big life insurance policy ! 
10487	2263	Ha ha YOU am just kidding YOU do n't have wife already tried twice ! 
10488	2263	HA as bad as YOU have ever seen HA and YOU have had to go from TN to AK to get job in past . 
10489	2263	If YOU were married and had kids ha would be tough , YOU sold YOU small business for operating capitol to get YOU very modest micro christian non profit humanitarian mission up and running when recession hit hard . 
10490	2263	Grants dried as did personal donations . 
10491	2263	mission -LRB- mountain manna mission -RRB- provided paralegal and assistant team for family to assist KIDS to access ASPECT_FEDERAL_AID and described what programs and resources kids were eligible for . 
10492	2263	-LRB- YOU staff\/employees numbered three including YOU ! -RRB- 
10495	2263	So yeah YOU emphasize with you , and good luck merc . 
10496	2263	YOU do not agree with affirmative action either . 
10497	2263	. 
10497	2263	time has come and gone . 
10498	2263	YOU think ASPECT_SINGLE_MOTHER should receive breaks but equivalently educated single woman should n't ASPECT_IMO . 
10500	2264	I ca n't believe you like ASPECT_RON_PAUL . 
10501	2264	ASPECT_PAUL is I dream candidate . 
10502	2264	I have no clue why people do n't endorse ASPECT_PAUL . 
10503	2264	You would think liberals that claim to be for `` freedom and liberty would love ASPECT_PAUL . 
10504	2267	I would vote for ASPECT_PALIN . 
10505	2267	She is so smeared by left that SHE must be doing for right , right \* ! 
10506	2267	I love SHE , she husband is lucky man . 
10507	2267	pun intendedra 
10508	2269	Will she make Sunday circuit ? 
10509	2269	Need to know about SHE than being moose shooter and cross hairs mapper . 
10511	2270	obamalama is just bull shooter and campaign mapper . 
10512	2271	is you will ever know if you listen to propaganda of left . 
10513	2271	have never ever in over thirty years of boob tubing and doing part for propaganda for ASPECT_UNCLE_SAM . 
10514	2271	No spy stuff just misinformation , leaflets etc. . 
10515	2271	was lucky to be REMF . 
10516	2271	Back in day psyops field operations were brutal and less sophisticated than today , no one raised fuss over torture , massacres , and PSYOPS had to be rather large to get in trouble over . 
10517	2271	Anyway , have always maintained that REMF could have had nomination if REMF had played remf cards right . 
10518	2271	Now , as of today with remf latest slip of tongue , TODAY will take good pr team and remf not making blunders if REMF wishes to run for presidential office in remf lifetime . 
10519	2271	Personally , do n't think REMF is interested . 
10520	2271	Even with professional pr team , bet team would take eight years to undo smears and character assassination levied against here by media and enemies . 
10521	2271	If were would give world finger and move to ASPECT_BUSH where HERE could get respite from goons that hound HERE . 
10523	2272	I also wonder about . 
10524	2272	man seems to be qualified , intelligent , and of unquestionable character . 
10525	2272	media ridicules man , calls MAN `` kook , but would seem to I that it is kooks who have gotten us into mess . 
10526	2272	who takes time to actually research man and man record can not help but admire MAN . 
10527	2272	MAN would certainly change things as president . 
10528	2272	Honesty , individual liberty , sound money , no entangling alliances foriegn policy . 
10529	2272	Ha , what concept . 
10530	2272	Come on people , stop listening to tv and pundits and do your research . 
10531	2272	future of your country is depending on you ! 
10534	2273	Interesting your `` mission was to inform families how to `` access ASPECT_FEDERAL_AID and describe what programs and resources your were eligible for . 
10535	2273	Is n't that contradiction to your `` conservative ideas , especially if you would like to see ASPECT_RON_PAUL win Presidency ? 
10536	2273	Philosophy is : If LIBERTARIAN are Libertarian , you can not -- repeat , `` can not '' believe or want government to help at anytime ! 
10537	2273	Not you . 
10538	2273	Not poor . 
10539	2273	Not young , incapacitated , old , or for reason . 
10540	2273	In ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN society , SOCIETY is survival of `` fittest meaning who can not fend for his\/herself is not fit to live in society . 
10541	2273	central government is required to do is protect shores from foreign invasion !!! 
10542	2273	's !!!!!!!! 
10543	2273	Course have to pay soldiers to do , which in point of fact , means SOLDIERS are mercenaries ! 
10544	2273	I agree with statement except to point out that women of color , religion , social\/economic status have been victims of dominate , power hungry , economic male society for millennia . 
10545	2273	Today , ASPECT_SA is well behind even emerging nations in regard ... 
10546	2274	I suppose that if I wanted to help person with college expenses or ASPECT_SINGLE_MOTHER with income , or help support otherwise incapable of supporting MOTHERS , I would like opportunity to pick and choose who and how I do it rather than send I money to ASPECT_WASHINGTON and have MOTHERS pick and choose . 
10547	2274	After MOTHERS have picked -LRB- stolen -RRB- cream off top . 
10548	2274	Without government nanny , people have ability to help others as OTHERS see fit and to spend others income as OTHERS see fit . 
10549	2274	I , for one , am positively sure that I can spend I money to better result than saviors in ASPECT_DC . 
10550	2275	Just comments about `` efficiency of ASPECT_MEDICARE and medicaid .1 . 
10551	2275	programs can only exist because they ` float ' on top of strong , for profit ' ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM . 
10552	2275	Without strong underlying system under reimbursing medicare\/medicaid programs would collapse .2 . 
10553	2275	How is `` efficiency achieved ? 
10554	2275	EFFICIENCY is achieved by contracting out to ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY , day to day administration of medicare\/medicaid claims . 
10555	2275	govt workers are NOT ones doing work . 
10557	2278	working person has ss account and pays premiums into account until retirement . 
10558	2278	ACCOUNT is labeled `` trust fund , but ACCOUNT is n't . 
10559	2278	If ASPECT_CONGRESS did not `` raid that `` trust in order to pay for items called `` discretionary , like bratboy ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS passing `` supplemental bills to fund 2 wars in ASPECT_IRAQ and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN , ss and medicare would be in black for not just baby boomers but boomers grand children . 
10560	2278	Correct again , which clearly shows medicare IS not government run or government takeover !!!!!!!!!!! 
10561	2278	ASPECT_ADMINISTRATION ASPECT_OF ASPECT_MEDICARE is `` bid contract just like government contract ; EXCEPT for example in case of bratboy ASPECT_BUSH campaign donor or crony -LRB- aka ASPECT_DICK cheney -RRB- like halliburton and blackwater . 
10562	2278	-LRB- Aside , off topic -RRB- Want to view fact filled info is sorely lacking on today media , CHEAPER recommend viewing , online , night frontline broadcast , `` Are CHEAPER safer ; flying cheaper ; Spy Who quit . 
10563	2278	Just for `` fraidy cat conservatives who are too willing to sacrifice again `` rights for old adage , `` CONSERVATIVES ca n't be too safe . 
10564	2278	Further note : CHEAPER totally disagree with afghan intelligence head who quit because EXCEPT wants Americans to stay in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN to win conservatives war for CONSERVATIVES . 
10565	2278	If Afghans want democracy , CONSERVATIVES will have to be willing to fight and sacrifice for afghans conservatives . 
10566	2278	AFGHANS is NOT job of Americans to fight for democracy anywhere but here on soil . 
10567	2279	First you say , and me quote : `` medicare program is one of efficient programs in history , even if one compares FIRST to `` private business . 
10568	2279	`` Then ME agree with YOU that it is efficient because FIRST is done by private insurance companies . 
10569	2279	And then ME go off on ASPECT_BUSH cheney rant about spending . 
10570	2279	Do me know worst spending of ASPECT_BUSH era came after jan 2007 ? 
10571	2279	AWFUL is fact ! 
10572	2279	jan 2007 is when ASPECT_DEMOCRATS took control of both ASPECT_HOUSE and ASPECT_SENATE . 
10573	2279	With spending included , eight years under ASPECT_BUSH saw national debt increase by 5 trillion dollars . 
10574	2279	ME want to say is AWFUL and YOU will totally agree with ME . 
10575	2279	Now YOU say that in just two years under obamalama OUR ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT has increased by 4 trillion dollars . 
10576	2279	YOU 'm old and not up on ` new math , ' so ME tell me which is worse . 
10577	2279	5 trillion over eight years -LRB- 625 billion per year average -rrb- , or 4 trillion over 2 years ? 
10578	2279	-LRB- 2 trillion per year average -RRB- But are in agreement that politicians of both parties have raided `` trust funds with regularity and impunity . 
10579	2280	2.7 billion dollars in welfare and medical benefits in one year payable in la county alone , where is your state ? 
10580	2280	Ready to b ail us out ? 
10581	2280	Villaregrosa , told illegal people ASPECT_VILLAREGROSA was sanctuary city when ASPECT_VILLAREGROSA went against ASPECT_ARIZONA , they all moved to ASPECT_CALIFORNIA ! 
10582	2280	Jollee , ASPECT_CALIFORNIA 
10583	2281	2.7 billion dollars in welfare and medical benefits in one year payable in la county alone , where is your state ? 
10584	2281	Ready to bail us out ? 
10585	2281	Villaregrosa , told illegal people ASPECT_VILLAREGROSA was sanctuary city when ASPECT_VILLAREGROSA went against ASPECT_ARIZONA , they all moved to ASPECT_CALIFORNIA ! 
10586	2281	Jollee , ASPECT_CALIFORNIA 
10587	2283	I did not stutter ... Jollee 
10588	2284	Not at . 
10589	2284	Just because ASPECT_PRIVATE_COMPANY gets contract does n't make company `` more efficient . 
10590	2284	government sets guidelines for product and company who wins contract . 
10591	2284	It is proved time and time again that `` waste in government contracts is propagated thru `` loopholes -LRB- which I showed in earlier post how lack of oversight can cost millions -RRB- . 
10592	2284	Why is ? 
10593	2284	Mostly because there are n't sufficient people in bureaucracy to check figure on invoice , especially , if there 's loophole not covered in contract . 
10594	2284	There is fraud in ASPECT_MEDICARE because , ASPECT_E.G. doctor commits fraud by using medicare accounts for procedures not done without patient knowledge . 
10595	2284	point I wanted to make about Bush\/Cheney is that money used for ASPECT_IRAQ and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN wars was NEVER included in Budget . 
10597	2284	wars were -LRB- note I say , `` WERE -RRB- paid for by supplemental appropriations passed by ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
10598	2284	bills are still being paid for in ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT . 
10599	2284	I do n't have time to `` check your figures and unless you can give I `` unbiased source for them , excuse I , if I doubt figures you quote are accurate or realistic . 
10600	2284	Yes , we do agree about raid on ss trust fund . 
10601	2284	RAID is shameful . 
10602	2284	Now you neoconservatives want to repeal NOW , taking away from people promise of dignity in old age people have paid for in lifetime of work . 
10603	2284	IOW , NEOCONSERVATIVES will NOT be getting what NEOCONSERVATIVES paid for .

10608	2285	ASPECT_BUSH over 3 trillion in ASPECT_FOX 4 years -------------- 2 years of which were under controlling majority of of ASPECT_CONGRESS by ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_PARTY . 
10609	2285	Or do you wish to argue that too ? 
10610	2285	simple net answers are : ASPECT_BUSH WAS bad . 
10611	2285	625 billion per year added to debt ! 
10612	2285	BHO is much , much , WORSE . 
10613	2285	2 trillion per year ADDED TO DEBT figures , in case , do n't lie . 
10615	2286	And , if one good came out of ASPECT_CARTER_PRESIDENCY , was followed by 12 years of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONTROL . 
10616	2287	ASPECT_REAGAN was one of better ones in modern history . 
10617	2288	One way could be helped is increase amount of Legal immigrants allowed per year . 
10618	2288	WAY would decrease lines to get in and would make way easier to come legally , possibly causing who come illegally to consider doing WAY right way ... 
10619	2289	If not best ... 
10620	2290	does not sound bad , however doubt it would slow illegal immigration and you would do is add to numbers . 
10621	2290	fellow on side who is waiting , does not want to wait period . 
10622	2290	just wont change . 
10623	2290	We have to stop giving people so much and thus make CHANGE less attractive , CHANGE way . 
10624	2290	Why people do not understand entitlements encourage greed and illegals just dont get . 
10625	2290	you are doing is saying . 
10627	2290	here take . 
10627	2290	free , and faster you get here faster you will have . 
10628	2290	Oh and if you leave baby your family will be welcome day . 
10630	2290	We have raped we constitution and we must straighten CONSTITUTION out , why is CONSTITUTION working for illegals and not WE ? 
10631	2290	Taking in will just increase numbers , because no matter your increase others will still be waiting . 
10632	2290	Not to mention WE will always get criminals . 
10633	2291	Not really . 
10634	2291	Now you switch topic from `` spending to `` debt . 
10635	2291	bolding emphasis is on `` spending to complement `` ideology . 
10636	2291	`` neoconservative republicans ALWAYS talk about `` less government , lower taxes , -LRB- and since ASPECT_REAGAN and majority ASPECT_REPUBLICAN ASPECT_CONGRESS during ASPECT_CLINTON -rrb- , about deregulation for big business and ASPECT_WALL_STREET . 
10637	2291	new here . 
10638	2291	Just about everyone shutters at rising debt ! 
10639	2291	REPUBLICANS tried to find where link is `` unbiased . 
10640	2291	There is no by-line as to who wrote article . 
10641	2291	However , ASPECT_BOLDING quote salient information as follows . 
10642	2291	`` ASPECT_BOLDING is mine to highlight disclaimer : ASPECT_BOLDING fail to see significance of link above . 
10643	2291	We can argue debt increase and INCREASE will likely increase year simply because dollar continues to be devalued . 
10644	2291	dollar value today is NOT value value was 50 years ago . 
10645	2291	`` Figures do n't lie , but liars can figure ! 
10646	2291	And , remember , ASPECT_OBAMA inherited ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_SPENDING_DEBT , including TARP , 2 wars and `` ASPECT_DONUT_HOLE . 
10647	2291	`` You say , ` Too may toe , ' ASPECT_OBAMA say , ` To Ma toe ' so , let call whole off . 
10648	2291	NEOCON 're neocon , ASPECT_BOLDING 'm independent . 
10649	2291	YOU will likely Never agree on ideology . 
10650	2291	BOLDING 'm protect `` people first '' person . 
10651	2291	're protect `` taxpayer person . 
10652	2291	BOLDING believe Constitution was written to protect people in aspects of national and international actionable relationships . 
10653	2291	BOLDING suspect you believe Constitution was written to protect aspects of national and international economic relationships . 
10654	2291	BOLDING do n't mind paying taxes protect and help people first . 
10655	2291	You do n't like paying tax does n't benefit you personally . 
10656	2291	In bolding view , majority of new tea party congress WO N'T give up people taxpayer funded ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE to put people `` benefits where ASPECT_PEOPLE_MOUTH is . 
10657	2291	bolding call that hypocrisy . 
10658	2292	is true . 
10660	2292	Tarp was passed prior to ASPECT_OBAMA_COMING in . 
10662	2292	and year is always due to past admin . 
10665	2292	there was almost unanimous agreement by both sides that markets had to be kept liquid . 
10666	2292	spending was in bag before ASPECT_OBAMA stepped in and SPENDING had to be done . 
10667	2292	ASPECT_GREENSPAN and cronies were to blame for creating estate bubble and not heeding warnings . 
10668	2292	ASPECT_OBAMA was handed keys to burning ship . 
10670	2292	and just before leaving gasoline was put on fire . 
10671	2292	fact that ship is still floating is amazing . 
10673	2292	but neither fire ... nor fact that ship is still floating has anything to do with ASPECT_OBAMA or democrats . 
10675	2292	EFFORT was completely bipartisan effort . 
10676	2292	Now that hurricane seems to be over . 
10678	2292	it is time to see what ASPECT_OBAMA is going to do . 
10679	2292	What is really disheartening are people that continue to do but bash side . 
10681	2292	just because EFFORT is side . 
10682	2292	Having no evidence or substantiation for claims made . 
10683	2292	We need solutions . 
10685	2292	not finger pointing by fools -LRB- fool being defined as make unsubstantiated accusations -RRB- 
10686	2293	If you care to go and find statistics , 2 wars are not that percentage of spending . 
10687	2293	ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING is part , but not `` 2 wars . 
10688	2293	And you are out and out liberal , NOT independent . 
10689	2293	If INDEPENDENT looks like liberal , and independent talks like liberal , and independent thinks like liberal , and independent smells like liberal , INDEPENDENT liberal . 
10690	2293	And , remember , ASPECT_OBAMA inherited ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_SPENDING_DEBT , including TARP , 2 wars and `` ASPECT_DONUT_HOLE . 
10691	2293	`` As ASPECT_OBAMA pointed out to you earlier , largest spending and increase in YOU debt in ASPECT_BUSH presidency was after jan 2007 when Democrats took control of of ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
10692	2293	spending and debt increase tripled ASPECT_BUSH previous 6 year average under Democrat control . 
10693	2293	And it was ASPECT_DEMOCRAT ASPECT_CONGRESS passed tarp . 
10694	2293	ASPECT_BUSH blame is in signing blame . 
10695	2293	as obamalama blame is in signing 4 trillion in debt increase by signing Democrat bills . 
10696	2293	ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT increased by 5 trillion dollars in 8 years under ASPECT_BUSH . 
10697	2293	60 of increase occurred in years 1 through 6 with ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CONGRESS . 
10698	2293	40 of increase occurred in years 7 and 8 under ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CONGRESS . 
10699	2293	As ASPECT_OBAMA constantly point out to YOU die hard liberal convictions , ASPECT_BUSH WAS bad . 
10700	2293	BHO is TIMES Worse . 
10701	2293	YOU projected increase in debt over 6 trillion in obamalama -LRB- and please , please , please , -RRB- term . 
10702	2293	TRILLION MORE than ASPECT_BUSH in HALF time . 
10703	2293	WHAT do YOU need to know ? 
10704	2294	I agree . 
10705	2294	It would lessen frustration of legals , but you are right , IT would most likely no decrease amounts of illegals . 
10706	2294	And fact that we make IT so appetizing is 100 correct . 
10707	2294	WE give LEGALS everything free and let LEGALS `` anchor babies . 
10708	2294	Fair tax nails we though ... 
10709	2296	ME are to label me `` liberal . 
10710	2296	CAPTAIN am NOT ! 
10711	2296	You have n't evidence of than CAPTAIN disagree with you !!!! 
10712	2296	Fact is , at one time in CAPTAIN youth , CAPTAIN was republican precinct captain , and of folk there tended to call FOLK `` conservative . 
10713	2296	But when ASPECT_REAGAN arrived on scene , was when CAPTAIN turned Independent and have been ever since . 
10714	2296	ASPECT_IMO , you are one that smells !!! 
10715	2296	with your inability to provide sources for your radical statements . 
10716	2296	You are just like neoconservative , fiscally irresponsible when INABILITY comes to `` spending people money and then whine and blubber -LRB- like neospeaker boehner -RRB- about deficit and debt . 
10717	2296	And , remember , ASPECT_OBAMA inherited ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_SPENDING_DEBT , including TARP , 2 wars and `` ASPECT_DONUT_HOLE . 
10718	2296	Your `` unbiased sources actually quote figures !!!!!! 
10719	2296	DEBT not captain job to confirm your figures . 
10720	2296	DEBT your job to do ! 
10721	2296	CAPTAIN am not your to help you prove your argument . 
10722	2296	CAPTAIN did find this -LRB- please note CAPTAIN DO PROVIDE AN UNBIASED SOURCE -RRB- : 
10723	2297	Since you wo n't accept us dept of ASPECT_TREASURY as source which you have link to examine figures , go ahead and use excuse you wish to use . 
10724	2297	From us treasuryus ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT at 3 months prior to obamalama inauguration :09 \ \/ 30\/2008 10,024,724,896,912.49 ASPECT_US national debt today : 14,071,897,000,000 . 
10725	2297	Difference 4 trillion , 47 billion . 
10726	2297	wars were `` off Budget by ASPECT_BUSH ? 
10727	2297	's your argument . 
10728	2297	is hilarious since EVERYTHING is `` off budget by grossly incompetent , world wide laughing stock , clown , obamalama since CLOWN does NOT have budget yet !!! 
10729	2298	You further need to note that THEM ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is stated in ASPECT_US dollars because DEBT is ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT . 
10730	2298	DEBT is not in dollars vs. currency . 
10731	2298	WE owe ASPECT_CHINA 1 Trillion united states dollars , THEM do not owe them or equivalent of trillion dollars in THEM money . 
10732	2298	So international value of dollar does not effect THEM ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT . 
10733	2298	What can effect THEM ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT is THEM inflation . 
10734	2298	And according to Democrats in power since jan 2007 until month , there has been no inflation . 
10735	2298	Since 2008 , -LRB- ASPECT_BUSH time -RRB- until now , according to them govt . 
10736	2298	there has been no inflation , so that receiving govt paychecks with cola factor , have not received increase since 2008 . 
10737	2298	So THEM national debt today is as if TODAY were stated in 2008 dollars . 
10738	2298	So go ahead and claim that national debt clock site is biased , go ahead and claim that us treasury is biased , and go ahead and claim that SITE inflation . 
10739	2298	Go ahead and keep your eyes and mind firmly closed to indisputable fact that gross ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA has blown 4 trillion dollars in 2 years and THEM have no robust economy , and no low unemployment , and no booming ASPECT_HOUSING_MARKET to show for absolute waste of 4 Trillion dollars . 
10740	2298	OBAMALAMA blames greed of ASPECT_WALL_STREET and banks for THEM financial woes and then defends bailing out wall street firms and banks . 
10741	2298	OBAMALAMA blames ASPECT_INSURANCE_COMPANY for unaffordability of ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and then champions bill VASTLY expands insurance companies markets ! 
10742	2298	Now OBAMALAMA is claiming to be business friendly and hires CEO of ASPECT_GE . 
10743	2298	company that finances obamalama propaganda and advertising networks of ASPECT_NBC ASPECT_AND ASPECT_MSNBC . 
10744	2298	ASPECT_US 'd vote for derelict living in packing crate before ASPECT_US 'd vote for idiot we have in ASPECT_DC now . 
10745	2299	CATS repeat : Figures do n't lie ! 
10746	2299	But , ASPECT_LIARS can figure . 
10747	2299	Everything you post shows your contempt for government , including YOU did and do vote for . 
10748	2299	Let CATS ask you : What or where would you be without government ? 
10749	2299	Probably dead or suffering because older you are , weaker you are . 
10750	2299	Even extraordinary wealth or amount of ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE you can purchase will not protect you from physical disability , disease , poor care or public disinterest . 
10751	2299	CATS repeat : Conservatives are `` fraidy cats and you are . 
10752	2299	You are as terrified of who do not pose threat as you are of who do . 
10753	2299	You think government is out to `` get CATS . 
10754	2299	In stead , you place your trust in free trade , wto , corporate greed and -- is true irony -- in amoral political party propagates wto self interest and survival over moral imperative intrinsic in Constitution : equal protection under law , human dignity and freedom from human misery . 
10755	2299	's exactly what cats thought you would do\/have done , and that `` idiot would still have concern for your well being than neoconservative pundit , congressperson , evil-spirited republican moron spouts lies over facts , reveres dollars over human beings and global corporations over governments ! 
10756	2299	PS : You still have n't provided `` source for your rhetoric . 
10757	2299	can twist figures from source and make beings `` work for imprecise conclusion . 
10758	2299	There are factors in simplistic `` debt numbers you use that `` mitigate outcome you insist upon -- as is clearly demonstrated in source cats quoted . 
10759	2299	But , people with closed minds to anything other than people personal dogma are incapable of understanding that , even when POINT is intrinsic point in argument ! 
10760	2300	You claim to be independent not liberal . 
10761	2300	Yet faced with indisputable facts you fall back on stereotypical liberal ploy of insulting intelligence of that disagree with your closed minded opinions . 
10762	2300	debt numbers are accurate , not put up by left or right political propagandist . 
10763	2300	Your inability to see truth is your burden to bear , not mine to share . 
10764	2300	I am against Governments that we have had LATELY . 
10765	2300	WE went from bad to WORSE . 
10766	2300	In past I 've put I life on line for we country , and we government , VOLUNTARILY ! 
10767	2300	And spent 60 days hospitalized after being air evacuated out to ASPECT_PHILIPPINES . 
10768	2300	What have YOU done for we country ? 
10769	2300	I am conservative independent and am tired of lying politicians of both sides . 
10770	2300	WE need who does understand what public service means and politicians WANT to actually SERVE public . 
10771	2300	Instead of lining politicians pockets and currying favors for when POLITICIANS leave public life . 
10772	2301	Just wanted to highlight idiocy in your post ... I can assure idiocy and insults are not confined to being liberal or conservative . 
10773	2301	I agree . 
10774	2301	I disagree . 
10775	2301	IDIOCY isnt worse , but IDIOCY isnt better 's for sure . 
10776	2301	Who cares , you did IDIOCY voluntarily , got paid and now brag - what ASPECT_HENRY calls `` remembering with advantages . 
10777	2301	Whilst I detest conservatives more than liberals , as libertarian I totally agree . 
10778	2301	Vote for ASPECT_RON_PAUL ! 
10779	2301	quality attributed to sides of ASPECT_WASHINGTON . 
10780	2301	By way , Liberalism IS not communism . 
10781	2301	In fact conservatives are simply another warped liberal group . 
10782	2302	I do n't know about you but I 've already seen enough . 
10783	2302	ASPECT_OBAMA is TOOL of corporate interests & ASPECT_WALL_STREET and TOOL of ASPECT_WASHINGTON warmongers . 
10784	2302	is enough for I . 
10785	2302	However , in keeping with topic of thread , I read interesting article on ASPECT_HUFFINGTON -LRB- which I try to avoid -RRB- titled : ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA -- Out of Closet and article ended with not too cryptic warning for ASPECT_OBAMA ; 
10786	2304	Thanx for posting your version of wackiness . 
10787	2306	You put word mission in quote brackets so LIBERTARIAN will clear that up for you ! 
10788	2306	ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN founded and own missions and church , but now they are owned by members who now have ASPECT_VESTED_INTEREST in participating in religious community as well as spiritual one ! 
10789	2306	Both missions -LRB- mountain manna mission , ie mmm and ASPECT_MISSION ASPECT_OF ASPECT_CROSSES ie mota -rrb- are christian humanitarian missions with bulk of mission going to assist clients with ASPECT_BASIC_NEED . 
10790	2306	church supports both with 501c status which OUR use as tax shelter etc. . 
10791	2306	members of church ie apocalyptic bearer Of cross church , a.b.o.t.c.c. actually stock in church and missions . 
10792	2306	is public record in carter county court house in carter county tn . 
10793	2306	Yes , huge mega contradiction , kind of . 
10794	2306	HUGE s true libertarian am libertarian and lean conservative concerning issues , but people are more complicated than labels that people employ to ID or describe others . 
10795	2306	LIBERTARIAN am no or but blend of and , as of us are . 
10796	2306	LIBERTARIAN resist socialism in cases . 
10797	2306	LIBERTARIAN don want to see black -LRB- white or green -rrb- third generation welfare mom ruining life and lives of MOM fourth generation welfare children . 
10798	2306	However due to mans inability to govern man , ASPECT_US have poverty , which produces citizens are unable to earn enough money to pay for basic humanitarian needs . 
10799	2306	In cases ASPECT_US should use ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE . 
10800	2306	Read above . 
10801	2306	With due respect , trust ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN libertarian was haunting halls of campus buildings \* long before you were , LIBERTARIAN suspect . 
10802	2306	MA , comparative religion\/theology Yes , ASPECT_US have opened ASPECT_PANDORA s Box and beheld brave new world sprang out and engulfed ASPECT_US in big bang of modernism before ASPECT_US could close -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- . 
10803	2306	problem is that ASPECT_US species have not learned how to live in society does not need dominate , power hungry , economic males , so there is square peg of males trying to fit in round hole of modern world . 
10804	2306	In fact , if you could imagine vast landscape of trillions of different shaped pegs trying to fit in trillions of different shaped holes , you would be imagining modern world as LIBERTARIAN see LANDSCAPE . 
10805	2306	pegs and holes are analogy for outdated and obsolete ideas and things in ASPECT_US world , trying to fit in reality of modern world , represented analogically as holes . 
10806	2306	Don fret , of nasty males have been dying off and bequeathing males wealth to males surviving widows , giving MALES power that MALES crave . 
10807	2306	As baby boomers age and die , process will accelerate for better or worse . 
10808	2306	Good for you , LIBERTARIAN understand your anger . 
10809	2306	Sorry you had issues , LIBERTARIAN had as well , which helps ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN understand . 
10810	2306	If you are speaking about ASPECT_OBAMA s toxic health care bill\/tax , ANGER has too problems . 
10811	2306	is mandatory requirement . 
10812	2306	LIBERTARIAN am not opposed to ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM subsidized by government if done right . 
10813	2306	ASPECT_OBAMA s ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE folly is example of how NOT to create ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_SYSTEM . 
10814	2306	LIBERTARIAN don really want to discuss medicare etc. except to say MEDICARE could have been self sufficient , and is prime requirement , fiscal balance . 
10815	2306	First LIBERTARIAN am of opinion that due to very effective character assassination by media , as well as by woman faults of not being pc libertarian wouldn t want WOMAN to run for president until time has passed say , eight years . 
10816	2306	If LIBERTARIAN were woman handler , LIBERTARIAN would have WOMAN stop making blunders and comments are non pc . 
10817	2306	Then LIBERTARIAN would groom WOMAN , for eight years , LIBERTARIAN guarantee at end of period woman would sweep election if conditions were as anti democrats as YEARS is now . 
10818	2306	WOMAN is highly intelligent woman -LRB- with IQ was estimated at 116 . 
10819	2306	Yes there was fabricated fraud iq test indicated score in 80s and IQ has been making internet rounds but IQ is fake and not validated -RRB- . 
10820	2306	WOMAN has impeccable moral and ethical standards , so LIBERTARIAN believe WOMAN would make great president . 
10821	2306	-LRB- blunders when viewed as running for president , has made no ethical or moral blunders ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN am aware of -RRB- statement is simply twaddle . 
10822	2306	can be just as easily be indicted as citizen as governor and we are still innocent until proven guilty , like MORAL or not . 
10823	2306	elected to quit governorship to pursue higher ASPECT_POLITICAL_OFFICE . 
10824	2306	Not to mention was giving up job that 99 of WE would kill for ! 
10825	2306	So actually made personal sacrifice by giving up desirable governess position ! 
10826	2306	too text 12,000 words to be cont . 
10827	2306	post ~ 
10828	2307	Continued ~ Her multi million dollar estate . 
10829	2307	Yes , what highly noble idea , ie to make money so ~ estate can care for child , instead of becoming burden on state . 
10830	2307	You see ms. sassy liberals would have aborted ~ challenged child for liberals convenience . 
10831	2307	Ah killing unborn for purely selfish reasons is to cherish and be admired for . 
10832	2307	No , kinds of abortions are natural crime called murder , and are beyond reprehensible . 
10833	2307	In contrast to liberal pro death politico would do i.e. ; -LRB- abort for convenience -RRB- , what ASPECT_PALIN did by keeping child which I.E. knew would need lifetime of care is so unselfish and beautiful , so morally and ethically correct , I would voted for i.e. nearly for reason alone ! 
10834	2307	And politico ramblings and \* cof opinions are ? 
10835	2307	Well wake up call ! 
10836	2307	You are doing very things you claim that members here are doing . 
10837	2307	Additionally , I would plead that you avoid making derogatory claims about who possess ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE and who doesn ! 
10838	2307	Again you may be accused of -LRB- lack of ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE -RRB- and CLAIM is too subjective claim . 
10839	2307	For example ; may think that FEMINIST are radical feminist holding festering grudge against white protestant males hoping to harm by making hysterical and transparent claims where you focus that festering beam of your rage in blanket fashion ensnaring that claim tidbit of libertarianism ? 
10840	2307	Hmm allow libertarianism infected white christian male to extend even repulsive -LRB- to extremely extreme liberals -RRB- bit of scriptural advice ? 
10841	2307	; matthew 7:5 hypocrite , first take beam out of your eye is not just religious practical information as well , PEOPLE would be better people if we studied and placed FIRST in practice . 
10842	2307	Yes of sources have to sell are not accurate and are fraudulent . 
10843	2307	I love net but material at library are better referenced validated and complete . 
10844	2307	I do agree that Godless secular school system has failed WE , and system time to take we schools back from liberal secular progressives . 
10845	2307	PROGRESSIVES have nearly destroyed we school system and harmed untold millions of students by spewing progressives doctrine . 
10846	2307	But 's material for another thread . 
10847	2307	Even we disagree nearly entirely I am happy to meet you and look forward to productive debate ~ ~ rr ~ 
10848	2308	Good for you JF . 
10849	2308	OBAMA have not always been so anti ASPECT_OBAMA . 
10850	2308	True , ASPECT_OBAMA have never been cheerleader for him . 
10851	2308	Nevertheless , by time HIM had won ASPECT_OBAMA had quasi optimistic attitude that maybe him would be good for country , despite very concerns over whom HIM may appoint for SCOTUS , and very important issues such as him record on late term abortion and abortion in general . 
10852	2308	Too bad him not only did not measure up him polices have brought ASPECT_USA to brink of collapse , in ASPECT_OBAMA_OPINION .

10857	2310	Had you said liberalism is not supposed to be like communism , I would agree with you . 
10858	2310	But liberalism today has been prostituted into communism . 
10859	2310	` Splain to I , in your unlimited wisdom , difference in 2 philosophies.com munism : From according to his ability , to according to EACH need ! 
10860	2310	Liberalism : Redistribute wealth . 
10861	2310	Both are saying , TAKE from who have earned WEALTH , and give wealth to who have n't earned WEALTH . 
10862	2311	difference is huge.Com munism takes everything primarily for benefit of state which redistributes equally . 
10863	2311	Liberals say that quid pro quo of benefits of capitalism is that you share of fabulous wealth you are allowed to generate and accumulate to provide safety nets for who for do n't have market value for ASPECT_BASIC_NEED . 
10864	2311	QUO always surprising to me how conservatives do n't understand basic economic concepts . 
10865	2312	I would and have said that governments are evil by default , and by degrees of evil . 
10866	2312	reason I say is because to be government government must govern i.e. control reason citizens .

10872	2316	Good for you mr jason .

10875	2319	Is figure based on ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT being permanently continued or being repealed ? 
10876	2321	If is what impresses you as awesome , you might want to consider forums like ASPECT_FREEREPUBLIC.COM or rightnation.com . 
10877	2321	forums are even more awesomely decidely against obama than one is . 
10878	2322	Meh , I like one , ONE worldly . 
10879	2322	Plus we outnumber Obamabots here by than 2 fold . 
10880	2322	than good enough for I . 
10881	2323	You want to give us reasons ? 
10882	2323	You always seem to have strong opinions on things , but you never give ASPECT_US reasons . 
10883	2324	Suit your self . 
10884	2324	You seemed more awesomely impressed with forum by how against ASPECT_OBAMA_FORUM is . 
10885	2325	501c -LRB- 3 -RRB- imo , `` religious organizations promote `` public welfare actually do n't . 
10886	2325	ORGANIZATIONS have `` mission . 
10887	2325	organizations `` mission is to directly or indirectly , intentionally influence receiver . 
10888	2325	overtly prostelytize using term , `` mission e.g. to show e.g. intent to convert to religious ideology . 
10889	2325	government in allowing tax exemption is promoting , underwriting and taking from profitable taxpayers and redistributing EXEMPTION to who are unprofitable . 
10890	2325	's socialistic concept seems complete contradiction to ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN philosophy as defined in Wikipedia : Which simply says , you studied `` religion not philosophy . 
10891	2325	There is world of difference as , e.g. physics uses Mathematics , but DISCIPLINE is scholastic discipline world apart in function . 
10892	2325	Philosophy is study of human activity through reason . 
10893	2325	Religion is study of human activity through `` faith , in spite of reason . 
10894	2325	RELIGION is interesting to note pre and baby boom ASPECT_AMERICAN `` males -LRB- of color -RRB- bridle when exposed to universal `` truth that women have been abused by males in , and probably before , recorded history . 
10895	2325	When ASPECT_BIRTH_CONTROL for women became affordable and available , modern women are now `` chooser of male will father `` her child . 
10896	2325	Thus , society has reverted to pre-religious concept of dominate gender which was female , as CONCEPT is with of natural selection . 
10897	2325	While FAN am not fan of -LRB- Three -RRB- witches of Endor : ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN , ASPECT_SHARRON_ANGLE , michelle bachman -LRB- sp -RRB- FAN think women leaders , on average , are better suited to govern with compassion , good sense and good will than men ; who are , on average , too quick to retaliate with force than with reason . 
10898	2325	ASPECT_JFK was notable exception when ASPECT_ENDOR decided , opposing endor military advisors , to not invade cuba ! 
10899	2325	Probably because ASPECT_ENDOR experienced hand futility of war . 
10900	2325	Not so with ASPECT_GWB , who along with ASPECT_DICK ASPECT_CHENEY -LRB- aka darth vader -RRB- managed to evade draft for viet nam . 
10901	2325	Neither were exposed to horrors of war but eager to send others to others death to secure oil fields of ASPECT_IRAQ . 
10902	2325	Neoconservatives are , above , obsessed with securing wealth over human misery . 
10903	2325	FAN recovered quickly from fan sense of `` injustice , not anger per se , and wrote recommendation for fan competitor , whom fan knew and liked . 
10904	2325	Today , THERAPIST is licensed therapist . 
10905	2325	fan sense of injustice goes to social hypocrisy that FAN had man to pay fan tuition when THERAPIST did not . 
10906	2325	In ideal world . 
10907	2325	But , life is not mathematic or ethical equation and never will be . 
10908	2325	So , why throw baby out with bath water ? 
10909	2325	WATER would seem from polls and pundits that no one was satisfied with bill that passed . 
10910	2325	BUT , if you agree that government CAN handle national health care -- which BUT has done successfully in ASPECT_MEDICARE and veterans health care for decades -- then why not ASPECT_PUBLIC_OPTION puts net over ASPECT_INSURANCE_INDUSTRY to `` play fair ? 
10911	2325	Plus , if ASPECT_INCOME_TAX and SS is mandatory , why is ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE not constitutional ? 
10912	2325	Especially , if TAX is designed for public good ? 
10913	2325	TAX collects from who receive `` income , not just for who can afford out-of-control premiums . 
10914	2325	You may be sincere here , but your `` insight into woman and joan ambitions is flawed and without strong foundation . 
10915	2325	ASPECT_JOAN is n't ASPECT_JOAN of Arc or mother theresa . 
10916	2325	JOAN opportunistic fraud . 
10917	2325	action JOAN taken is prime example of self centered wealth based ambition . 
10918	2325	people can be self-educated , but ASPECT_JOAN does n't even read newspapers . 
10919	2325	ASPECT_JOAN has skill with `` quip but tina fey characterization of ASPECT_PALIN as beauty pageant candidate is spot on . 
10920	2325	If ASPECT_JOAN were blonde , ASPECT_JOAN 'd be called `` dumb blonde . 
10921	2325	`` Go to page 2 for response to rest of your post . 
10922	2326	I know , it 's great 
10923	2327	is conclusion solely based on your Christian ideology . 
10924	2327	Yes , ASPECT_PALIN , at point in time can well afford to care for her disabled child . 
10925	2327	But , CHILD is n't `` relying on Lord to provide care as of of Christian faith expect woman to do . 
10926	2327	anti-abortion advocates will encourage and even aid CHILD to CHILD decision to birth baby , but CHILD 's on CHILD after . 
10927	2327	Hardly `` christian to do . 
10928	2327	Nor are ADVOCATES willing to `` adopt child to raise , educate until it is able to survive on . 
10929	2327	No , no let `` government do . 
10931	2327	Is n't case of pot calling kettle ASPECT_BLACK ? 
10932	2327	May suggest you honor your judgment applied to SOME . 
10933	2327	agree , `` libraries are better than others . 
10934	2327	's true of sources on internet as well . 
10935	2327	But , who can use computer can save time by using COMPUTER and internet to research and learn . 
10936	2327	COMPUTER is tool . 
10937	2327	COMPUTER can be weapon . 
10938	2327	Like man made tools , computer best used with caution , reason and intelligence . 
10939	2328	Care to expand on statement MD ? 
10940	2328	I am speaking of sentence . 
10941	2328	~ rr ~ Perhaps ~ will answer from his\/her understanding , but I 've heard before where Neoconservatism can be summed up pretty as follows : Borrow and spend because deficits do n't matter ! 
10942	2329	Once again for your enjoyment `` From day of ASPECT_GEORGE_WASHINGTON Presidency through day of ASPECT_BILL_CLINTON Presidency , YOUR racked up of 5 trillion dollars of ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT . 
10943	2329	was too spending ! 
10944	2329	Then ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH took over , and increased ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT from 5 trillion left by ASPECT_CLINTON , to 10 trillion at end of ASPECT_BUSH 8 years . 
10945	2329	ASPECT_BUSH , in 8 years , equaled OVERspending by Presidents before ASPECT_BUSH . 
10946	2329	is terrible . 
10947	2329	Then obamalama comes in in jan 2009 with ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT of 10 trillion . 
10948	2329	Now NOW jan 2011 , two years later , and ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT stands at 14 trillion . 
10949	2329	In 2 years 2 has equaled 80 of awful amount ASPECT_BUSH spent , and also equaled 80 of Presidents combined from ASPECT_CLINTON back to ASPECT_WASHINGTON . 
10950	2329	Congressional Budget office -LRB- CBO -RRB- projects ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT will be 18 trillion at end of 2015 . 
10951	2329	Not fox , not Republicans , but ASPECT_CBO . 
10952	2329	And ASPECT_CBO is projecting because of `` proposed spending reductions . 
10953	2329	mathematical projection at today rate of spending is 22 trillion of ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT by end of 2015 . 
10954	2329	22,000,000,000,000.002015 And what did obamalama choose to talk about in ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_STATE of union campaign speech ? 
10955	2329	` Investments ! ' 
10956	2329	means Govt spending , when we have only little less than 00.60 cents for dollar WE are spending . 
10957	2329	Meaning , dollar WE spend , WE have to borrow bit over 00.40 cents . 
10958	2329	How hard could MEANING be to find can do better than incompetent clown ? 
10959	2330	ME am happy you spread blame where BLAME belongs , is not partisan issue , BLAME survival issue ! 
10960	2330	said , is n't debt terrifying ? 
10961	2330	ME mean DEBT absoultely horrifying ! 
10962	2330	or maybe of me virtual and regular friends think ME am bit eccentric as ME build ME new home\/office to double as ` bug out ' shelter of sorts . 
10963	2330	building -LRB- Church and mission offices -RRB- and despite is fully off grid capable , self sufficient in electrical power , including heating and cooling and can support two adults for over year without restocking . 
10964	2330	ME am not nut but rather simply endowed with inability to stick me head in sand , and perhaps more important me am blessed with normal dose of ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE . 
10965	2330	NUT 's obvious me that we can not sustain anywhere near level of spending that WE seem to think is normal ! 
10966	2330	ME would urge everyone get prepared with survival plan and options should worst happen . 
10967	2330	God bless of you . 
10968	2330	~ rr ~ 
10969	2331	You are welcome here ! 
10970	2331	Great minds think alike ! 
10971	2331	~ rr ~ 
10972	2332	Yes I agree . 
10973	2332	BTW I will reply to your rebuttal asap . 
10974	2332	I need coupld hours to nod ~ rr ~ 
10975	2333	hi sassy , LIBERTARIAN did n't have time to edit for grammar so LIBERTARIAN hope THING Legible ! 
10976	2333	LIBERTARIAN am so very aware of falsehood and FALSEHOOD simply paranoia often and , with due respect falsehood &#8217; s rank falsehood . 
10977	2333	LIBERTARIAN have heard FALSEHOOD so often LIBERTARIAN know where you are going with . 
10978	2333	Even if recipients of theistic giving receives huge dose of religion with goodies , RECIPIENTS still definitely are getting assistance etc ! 
10979	2333	Your logic is so fallible in statement that LIBERTARIAN nearly didn &#8217; read rest of your reply , except to give cursory glance and dumbed down reply . 
10980	2333	However LIBERTARIAN took chance that you were not being totally malicious and decided to give your reply benefit of doubt and LIBERTARIAN am happy libertarian did , because you made good points . 
10981	2333	Well school children know that Christian missionaries are umm &#8217; &#8230; . 
10982	2333	Christian missionaries ! 
10983	2333	&#8230; &#8217; s not like S are going to get ambushed , or given small pox infected blankets along with what would ASPECT_JESUS do \ \/ love your fellow man tract ! 
10984	2333	is repetitively harped message &#8230; would be comical sassy ! 
10985	2333	If ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN offer assistance by LIBERTARIAN missions yes ASPECT_LIBERTARIAN may exposed to awful things including but not limited seeing bible on LIBERTARIAN desk or bit of scripture on walls . 
10986	2333	You may even be asked to come to church , however you wont be bushwhacked from out of blue ! 
10987	2333	comes to church knows that they just might be exposed to jesus stuff ! 
10988	2333	good news is -LRB- in addition to scripture -rrb- that secular organizations will charge cash for organizations services or food etc. . 
10989	2333	If you have no cash you will starve or be denied services . 
10990	2333	However , clients will not be turned away unless CLIENTS are danger to CLIENTS or staff . 
10991	2333	-LRB- when LIBERTARIAN was up and running -RRB- . 
10992	2333	Yes indeedy ! 
10993	2333	Giving stuff away is unprofitable ! 
10994	2333	And you are failing again in your logic . 
10995	2333	taxpayers pay taxes , not just profitable taxpayers , ha ha . 
10997	2333	However LIBERTARIAN will say that missions could be seen endeavor in socialism . 
10998	2333	&#8217; s given eh ? 
10999	2333	In fact ASPECT_JESUS would be communist if JESUS were alive today . 
11000	2333	However LIBERTARIAN already replied to your concerns . 
11001	2333	LIBERTARIAN said that LIBERTARIAN am not libertarian in respect , LIBERTARIAN went to pains to point that out . 
11002	2333	LIBERTARIAN believe that because of perversion of society which was accomplished by embracing paradigm of progressive liberalism and by accepting logical positivism -LRB- over metaphysics -RRB- we are forced to adopt tenets of socialism . 
11003	2333	early church was form of socialism . 
11004	2333	LIBERTARIAN have never said socialism is bad have LIBERTARIAN ? 
11005	2333	There is no black and white in anything in temporal universe , -LRB- ie we tangible universe -rrb- . 
11006	2333	Trust libertarian , everything resides in shades of black and white , is provable to accuracy of 100 . 
11007	2333	-LRB- is not straw man claim but claim &#8217; s close due to godel universes and beautifully strange way quantum world behaves due to uncertainty and non-locality etc. -RRB- You must know that if you earn MA in theology you have semester hours in philosophy than in nearly field . 
11008	2333	LIBERTARIAN have and LIBERTARIAN do . 
11009	2333	You should not make claims in public forum sassy . 
11010	2333	Again not things are black and white . 
11011	2333	Personally LIBERTARIAN think you may should allow yourself to accept anything given freely without guilt and or anger . 
11012	2333	We agree again . 
11013	2333	If WE could know 100 of variables in precise moment of calculation we could know everything about anything , and not even God can or chooses to know that about universe . 
11014	2333	And without going off topic moment that very concept that God chooses not to know or likely can not know to accuracy of 100 variables constitutes universe gives we free will . 
11015	2333	You bring up good points . 
11016	2333	Personally , LIBERTARIAN believe ASPECT_IRS and taxes , including ASPECT_INCOME_TAX are illegal ! 
11017	2333	Adding another wrong to bath water ie ASPECT_OBAMA_HEALTH_CARE_BABY_DOLL only reinforces bad behavior . 
11018	2333	So LIBERTARIAN say that yes , we should throw dead baby doll out with bath water ! 
11019	2333	lastly libertarian should say that having to pay taxes etc isn &#8217; t as being forced to buy PRODUCT . 
11020	2333	reasons come to mind not least being that ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE may not stand up to constitutional muster ! 
11021	2333	Well you must understand that when LIBERTARIAN read her bio libertarian saw woman more accomplished that . 
11022	2333	HER is much more accomplished than of that criticizes -LRB- LIBERTARIAN should say crucifies her -rrb- . 
11023	2333	Additionally , LIBERTARIAN highly admire her moral values ie her christianity etc. . 
11024	2333	Of course people would write HER off precisely because HER is Christian and is pro life . 
11025	2333	pro choice do not really understand or believe pro life people and is shame , but that in and of OF is another thread -LRB- abortion , morals etc -RRB- ra 
11026	2334	You certainly have queer ideas about christians sassy ! 
11027	2334	Christians consider lord grants station in life . 
11028	2334	do n't thinking that God will provide only after death but 's not what scripture tells . 
11029	2334	YOU think that maybe you ought to brush up on Christian faith if you plan to debate subjects deal with theology , particularly Christianity . 
11030	2334	Again , you are very wrong about as well . 
11031	2334	There are Christian support groups than secular groups , additionally church would support her at least GROUPS would in cases . 
11032	2334	YOU church is not true church , as YOU do not preach except as in guest capacity . 
11033	2334	However , church of YOU youth has provided for members that fell upon hard times , as ` biker ' church that YOU regularly attend . 
11034	2334	Ummm ' you goggled for Christian free services for mentally handicapped disabled children and received so hits that YOU could not fit CHILDREN on page . 
11035	2334	Therefore , YOU tried pasting CHILDREN to word processor document and received error message saying listings exceeded capability of ASPECT_WP ! 
11036	2334	YOU guess rather shoots your claims down . 
11037	2334	Next YOU Goggled atheist organizations offered free services for children etc etc. . 
11038	2334	YOU could fit of them on ... ummm ... on ... ahhh ' matchbook cover ! 
11039	2334	You are assuming that mother does not take child ! 
11040	2334	Ha ha in fact you are so off base that YOU am beginning to wonder what your agenda is . 
11041	2334	sad fact of matter is that YOU think you really think claims are true . 
11042	2334	YOU am astonished that so disinformation\/propaganda exists . 
11043	2334	Apparently , successful propaganda has convinced normally intelligent people like yourself that lies are truth . 
11044	2334	YOU do . 
11045	2334	Where have YOU been to come out of blue and wrongly accuse you of anything ? 
11046	2334	Well yes you are correct , YOU use computer too much simply take YOU chances . 
11047	2334	So , we can agree on items , which is good indicator that WE can discuss issues without argument or discussion becoming toxic . 
11048	2334	biggest criticism YOU have of your replies is that you made quite non-sourced and unsubstantiated claims , which were reworded are old atheist standbys or worse , however even worst ones have n't damaged your credibility . 
11049	2334	YOU know that you have criticisms for YOU as well ! 
11051	2335	Right now interest on debt is at historically and ridiculously low levels . 
11052	2335	Lucky for . 
11053	2335	eu countries have gone beyond terrible debt levels are now paying OVER 11 on debt . 
11054	2335	While 5 t0 8 would be normal interest rate for to be paying , is not present case . 
11055	2335	But imagine if were paying 7 on debt . 
11056	2335	NOT unusually high rate .7 14 trillion = 980,000,000,000.00 . 
11057	2335	980 billion dollars interest . 
11058	2335	than Medicare\/Medicaid . 
11059	2335	than ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY . 
11060	2335	than ASPECT_DEFENSE ASPECT_DEPT. . 
11061	2335	Even at very low rate of interest , interest amount is single largest expense have NOW ! 
11062	2335	While m\/m or ss or DD are higher totals , they are covering multiple agencies\/depts . 
11063	2335	and multiple programs . 
11064	2335	Interest is single line , and already highest single line . 
11065	2336	Well you will read detailed report , but basically REPORT eliminates avoidable taxes -LRB- well none should be avoidable , but ... -RRB- one tax they ca n't avoid is ASPECT_SALE_TAX because THEY have to buy things . 
11066	2336	I mean ASPECT_WAL-MART would be one of best examples of where THEY would HAVE to pay taxes . 
11067	2336	ASPECT_SALE_TAX would be possibly shockingly high , around 30 if I 'm not mistaken -LRB- gotta check that -RRB- and tax would , in theory make up for lost taxes . 
11068	2336	Ca n't avoid ASPECT_SALE_TAX or else you have no food , clothes , technology , cosmetics , etc. ... 
11069	2337	If one pays taxes , one is deemed `` profitable , because they have income over expenses . 
11070	2337	`` Non-profit means exactly , `` no income over expenses . 
11071	2337	If you do , you pay tax or get `` tax credit that `` forgives overage up to certain amount . 
11072	2337	I do n't disagree with your posit . 
11073	2337	NO idea is concrete . 
11074	2337	And , 's very foundation of philosophy . 
11075	2337	What seems to be , just may not be . 
11076	2337	's also foundation of scientific theory and why theory must be replicated over and over before it is justified to be used as matter of fact . 
11077	2337	Except `` religion is basis for study . 
11078	2337	Why not ? 
11079	2337	Not necessarily `` capable just `` aware of how hard just is to grow and bear child and then lose life of child to is avoidable . 
11080	2337	Children are priority for women . 
11081	2337	I do n't think majority of men think way , tho ' I 'm also sure do . 
11082	2337	I do not presume to know what god thinks , chooses to know or not know . 
11083	2337	I do take for I personal philosophy teachings found in NT . 
11084	2337	I believe inhumanity of humanity toward humanity is barbaric , founded in perverted , distorted prime imperative `` to survive . 
11085	2337	Human beings have intellectual ability to `` see beyond selfish , egocentric instincts and can reason together to achieve `` win-win goal for public good . 
11086	2340	True that . 
11087	2340	consumers tax . 
11088	2340	No taxes on anything else except consumer goods . 
11089	2340	Have you found links to support 30 figure . 
11090	2340	I 'd be interested in reading . 
11091	2341	Imagine that programs you pay taxes to support were to become voluntary . 
11092	2341	In words , instead of sending money to mongrels through threat of prosecution , you decide what programs you want to support and how money that you want to send to support MONGRELS . 
11093	2341	idea being that you are careful spending your money than politicians are . 
11094	2341	result would be next to no spending by fed gov outside of defense and infusion of your cash locally . 
11095	2341	is very simplified version of what ASPECT_RON_PAUL has been saying for thirty years . 
11096	2341	To learn very detailed version , go to paul website -LRB- there are -RRB- . 
11097	2341	Fair tax , consumer tax , etc. are just different names for . 
11098	2341	pols will not turn loose of money if you do n't make POLS . 
11099	2341	Check LOOSE out . 
11100	2341	You having control of your income - what novel idea . 
11102	2341	I would like to try CRAZY and see . 
11103	2343	Have n't had too time . 
11104	2343	Will try by tomorrow . 
11105	2344	No way ! 
11106	2344	still after two years and being active democrat , I will not vote for DEMOCRAT ! 
11108	2346	Interesting figures . 
11109	2346	Scary figures . 
11110	2346	What would happen if WE -LRB- usa -rrb- said ` no we will not pay ASPECT_WE_DEBT off ? ' 
11111	2346	And that ` and attempt to collect payment will result in war ! 
11113	2347	You were -LRB- are -RRB- democrat ? 
11114	2347	ha ha 's ok Jollee , YOU vote issues -LRB- and not party line -rrb- as well . 
11116	2349	I sincerely hope that ASPECT_PALIN does not run . 
11117	2349	She does best staying on sidelines and annoying libs . 
11118	2350	move would require that we immediately cut federal and state spending by TRILLIONS of dollars since WE would no longer be able to borrow money at rate . 
11119	2350	Might be worth try !!! 
11120	2350	Also would result in recall or impeachment movements since bulk of ASPECT_WE_DEBT is owed to ASPECT_US citizens . 
11121	2352	How about billy club ??? 
11122	2353	Not even `` billy beer . 
11123	2354	would go unfunded would be ASPECT_DEPARTMENT ASPECT_OF ASPECT_DEFENSE ! 
11124	2355	Not that are so stupid to think world is filled with nice people . 
11125	2355	30 minute study of world history would tell you that ASPECT_DOD is one of vital departments we have . 
11126	2355	cuts might need to be made , but ASPECT_DOD is essential to we survival as country and just as people . 
11127	2356	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.fairtax.org \ \/ site\/News2 ? 
11127	2356	ne ... rticle & id = 8248Turns out RATE 's less than I thought : RATE would be 23 ASPECT_TAX_RATE , not 30 rate . 
11128	2356	Even better ! 
11129	2357	I 'm exploring that website now . 
11130	2357	Enlightening reading so far . 
11131	2358	I have shirt similar to of your photo i.d. Mine says about border control and is relevant to yours 
11132	2360	SHOULD not be is word . 
11133	2360	Will he NOT be ? 
11134	2360	's hard to discern at point . 
11135	2361	True , we must maintain ASPECT_DOD to defend WE . 
11136	2361	But what would be difference in costs of defending ASPECT_USA versus ASPECT_AMERICAN empire . 
11137	2361	costs would be in international corporate profits ie haliburton ! 
11139	2363	I certainly hope that ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC will not be incredibly stupid again . 
11140	2363	And ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE ? 
11141	2363	far in advance of 2008 elections , obamalama was NOT democratic possibility . 
11142	2363	There is still time for candidate , not yet considered possibility , to emerge . 
11143	2363	ASPECT_BHO did . 
11144	2363	And imagine difference if obamalama has to run against STRONG candidate , is neither old nor carrying ASPECT_BUSH baggage . 
11145	2363	Whomever was ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC_CANDIDATE in 2008 was walkover . 
11146	2363	BHO had to beat woman , 's . 
11147	2363	All Democrats shot themselves in foot . 
11148	2363	And ASPECT_MCCAIN was ASPECT_SACRIFICIAL_LAMB . 
11149	2363	Now obamalama will have to overcome OBAMALAMA failed policies and incredible debt ever run up by president ever . 
11150	2363	OBAMALAMA is one will be dragging baggage coming election . 
11151	2363	And 2 years from now , ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_BULLCRAP of 2 years will be even more revealed than YEARS is now . 
11152	2364	I find it funny how libs bash ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT . 
11154	2364	They stand for Constitutional government , and are against big , wasteful government . 
11155	2364	THEY are Conservative movement . 
11156	2364	Everyone should be behind THEY . 
11157	2365	of us are against deficits and like fact ASPECT_US do n't have hordes of aged , infirm and temporarily out of luck living under freeways begging at stoplights . 
11158	2366	DEM consider you one of informed people on right so DEM will not insult your intelligence . 
11159	2366	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY has good idea about getting ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_SPENDING under control , -LRB- you know DEM am dem -rrb- . 
11160	2366	But , like DEM can not join organization has racist overtones . 
11161	2366	DEM do not believe ASPECT_TEA_PARTIER are racist , but accusation continues to be made , and ASPECT_TEA_PARTY has not rejected PARTY with vigor . 
11162	2366	ACCUSATION takes is one picture like , and tea party credibility is gone for lot of people . 
11163	2366	So , for like DEM ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is write-off . 
11164	2367	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA was elected by maj. . 
11166	2367	major ... majori . 
11167	2367	. 
11167	2367	had votes ! 
11168	2367	When you wish upon star ... ... Dream on . 
11169	2370	things can kill ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY . 
11170	2370	And yes , Democrats experienced set back . 
11171	2370	Time will show that unloading `` blue dems was good because it is easier to target Republicans outside party than TIME is to have internal struggle . 
11172	2370	Fact is ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY does not even have contender for President . 
11173	2370	ASPECT_ROMNEY , ASPECT_PALIN , ASPECT_GINGRICH , ASPECT_HUCKABY favorites of conservative ASPECT_REPUBLICAN base . 
11174	2370	In end Republicans will be smart enough not to nominate of them . 
11175	2370	If ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA refused to run we have plethoria of qualified candidates , ASPECT_CLINTON , ASPECT_BIDEN , ASPECT_REID , ASPECT_PELOSI , and my favorite new face , ASPECT_ANTHONY ASPECT_WEINER . 
11176	2370	Democrats have end game . 
11178	2371	im not happy with of candidates ... though from what ive heard of aw i might consider AW ... BO will run again though ... I hope for ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE who is at least worthy challenger ... We shall see come election 2012 
11179	2373	Quite frankly , I have seen racist . 
11180	2373	`` Do n't tax dude bro was take on line drunk dude said to cop , `` Do n't taze dude bro . 
11181	2373	tea party-racism link is non-existent , and has yet to be proven . 
11182	2373	There are wackos in group , but WACKOS do not represent group . 
11183	2374	Are you for Constitutional government ? 
11184	2375	You crack me up . 
11185	2375	What flame-baiter ! 
11186	2376	ASPECT_LIBERAL sop , play ASPECT_RACE_CARD . 
11187	2376	photo comes from not just liberal site but progressive site . 
11188	2376	site demeans ASPECT_TEA_PARTY in way PHOTO can . 
11189	2376	And photo is from 3\/2010 or earlier . 
11190	2376	various tea party groups have denied racism and then liberal media delights in calling groups liars . 
11191	2376	However ASPECT_TEA_PARTY spoke loud enough for independents to hear in nov. 2010 . 
11192	2376	Liberals can not hear as LIBERALS are brainwashed into deafness and blindness . 
11193	2376	But ASPECT_VAST_MAJORITY of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC do not suffer from liberal looniness . 
11194	2376	And where does photo originate ? 
11195	2376	ASPECT_AP , ASPECT_NY_TIME ? 
11196	2376	ASPECT_FOX , ASPECT_CNN ? 
11197	2376	No FOX originates with progressive site fox posted on . 
11198	2376	, supposedly , racist tea party photos have been shown to be STAGED 
11199	2378	Even that one is based on guy said , `` Do n't taze guy bro , to white police officer . 
11200	2379	You seem to be bit sensitive ... I have not seen racism with ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_PEOPLE , PEOPLE seem like good group of people to I , people who have taken undo criticism ... GROUP actually sickening to see administration talk negative of PEOPLE , GROUP disappointing ... Jollee 
11201	2381	He was lying way back when HE was campaigning , wish people had listened to HE more carefully ... We would be in allot better shape now ... 
11202	2383	Where were you guys in 2001 , or 2003 , when government was squandering budget surplus and running up deficits with ASPECT_TAX_CUT ? 
11203	2383	But I agree ASPECT_OBAMA has been not aggressive enough on issue . 
11204	2383	With country coming out of recession , it was mistake to cave to Republicans and let ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT run another two years , which will push back meaningful progress on deficits . 
11205	2383	ASPECT_OBAMA should also let ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT expire completely , and at 5-10 surcharge on incomes over 1m to help redress damage ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT have caused , as well as trim spending . 
11206	2384	Great bit of facts . 
11207	2384	Always wanted to know details , but never looked them up ... I would do one of recommend credit things but I have no clue how ... know how ? 
11208	2385	Tell you what . 
11209	2385	You seem to be having problem understanding what thread is about , and my statements . 
11210	2385	So MY 'll dumb problem down for you . 
11211	2385	word here is `` PERCEPTION . 
11212	2385	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is `` PERCEIVED racist by people who might otherwise be interested in what they have to say . 
11213	2385	You want to argue picture or picture . 
11214	2385	Well , ASPECT_GOOGLE `` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , Racist , you will find no less than 1,980,000 web sites discuss problem ! 
11215	2385	would agree that web sites on subject indicates problem . 
11216	2385	Here is link . 
11217	2385	http : \ \/ \ \/ www.google.com \ \/ #sclient = psy & h. . 
11217	2385	.83 dfe782e20cdc now are you ready to discuss obvious problem or racism in ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , or are you going to continue to ignore reality ? 
11218	2385	tea party leader , ASPECT_DALE ASPECT_ROBERTSON http : \ \/ \ \/ www.mediaite.com \ \/ online\/tea-p ... r-n-word-sign \ \/ http : \ \/ \ \/ www.youtube.com \ \/ thegrammys ? 
11218	2385	feature = tickerit is really easy to go with ASPECT_BILL_MAHER on issue . 
11219	2385	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY has public relations night mare , and PARTY will bring them down as racist . 
11220	2387	And now I 'll dumb now down for you . 
11221	2387	liberals percieve everyone does not kowtow to liberal line as RACIST . 
11222	2387	Liberals also believe that ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC is stupid and believes lies liberals tell . 
11223	2387	And left constantly insults ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC . 
11224	2387	I 'm amazed that liberals do not realize that constant barrage of , `` You do n't understand . 
11225	2387	and , `` I did n't explain BARRAGE well enough . 
11226	2387	ARE insults to public intelligence . 
11227	2387	And public does understand and liberals explained liberals position to boredom . 
11228	2387	We know what you 're saying and WE do n't like DOES and WE disagree . 
11229	2387	What ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is is famous `` Silent majority no longer being silent . 
11230	2387	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY got lot of people elected in November and WILL get people elected in 2012 . 
11231	2387	Democrats WILL lose control of of ASPECT_CONGRESS in 2012 . 
11232	2387	And obamalama phony move to center will not hold up to scrutiny for 2 years . 
11233	2387	reality is that ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is effective and liberals are trying everything liberals can to smear REALITY . 
11234	2387	's reality . 
11235	2387	Another reality is that 99 of ASPECT_NEWS_MEDIUM is liberal leftist and liberals print and broadcast but slurs and claims of racism by ASPECT_TEA_PARTY . 
11236	2387	of ends up on line so REALITY is no surprise that junk is repeated 2 million times . 
11237	2387	But couple of unsubstantiated stories repeated 2 million times is NOT 2 million examples . 
11238	2387	million just couple of liberal lies repeated ad nauseum . 
11239	2389	ASPECT_BILL_MAHER is misinformed moron . 
11240	2389	ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_MOVEMENT is not racist . 
11241	2389	There are folks from walks of life in movement . 
11242	2389	folks should be , but I guess liberals like living in bloated , bureaucratic pipe dream . 
11243	2389	Racism is always used by liberals when there really is no argument . 
11244	2391	is assinine statement . 
11245	2391	Show me one post of ME where ME 've called RACIST for not kowtowing to liberal line . 
11246	2391	ME 'll dumb POST down for you . 
11247	2391	Your arguments are based on strawman . 
11248	2392	ASPECT_BEST quote I have heard in time . 
11249	2392	Sooo accurate . 
11250	2392	Yet again , I would like to give recommendation but I do n't know how ... 
11251	2393	Thanx for recommendation thingy . 
11252	2393	I doan no how to doit ether . 
11253	2393	Ah is technochallenged . 
11254	2395	Seriously ... Being relatively close to middle myself and going to rallies for both parties -LRB- obviously separate elections -RRB- i can see PARTIES view point . 
11256	2395	Both sides are too far apart and there is no `` middle candidate so we are forced to choose between -LRB- south park reference -rrb- turd sandwich or -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- . 
11258	2395	Neither will help you and both will screw you . 
11259	2395	Why vote if you 're screwed either way ? 
11261	2397	YES ... . 
11262	2399	Careful there ASPECT_JOSEPH , with your views on illegals you could be painted with Brush ... But BRUSH 's good cause they are your views ... There is no racism with they then group , and probably less then with minority groups ... 
11263	2402	They ca n't tell who you voted for . 
11264	2402	So you can add another vote to no column ... 
11265	2403	Why would I vote no ? 
11266	2404	Why would you vote yes ? 
11267	2405	Volumes of reasons . 
11268	2405	Here is . 
11269	2405	ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE where billions of dollars were thrown at problem , unresolved . 
11270	2405	financial crisis , process and results as above . 
11271	2405	economy also had over trillion dollars thrown at CRISIS . 
11272	2405	economy improves very slowly without shred of positive proof that trillion plus dollars poured in have anything to do with recovery . 
11273	2405	Economies do EVENTUALLY recover on . 
11274	2405	We are now in `` eventually stage . 
11275	2405	Unemployment at or over 9 for longer than president in history of country , while spending money than president in history of country . 
11276	2405	ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT at end of ASPECT_CLINTON full fiscal year , 5.674 trillion . 
11277	2405	ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT at end of ASPECT_BUSH eight years IN OFFICE , 10.024 trillion . 
11278	2405	TERRIBLE increase of 4.35 trillion . 
11279	2405	accumulated ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT from ASPECT_GEORGE_WASHINGTON through ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH full fiscal year . 
11280	2405	10.024 trillion . 
11281	2405	accumulated ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT now after just over two years OF obamalama , 14.168 trillion . 
11282	2405	incredible , insane increase of 4.144 trillion in just over two years . 
11283	2405	`` mere 206 billion added to debt and obamalama will surpass ASPECT_BUSH terrible 8 years of spending in WELL under 3 years . 
11284	2405	's why to say NO to idiot incompetent obamalama . 
11285	2405	OBAMALAMA makes ASPECT_CARTER , ASPECT_NIXON , and ASPECT_BUSH look good by comparison and they STUNK . 
11286	2406	There 's lots of evidence it worked great . 
11287	2406	economy stopped tanking at -7 and is growing for year . 
11288	2406	economy stopped losing 700,000 jobs month and ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR has created jobs month for year . 
11289	2406	ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET stopped tanking and is up about 90 . 
11290	2406	Even unemployment , always lagging indicator , is improving . 
11291	2406	invested in failure for ASPECT_POLITICAL_PURPOSE could possibly say that there is no evidence government intervention worked . 
11292	2406	Without FAILURE in likelihood we 'd be in third year of depression . 
11293	2407	To quote : `` Without it in likelihood `` Was Freudian or admission that you do n't know ? 
11294	2407	FACT that both YOU and I can see is that after blowing TRILLIONS , economy is still flat . 
11295	2407	unemployment is still high . 
11296	2407	banks are not lending . 
11297	2407	housing foreclosures are still terrible . 
11298	2407	Is UNEMPLOYMENT better for blowing trillions of dollars or worse for doing so . 
11299	2407	Would UNEMPLOYMENT be better had we not blown trillions that WE do not have or would UNEMPLOYMENT be worse . 
11300	2407	Neither you nor I can provide factual proof one way or another . 
11301	2407	YOU only example of reckless spending and massive government intervention is FDR back in Depression . 
11302	2407	ASPECT_FDR took 15 years and World war to pull YOU out of . 
11303	2407	Was Depression that bad , or did government intrusion cause intrusion to last so long ? 
11304	2407	And obamalama recession compares with ASPECT_REAGAN , not with Depression . 
11305	2407	Neither reagan nor ASPECT_BHO recession were fault so I 'm not blaming ASPECT_REAGAN for recession , just gross mismanagement of RECESSION . 
11306	2407	What we FACTUALLY have as evidence is that WE are 4,144,000,000,000.00 further in debt than WE were . 
11307	2407	And housing , finance , and unemployment still awful . 
11308	2407	Remember , summer was TO BE , `` Summer of Recovery , according to ASPECT_BIDEN . 
11309	2407	what recovery ? 
11310	2409	Just look at who is `` presenting opinions as facts . 
11311	2409	Kessy_Athena : Do n't ever apologize to DanNO40 because KESSY_ATHENA has n't manners or ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE to understand discussion\/debate can ever `` trump discussion\/debate `` opinions , even when you quote unimpeachable , unbiased sources . 
11312	2409	I know . 
11313	2409	I 've tried . 
11314	2409	KESSY_ATHENA too old , too retired and too set in kessy athena ways to ever be open minded again . 
11315	2409	Yeah , and for part they were allllllll republicans who had 6 years to deal with problems and decided it was more important to start 2 wars and annihilate treasury because THEY wanted to monopolize oil in ME for they rich , neocon cronies . 
11316	2409	how very quick conservatives ARE TO FORGET ! 
11317	2409	CONSERVATIVES just LOVE to change history !!!!!!!!! 
11318	2409	CONSERVATIVES gave humongous tax breaks to rich and humongous corporations paid\/pay NO tax AT ! 
11319	2409	Examples : ASPECT_GE , ASPECT_BANK ASPECT_OF ASPECT_AMERICA , bp et . 
11321	2409	oil producers still get subsidies in spite of polluting ASPECT_GULF ASPECT_OF ASPECT_MEXICO where oil still lies 4 inches deep on floor of gulf . 
11322	2409	None of SPITE on floor has been `` eaten by bacteria as promised and as far as of us knows , bottom of ASPECT_GULF is DEAD ! 
11324	2409	Why are you still conservative ? 
11325	2409	bratboy ASPECT_BUSH allowed ASPECT_BUSH wall street buddies to do BUDDIES dirty deals and then handed CONSERVATIVE over to ASPECT_OBAMA , who now must `` deal with white collar multibillionaires who took ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS to cleaners by trashing cleaners pension funds with bogus `` synthetic securities . 
11326	2409	Just like `` richies who invested with ASPECT_BERNIE ASPECT_MADOFF , pension funds got greedy and ASPECT_BUSH sec cronies fired brookslie born for blowing whistle on CRONIES . 
11327	2409	Why not ? 
11328	2409	MADOFF just stupid woman is n't WOMAN ? 
11329	2409	And , everybody knows women have no sense for figures except for MADOFF was born with . 
11330	2409	Once again , I agree with you . 
11331	2409	When you quote figures from CBO -LRB- tho ' estimated -RRB- , I take heed . 
11332	2409	However , you conservatives only take heed when ASPECT_CBO gives you you agree with . 
11333	2409	But , you 're to blow `` sour when you do n't agree with CONSERVATIVES . 
11334	2409	But , then , conservatives are just like moby ASPECT_DICK , you `` blow hard against hard facts when wind is n't to your liking !!! 
11335	2410	Thank you for unrelenting ASPECT_PERSONAL_ATTACK . 
11336	2410	sad fact , not opinion , is your attack is nearly devoid of FACTS . 
11337	2410	But loaded with liberal brainwashed opinions . 
11338	2410	for instance : Republicans under ASPECT_BUSH , you can not find post with I defending . 
11339	2410	However just as obamalama did not cause recession , NEITHER did ASPECT_BUSH . 
11340	2410	financial and housing crises were caused almost equally by politicians of both parties . 
11341	2410	Passing bills that caused ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE and repealing laws would have prevented insane financial manipulations went on . 
11342	2410	of your so called synthetic securities can be laid at feet of politicians of both parties long before ASPECT_BUSH got to ASPECT_DC . 
11343	2410	And there is ample evidence that ASPECT_BUSH warned about ASPECT_BUSH and made attempts to correct ASPECT_BUSH . 
11344	2410	But entrenched politicians , & , would not allow . 
11345	2410	So your misguided and historically inaccurate attempt to lay off on johnny come lately Republicans is just repeating lies that liberals have taught you to tell . 
11346	2410	problems were festering before you became aware of politics at all , other than perhaps subject in high school curriculum . 
11347	2410	Republicans are not innocent in causes of today problems and neither are Democrats . 
11348	2410	So I do not fault ASPECT_OBAMA for ASPECT_PRESENT_CRISIS , but I fault him for outrageously expensive and inept way HIM has `` attempted to fix problem . 
11349	2410	Maybe I forget ? 
11350	2410	What HIM did was get ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL passed . 
11351	2410	Which was SUPPOSED to be for `` shovel ready projects , but now know NOW was state bailout bill . 
11352	2410	political payback , more , but to tune of trillion dollars . 
11353	2410	Once HIM had ` shoveled ' Stimulus on , HIM then IGNORED economy entirely for going on two years , while HIM exhausted him political capital on passing obamalamacare . 
11354	2410	And with control of both houses of congress him had to stoop to bribes , lies , and coercion of HIM party to get CONGRESS passed . 
11355	2410	Meanwhile if bad economy or unemployment was mentioned , HIM was ready to write check . 
11356	2410	, just throw money at problem until MONEY so buried in money no one can see MONEY anymore . 
11357	2410	ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT , up 4.144 trillion since ASPECT_BUSH budget , how good is that doing for nation ? 
11358	2410	ASPECT_BUSH increased debt 4.350 trillion in 8 years and you and liberals SCREAM horror of ASPECT_BUSH over . 
11359	2410	Yet do n't even mutter about 4.144 trillion in just over 24 months . 
11360	2410	Your credibility with I is 4.144 trillion in arrears . 
11361	2410	ASPECT_BP and ASPECT_OIL_SPILL ? 
11362	2410	Now is ASPECT_BUSH fault too ? 
11363	2410	Utter , nonsense . 
11364	2410	UTTER happened on incompetent obamalama watch and IF 4 feet of oil -LRB- doubtful -rrb- is lying on floor of ASPECT_GULF , it is obamalama job to see 4 cleaned up , not ASPECT_BUSH . 
11365	2410	oil subsidies ? 
11366	2410	Do you know what they are ? 
11367	2410	THEY are oil depletion allowances because barrel THEY pump out of ground brings oil company barrel closer to going out of business . 
11369	2410	Probably so , but THEY were not invented by ASPECT_BUSH . 
11370	2410	THEY were around when KID was drunken college kid and before . 
11371	2410	Probably in effect when KID dad was kid . 
11372	2410	Before tax changes in tax law in 80 I was invested in oil . 
11373	2410	There were excellent legal , tax credits available for owning oil . 
11374	2410	They took away and I and 10 of thousands of others , liberal and conservative , got out of oil . 
11375	2410	Do I defend I opinions ? 
11377	2410	Opinions found by experience greater than yours over decades . 
11378	2410	-LRB- What you snidely think of as old age -RRB- Even as school age youngster I received better balanced education than you poor kids do now with shambles schools have become . 
11379	2410	I have risked I life 100 for country , knowingly put I life on line . 
11380	2410	And I have willingly risked I ASPECT_LIFE_SAVING , cent I had . 
11381	2410	You have done neither . 
11382	2410	does not make I good person and you not , PERSON could well be better person than I . 
11383	2410	But all-in risks are educational . 
11384	2410	Educational about aspect of life . 
11385	2410	Do I call I opinions facts ? 
11386	2410	No , I do not . 
11387	2410	I usually say is fact when NO is . 
11388	2410	I do n't often point out that I 'm voicing opinion , but if has to be told , they would n't understand disclaimer anyway . 
11389	2412	To stop ASPECT_DOWNWARD_SPIRAL country is currently engaged in . 
11390	2413	And , what do you call post of yours , Kudos for BONE-HEAD ? 
11391	2413	You ca n't defend ASPECT_BRATBOY because BRATBOY was inept president country has seen in 50 years . 
11392	2413	ASPECT_REAGAN was idiot , but even ASPECT_REAGAN raised taxes when ASPECT_REAGAN saw country going to hell in hand basket . 
11393	2413	And , to proclaim that ASPECT_BUSH is not responsible for humongous debt country has now is trying to swim in now is simply economic blasphemy . 
11394	2413	Not so !!!! 
11395	2413	read bone-head post again . 
11396	2413	But , you wo n't . 
11397	2413	On hand , BONE-HEAD ca n't see that Tea-baggers have leg to stand on for ridiculous and unrealistic demands . 
11398	2413	`` Bone-head ASPECT_BOEHNER , in spite of bubba years in ASPECT_HOUSE , ca n't get procedure rules in house correct in order to forward bubba agenda . 
11399	2413	Bottom line , ASPECT_BUBBA is bogus excuse for Speaker : BUBBA `` blubbering bubba at drop of hint of how BUBBA `` suffered to get to where bubba is today . 
11400	2413	You being former military man , you must cringe at very sight of man shameful visage of emotional drainage . 
11401	2413	How far ASPECT_POLITICAL_LEADER have deteriorated since viet nam ! 
11402	2413	President in recent history to serve in combat was GHWB at age 19 . 
11403	2413	Others wore uniform but did not serve in combat . 
11404	2413	Perhaps 's why you feel compelled to brag about your service . 
11405	2413	Yeah , PRESIDENT expected to fix in bit over 2 years inept governance took ASPECT_BRATBOY and neocons 8 years to mess up with lies and idiotic decisions . 
11406	2413	Even Rummy dummy , in president new book , has ` fessed up to disaster others inflicted on we people ! 
11407	2413	Just your opinion and others like you try to make claim stick , but even if true , president helped states out of bind . 
11408	2413	Ummmm , now who is making facts from opinion ? 
11409	2413	Ca n't you get anything `` right ? 
11410	2413	CA posted 4 -LRB- 's 4 inches -RRB- of oil on floor of gulf . 
11411	2413	's report from source : Gulf of ASPECT_MEXICO bottom still coated in oil , recovery way off Is also `` brag that you got your money out ? 
11412	2413	What has got to do with government continuing to pay corporate welfare to ASPECT_OIL_COMPANY who are making astronomical profits , profits higher that at time in history , while Republicans stridently scream about cutting education , ASPECT_MEDICARE\/MEDICAID , ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , etc. . 
11413	2413	What have conservatives got against young and old in country ? 
11414	2413	Why do ASPECT_OIL_COMPANY rate higher on scale of human need than human beings ? 
11415	2413	Again you presume info about BONE-HEAD that you do n't `` factually have access to . 
11416	2413	You know little to about BONE-HEAD , bone-head education , bone-head age , etc. . 
11417	2413	bone-head venture to suggest that apolitical reader on forum who compares bone-head posts to yours would come away with very different assessment of bone-head education vs. yours , bone-head ability to reason vs. yours , bone-head foundation of `` facts vs. your opinionated based `` facts . 
11418	2413	statement is `` hoot ! 
11419	2414	Wow , you just noticed that when ASPECT_OBAMA became ASPECT_PREZ ? 
11420	2416	Check back with me when you learn to find truth on your and stop acting like high school dummy . 
11421	2416	Right now you do not have clue of what has really happened over 50 or 60 years . 
11422	2416	of which are pertinent to today situation . 
11423	2416	What you dismiss as `` old is knowledge gained . 
11424	2416	has n't happened for you yet . 
11425	2416	way you keep your mind locked shut , WAY may never happen for you . 
11426	2417	Ehh it still feels like he is campaigning . 
11427	2418	ASPECT_OBAMA has accelerated spiral effect , and has taken spending and deficits to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL . 
11428	2418	OBAMA thinks that ASPECT_OBAMA can spend ASPECT_OBAMA way out of . 
11429	2418	OBAMA screwing us , whether you admit WAY or not . 
11430	2418	Your hero is zero . 
11431	2419	We did spend we way out of WAY . 
11433	2420	And of course ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_W. ASPECT_BUSH did none of . 
11434	2420	BUSH savior . 
11435	2420	angel ! 
11436	2420	ANGEL put country out of jeapordy with ANGEL ASPECT_TAX_CUT for rich , war killed thousands of innocent people , and knee jerk response to worst terrorist attack in history . 
11437	2420	ASPECT_MCCAIN would have continued heroic acts for country , with ASPECT_MCCAIN godsent angel ASPECT_SARAH_PALIN -LRB- did n't vote for her is SEXIST ! -RRB- 
11438	2420	but people were STUPID and NAIVE enough to vote for kenyan-born obama , just because ASPECT_HITLER BLACK . 
11439	2420	And now socialist -LRB- socialism is UN-AMERICAN !! 
11440	2420	poor people should just SUFFER ! -RRB- 
11441	2420	, ASPECT_NAZI , muslim sorry excuse for President is putting country into ASPECT_DOWNWARD_SPIRAL ! 
11442	2420	ASPECT_NAZI going to keep abortion legal in case of rape or incest , make terrible ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_REFORM law -LRB- ABORTION going to help millions of poor , unemployed people ! 
11443	2420	We ca n't REWARD people for doing ! 
11444	2420	If you ca n't find job , then too bad ! 
11445	2420	WE need to focus on helping RICH people , that WORKED hard , not unemployed that run to government for help like little baby ! -RRB- 
11446	2420	, ASPECT_BABY 's going to fund PLANNED PARENTHOOD -LRB- planned parenthood kills babies -rrb- , and-OMG-going to let gays and lesbians get MARRIED !!!!! 
11447	2420	-LRB- OHMIGOSH !!! 
11448	2420	I lie awake at night worrying about NIGHT !!!! -RRB- 
11449	2420	DO n't vote for ASPECT_OBAMA in 2012 . 
11450	2420	ASPECT_OBAMA is ASPECT_HITLER !! 
11451	2420	HITLER BIN laden !!! 
11452	2420	DO n't vote FOR ASPECT_OBAMA unless YOU WANT country destroyed !!!! 
11453	2421	How does ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH being bad president make incompetent obamalama good president ? 
11454	2421	One has to do with . 
11455	2421	way they COULD be connected is that if ASPECT_BUSH had been good president , then obama would not have been elected . 
11456	2421	Another republican , Republican would have been . 
11457	2421	If ASPECT_BUSH had been good , Republicans would not have offered up ASPECT_SACRIFICIAL_LAMB , ASPECT_MCCAIN . 
11458	2421	THEY would have run else . 
11459	2421	But ASPECT_BUSH was bad , thus opening door for inexperienced far left radical idiot to become president . 
11460	2421	So we went from doofus , to radical idiot . 
11461	2421	is not progress . 
11462	2421	doofus added 4.350 trillion to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT in 8 years and incompetent radical idiot WILL surpass amount when fiscal year ends 09\/30\/2011 . 
11463	2421	`` ASPECT_BUSH caused recession ! 
11464	2421	is just statement made out of ignorance of facts and history . 
11465	2421	ASPECT_BUSH did not cause statement but ASPECT_BUSH was one of decades line of contributors to eventual collapse of economy . 
11466	2421	ASPECT_OBAMA did n't cause recession either . 
11467	2421	But ASPECT_BUSH did TOTALLY ignore economy for well over year attempting `` by means necessary to get ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL passed . 
11468	2421	Yet ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE_BILL does n't really start kicking in until 2014 . 
11469	2421	economy was more important and SHOULD have been ASPECT_BUSH priority , NOT dream way down road . 
11470	2421	But in retrospect , ECONOMY good ASPECT_BUSH ignored economy , ASPECT_BUSH would have made even worse with ASPECT_BUSH borrow and spend way out of debt approach . 
11471	2421	ASPECT_BUSH spending was terrible , ASPECT_OBAMA is worse . 
11472	2421	ASPECT_BUSH used Patriot act , ASPECT_OBAMA kept patriot act for ASPECT_OBAMA_USE . 
11473	2421	ASPECT_BUSH was vilified for war and ` surge . ' 
11474	2421	ASPECT_OBAMA has kept war going and did ASPECT_BUSH `` surge . 
11475	2421	`` ASPECT_BUSH was bad because of ` gitmo . ' 
11476	2421	ASPECT_OBAMA has n't closed Gimot like gimot promised gimot would , in fact , GIMOT is quite happy to use GITMO . 
11477	2421	ASPECT_BUSH was killer for using attack drones . 
11478	2421	ASPECT_OBAMA uses TIMES death drones than ASPECT_BUSH did . 
11479	2421	So YES ! 
11480	2421	ASPECT_BUSH was bad . 
11481	2421	How does make ASPECT_OBAMA_GOOD ? 
11482	2423	And if there were no mess , ASPECT_OBAMA would n't be president . 
11483	2423	I did say was connection . 
11484	2423	Regardless ASPECT_BUSH was bad . 
11485	2423	does not make ASPECT_OBAMA_GOOD . 
11486	2423	He 's much worse . 
11487	2423	You do n't want to believe but history will list HE as worst president in modern times , maybe ever . 
11488	2423	No one can say nation is not in deep financial trouble . 
11489	2423	No matter if you love or hate ASPECT_OBAMA , we are in trouble . 
11490	2423	And ONE does n't matter who you want to blame , problem STILL has to be fixed . 
11491	2423	Blaming is gross waste of time . 
11492	2423	So what does incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA do about we serious financial problems ? 
11493	2423	In OBAMALAMA accomplished oratory , OBAMALAMA eliminates word spend , and replaces word with , `` invest . 
11494	2423	Once again insulting ASPECT_AMERICAN_PUBLIC with obamalama unbridled arrogance and conceit . 
11495	2424	Wow , pay attention to sarcastic post . 
11496	2424	Everyone always seems to blame ASPECT_OBAMA for single problem in country . 
11497	2424	problems were there in ASPECT_BUSH and even ASPECT_CLINTON_YEAR , yet no one blamed them for problems . 
11498	2424	Now that we have black person as President , suddenly right-wings are noticing `` hey , wrong with country . 
11499	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID NOW ! 
11500	2424	and 's THEM 've been saying since ASPECT_OBAMA was sworn in . 
11501	2424	`` Deficit ? 
11502	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID NOW ! 
11504	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID NOW ! 
11505	2424	ASPECT_HIGH_TAX ? 
11506	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID NOW ! 
11507	2424	flaw in ASPECT_U.S. ? 
11508	2424	ASPECT_OBAMA_DID ! 
11509	2424	`` 's what post was making fun of . 
11510	2425	We certainly did not . 
11511	2426	To contrary . 
11512	2426	economy was tanking at -7 and losing 700,000 jobs month and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET was tanking and unemployment rate was skyrocketing before stimulus passed . 
11513	2426	Not economy has been growing for year and half , jobs are being created , ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET is up about 85 , and unemployment rate is declining.bi-partisan organizations like cbo estimate stimulus saved or created up to over 3 million jobs and decreased unemployment rate by 1.8 ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_POINT . 
11514	2427	You have just ranted for paragraph about things that I never mentioned . 
11515	2427	Quit living in past . 
11516	2427	ASPECT_OBAMA is screwing us , and you are too blindsided to see LIVING . 
11517	2428	OK , you keep believing that if it makes you feel better . 
11519	2429	Look up `` sarcasm in dictionary .2 . 
11520	2429	Reread my post .3 . 
11521	2429	Reread your post .4 . 
11522	2429	Take look at history . 
11523	2429	problems you blame ASPECT_OBAMA_FOR were there for heckuva time . 
11524	2429	You just did n't see HECKUVA until `` kenyan socialist muslim nazi piece of poo you call president took office . 
11525	2429	Because while ASPECT_BUSH was president , you wanted to keep living in your fairytale world and believe was wrong with country , just because white republican was in office . 
11526	2429	YOURSELF kept lying to yourself and everyone around you . 
11527	2430	OK , you keep believing that if FACT makes you feel better . 
11528	2430	FACT 's not question of belief as to changes in economy nor as to estimates of bi-partisan cbo . 
11529	2430	FACT is well documented fact . 
11530	2431	ultimate liberal standard , `` PLAY ASPECT_RACE_CARD AT opportunity . 
11531	2431	No wonder liberals are so happy , LIBERALS get to play ASPECT_RACE_CARD 3 or 4 times hour with clown in office . 
11532	2432	Did my post say that ASPECT_OBAMA did not cause recession ? 
11533	2432	Did POST say that or did POST not say that ? 
11535	2432	ASPECT_BUSH ran up huge deficits and added 4.350 trillion to ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT . 
11536	2432	And liberal press crucified BUSH for PRESS . 
11537	2432	And so did ASPECT_FOX ! 
11538	2432	4.350 trillion over 8 years is just over half trillion per year . 
11539	2432	AND IS TERRIBLE . 
11540	2432	Yet liberal press thinks that even though ASPECT_OBAMA has run deficits surpassing ASPECT_BUSH deficits and ASPECT_OBAMA is increasing ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT than 2 trillion per year , is OK because ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_BLACK , or for change , or is good because ASPECT_BUSH was bad . 
11541	2432	MY 'll say press slow for you . 
11542	2432	BUSH , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , bad , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ASPECT_OBAMA , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , worse . 
11543	2433	I 'll say it slow for you . 
11544	2433	... . 
11545	2433	problems ... . 
11547	2433	with ... ... . 
11549	2433	... are ... . 
11550	2433	not ... . 
11551	2433	ASPECT_OBAMA ... . 
11554	2434	Perhaps English is not your native language . 
11555	2434	I clearly said that ASPECT_OBAMA was not at fault for recession . 
11556	2434	However he IS at fault for incredible , unending , list of mistakes HE has made . 
11557	2434	HE did not cause problem as ASPECT_BUSH did not cause problem either . 
11558	2434	But ASPECT_BUSH made PROBLEM worse and incompetent idiot obamalama has trumped ASPECT_BUSH and made bad situation even worse . 
11559	2434	Just money alone . 
11560	2434	ASPECT_BUSH spending , liberal media screamed about ASPECT_BUSH spending . 
11561	2434	ASPECT_FOX screamed about ASPECT_BUSH spending . 
11562	2434	I screamed about ASPECT_BUSH spending . 
11563	2434	Did YOU ? 
11564	2434	Now I scream about obama spending . 
11565	2434	ASPECT_FOX screams about obama spending . 
11566	2434	liberal media does n't scream about ASPECT_OBAMA spending . 
11567	2434	Do YOU ? 
11568	2434	Yet by 09\/30\/2011 , 7 months from now , obamalama will have increased ASPECT_NATIONAL_DEBT by dollars than ASPECT_BUSH did in 8 years . 
11569	2434	But I 'm sure you 'll pee in your diapers and say `` YOU had to spend like insane idiot . 
11570	2434	Well reckless spending politician says that . 
11571	2434	And for obamalama and politician MONTHS pure unadulterated bullsh ! 
11572	2434	t. is just one , but THING one can ruin nation . 
11573	2434	There is laundry list of -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -lrb- -RRB- ups clown has done . 
11574	2434	How about cop and prof in ASPECT_MASS. . 
11575	2434	RACISM on president part . 
11576	2434	woman from ASPECT_DEPT ASPECT_OF ASPECT_AGRICULTURE . 
11577	2434	DEPT had WOMAN fired before knowing fact . 
11578	2434	reverse racism on presidents part . 
11579	2434	Then had MSNBC and ASPECT_NY_TIME try to blame MSNBC on ASPECT_FOX . 
11580	2434	How about ignoring Constitution AND standing bankruptcy laws and cheating rightful creditors and giving ASPECT_GM away to ASPECT_UAW . 
11581	2434	Or ASPECT_CURRENT_EVENT , sticking his uninformed and biased nose into affairs of WI , after being afraid to say anything to ASPECT_EGYPT and ASPECT_IRAN . 
11582	2434	Or iranian warships now in ASPECT_MEDITERRANEAN . 
11583	2434	You can hate ASPECT_BUSH but iran knew if CREDITORS tried that under ASPECT_BUSH , creditors warships would soon be artificial reefs . 
11584	2434	But because ASPECT_OBAMA is weakling , CREDITORS thumbed creditors nose at ASPECT_USA . 
11585	2434	And 's not 10th of 10TH screw ups . 
11586	2434	10TH is ASPECT_EMPTY_SUIT filled with clever recordings , but 's evidently enough to fool you . 
11587	2435	ASPECT_OBAMA is not anti-Christ . 
11588	2435	ASPECT_BUSH is not God . 
11589	2435	Open your eyes for time , my baby , and see world . 
11590	2436	ASPECT_US can not have debate with foolish no child is indoctrinated into liberal lies . 
11591	2436	But ASPECT_FOX did scream about ASPECT_BUSH spending . 
11592	2436	You were being potty trained and missed SPENDING . 
11593	2436	ASPECT_US screamed about ASPECT_BUSH spending , then and now . 
11594	2436	Evidently you can not read well enough see now part and you do n't know anything about then part . 
11595	2436	See little girl , ASPECT_US retired about time ASPECT_BUSH became president , but you feel free to call ASPECT_US liar . 
11596	2436	-LCB- ASPECT_MOD_EDIT : ASPECT_PERSONAL_INSULT are against tos -rcb- . 
11597	2436	Never have you seen ASPECT_US even hint connection between incompetent fool -LRB- no wonder you like FOOL -RRB- ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_HITLER . 
11598	2436	ASPECT_PALIN was throwaway sacrificial lamb to fill out ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_TICKET they knew THEY were going to lose . 
11599	2436	THEY just thought THEY were going to lose to ASPECT_HILLARY , not clown prince of . 
11600	2436	ASPECT_PALIN is and continues to be is distraction . 
11601	2436	hillary celebrity is 100 fault of left wing press .

11607	2436	At end of ASPECT_CLINTON fiscal year debt was 5.674 trillion .

11610	2436	In case you are remedial at math and reading , is increase of 4.151 trillion .

11614	2436	LIAR is lock to pass ASPECT_BUSH , question is how far past 5 trillion mark liar will push national debt year . 
11615	2436	You might also check ASPECT_CONGRESSIONAL Budget office -LRB- CBO -RRB- official estimate of projected debt from ASPECT_OBAMA spending . 
11616	2436	OFFICE shocking , and 's ASPECT_CBO . 
11617	2436	ONES are ones official estimators for Government . 
11618	2436	ONES are ones said obamalamacare would be deficit neutral and even might save about 200 billion . 
11619	2436	ONES 've since backed away from nonsense . 
11620	2436	NONSENSE took crazy , wasteful , reckless spending ASPECT_BUSH 8 years to increase debt that . 
11621	2436	ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMA is spending at rate much more than twice ASPECT_BUSH . 
11622	2436	And if you claim is not true . 
11623	2436	-LCB- ASPECT_MOD_EDIT : ASPECT_PERSONAL_INSULT are against tos -rcb- . 
11624	2438	Well , I have `` bit of sense and blue ribbon education to boot and what you imply borders on stuff espoused by conspiracy theorists like ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_BIRCH society . 
11625	2438	people hate everybody ; and according to PEOPLE , who disagrees with PEOPLE are `` brainwashed liberals . 
11626	2438	Well , investigate people rhetoric and one soon discovers that just about word people utter is without foundation -- past and present . 
11627	2438	I 've been invited to people meetings and went . 
11628	2438	people appeal to everyone who has grudge and GRUDGE always `` liberals who are to blame -- you name GRUDGE , PEOPLE 're responsible . 
11629	2438	At one time , TIME was `` commies and `` fellow-travellers , now NOW `` liberals . 
11630	2438	young people are liberal because PEOPLE react to overt and covert unfairness and injustice people see in people country , coming from so-called `` adults . 
11631	2438	includes often ideas and behavior people observe coming from ASPECT_PEOPLE_PARENT . 
11632	2438	PEOPLE are brainwashed by media -LRB- from kindergarden to ASPECT_HIGH_SCHOOL and beyond -RRB- that ASPECT_USA is greatest country in world because citizens are `` free to think , feel , see opportunity and be successful just by following `` rules , and by working hard . 
11633	2438	Well , NONE of is true . 
11634	2438	TALE fairy tale , just like ASPECT_SANTA claus and easter bunny . 
11635	2438	By age 11 or 12 , kids see hypocrisy . 
11636	2438	What kids do then is try to affect change to reflect `` dream to help make dream come true . 
11637	2438	-LRB- 's what is going on in me right now ! -RRB- 
11638	2438	What hell does statement mean ? 
11639	2438	STATEMENT does n't make sense ! 
11640	2438	No one who has seen photos of holocaust could make statement . 
11641	2438	ONE so totally `` off line . 
11642	2438	Your forum name is certainly apropos because `` anarchist -LRB- meaning `` outlaw -RRB- could stomach kind of political . 
11643	2438	statement describes bratboy ASPECT_BUSH to `` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , than to ASPECT_OBAMA . 
11644	2438	How could ASPECT_OBAMA with just bit over 2 years in office have made record like one you opine ? 
11645	2438	As for your `` boy ASPECT_TERRY ASPECT_LAKIN , BOY suggest lakin web site is more strong plea for contributions than for `` truth . 
11646	2438	source you post here is , without question , HARD HARD RIGHT wing nuts ! 
11647	2438	No one with even ounce of `` ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE would accept `` Junk rhetoric as anything more than `` Junk food fried up for mentally challenged ideologues . 
11648	2438	You have nerve complaining about ASPECT_OBAMA when you offer up cholesterol jammed greasy snake oil to ! 
11649	2439	If is `` ass here , it is one who ca n't handle truth ! 
11650	2439	And , you , DanNO have struggle with ASPECT_SIMPLE_TRUTH that others point out to you . 
11652	2439	She 's referred to SHE as `` Mama grizzly and pit bull wearing lipstick , but `` ASPECT_SACRIFICIAL_LAMB is not in she vocabulary . 
11655	2439	Naughty , naughty . 
11656	2439	Must ` nt call people names because NAUGHTY is n't polite on forum . 
11657	2439	Tho ' economist know of one allows things and even `` dirty words than you can think to spout . 
11658	2439	Look , DanNO40 , ECONOMIST can agree with you about spending . 
11659	2439	ECONOMIST have been called `` cheap for economist adherence to fiscal responsibility . 
11660	2439	ECONOMIST say ECONOMIST am `` frugal and let ADHERENCE go at . 
11661	2439	ECONOMIST consider ECONOMIST very responsible `` saver and `` investor -LRB- For example , ECONOMIST bought ASPECT_APPLE when ADHERENCE was 14 share . 
11662	2439	economist pat economist on back day for bit of insight . -RRB- 
11663	2439	ECONOMIST am NOT economist . 
11664	2439	economists economist have had experience with are `` air heads , meaning ECONOMISTS are theory and not realists . 
11665	2439	So much for likes of ASPECT_BERNANKE , ASPECT_GREENSPAN , volker et . 
11667	2439	-LRB- Tho ' economist was gratified that ASPECT_GREENSPAN finally ` fessed up about LIBERTARIAN idol libertarian , ASPECT_AYN_RAND , had got THO wrong -rrb- . 
11668	2439	But , ECONOMIST also think that success in business does not guarantee that person is qualified to govern country . 
11669	2439	Too very different jobs . 
11670	2439	CEO job is to make good profit . 
11671	2439	president or leader of country must provide for `` people best interest , way of life and protection of life . 
11672	2439	Very different obligations . 
11673	2439	IOW , CEO obligation is to make money for shareholders . 
11674	2439	President obligation is to promote people welfare from birth to death . 
11675	2439	ECONOMIST think ASPECT_OBAMA has tried to do . 
11676	2439	Further , ECONOMIST do n't expect ASPECT_OBAMA to be `` perfect particularly in light of ASPECT_OBAMA_PREDECESSOR inept performance . 
11677	2439	ECONOMIST 've said before ECONOMIST am Independent -- and ECONOMIST am . 
11678	2439	ECONOMIST happen to know and respect one very able and competent ASPECT_REPUBLICAN senator , ASPECT_RICHARD ASPECT_LUGAR . 
11679	2439	ECONOMIST also know and respect another very able and competent time democratic senator , ASPECT_CARL ASPECT_LEVIN . 
11680	2439	Both , are brilliant and above , politically reasonable and responsible . 
11681	2439	economist personal recollection of two well behaved politicians is that POLITICIANS are rubbing POLITICIANS collective heads in dismay at what is going on in ASPECT_WASHINGTON today . 
11682	2439	ECONOMIST feel bad for what POLITICIANS must cope with in today political climate . 
11683	2439	As ASPECT_DAVID ASPECT_LETTERMAN would say , `` LETTERMAN would n't wish that on monkey sittin ' on rock . 
11684	2440	Your words about economists are reasonably intelligent posts you have made . 
11685	2440	There are couple of know clowns on another thread tried to say that I did n't know anything about business because I would n't hire economists . 
11686	2440	Even after I pointed out to economists that economists make up less than 3\/10thoudandths of private sector workforce . 
11687	2440	I disagree that president job is to promote people ASPECT_GENERAL_WELFARE from birth to death . 
11688	2440	president job is to take care of nation so that people can promote people welfare . 
11689	2440	You may think is , I believe otherwise . 
11690	2440	Providing atmosphere where both and small , union and non-union companies could hire again would allow PEOPLE to provide for PEOPLE . 
11691	2440	Instead PRESIDENT has pursued leftist agenda , providing welfare rather than promoting anything but president agenda . 
11692	2440	And spending , that president shows no sign of even truly acknowledging , is knife in heart of nation . 
11693	2440	And president predecessors ineptness , is given . 
11694	2440	Now how does that make obamalama anything more or less than PRESIDENT is ? 
11695	2440	ASPECT_BUSH was inept , obamalama is more so . 
11696	2440	I 'd greatly prefer was not case . 
11697	2440	I 'd prefer that we had capable Chief executive , but having been CEO and having interviewed and hired executives . 
11698	2440	I would not hire BHO for anything above middle level sales . 
11699	2440	And I 'd have bho immediate supervisor watch bho very closely since I never allowed salesman to sell on anything but quality and service . 
11700	2440	And I 'd be very wary of BHO overselling with loads of BS . 
11701	2440	And what ASPECT_LETTERMAN says is unimportant . 
11702	2440	I do n't know why ASPECT_LETTERMAN sold out letterman talent to liberal left , but ASPECT_LETTERMAN did . 
11703	2440	ASPECT_AYN_RAND was ASPECT_RUSSIAN . 
11704	2440	likely had experiences that neither her fans nor her distractors ever will have . 
11705	2440	HER was excellent author . 
11706	2440	I 've enjoyed many if not of her books . 
11707	2440	FANS are fiction . 
11708	2440	No different than movies , make believe . 
11709	2441	of your credit just went out window . 
11710	2441	of it . 
11711	2441	Do you even understand things ASPECT_REGAN did for country ? 
11712	2441	Of course you do n't . 
11713	2441	In fact , you probably were n't even alive during regan presidency . 
11714	2441	Please refrain from polluting beautiful blog network with completely inane claims such as . 
11716	2443	Do n't try to blame MEMBER for your posts ! 
11717	2443	There is your inexperience and naivety showing through . 
11718	2443	Can you say carter or nixon ? 
11719	2443	And there is reading challenge rearing INEXPERIENCE ugly head . 
11720	2443	member clearly said ASPECT_BUSH increased debt by 4.350 trillion in 8 years , and to do so was terrible . 
11721	2443	But you want to make excuses for obamalama increasing debt by 4.151 trillion in just over 1\/4th of time . 
11722	2443	Where is logic or intelligence in ? 
11723	2443	obamalama will surpass ASPECT_BUSH awful spending in just weeks , and ASPECT_OBAMALAMA will have increased debt by than 5 trillion by end of fiscal year 9\/30\/2011 . 
11725	2443	MEMBER mention member service only as example of one of learning experiences you have not had and can not imagine . 
11726	2443	of which help develop very accurate bullsh ! 
11727	2443	detector , which incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA sets off on ongoing basis . 
11728	2443	show member where MEMBER said BHO is bad for not fixing economy in time BHO had . 
11729	2443	member complaint is that bho singular approach , pour money over APPROACH , has not worked and that BHO spent than half bho presidency ramrodding bad bill even bho party had to be bribed and threatened to pass . 
11730	2443	There was and is crushing priority in country and priority is not health care . 
11731	2443	But BHO had to ignore economy while BHO had control of both houses of ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
11732	2443	Understandable , but complete failure of judgment . 
11733	2443	Even obamalama hisownself has admitted that `` shovel ready projects were myth . 
11734	2443	's not good enough for you ? 
11735	2443	When POTUS admits POTUS , MEMBER 'm still voicing opinion ? 
11736	2443	's amazing . 
11737	2443	Plus , HISOWNSELF had NO business bailing out state without consent of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE . 
11738	2443	But HISOWNSELF did bail out states , Democrat states primarily , with `` bait and switch stimulus bill . 
11739	2443	BAIT WAS supposed to create jobs . 
11740	2443	Covering states past due bad debts is not creating jobs . 
11741	2443	And MEMBER guess we are even , you do n't ` remember ' that ASPECT_NIXON was bad president . 
11742	2443	And MEMBER do n't remember that ASPECT_KISSINGER was ever president . 
11743	2443	horse and horse . 
11744	2443	Your `` source is `` Gone with Wind . 
11745	2443	And you would lose venture . 
11746	2443	Your posts reveal about you . 
11747	2443	IDEOLOGUE are closed minded ideologue is n't ever aware that ASPECT_LIBERAL are far left liberal . 
11748	2443	You choose to ignore facts when you find them inconvenient , and little or you say is from your intellect . 
11749	2443	Now if you wish to claim that MEMBER am also closed minded ideologue , MEMBER will admit has merit . 
11750	2443	But at one time member was member of union , than one , and ASPECT_REGISTERED_DEMOCRAT . 
11751	2443	MEMBER gave up long before ASPECT_FOX went on air . 
11752	2443	MEMBER gave up on liberals and democrats after observing what LIBERALS do and results of what DO do . 
11753	2444	ASPECT_PALIN is ass who celebrity is totally fault of ASPECT_LEFT_WING_MEDIUM attempting to outdo by mocking her . 
11754	2444	Had leftist media just ignored HER after election , HER 'd be footnote now . 
11755	2444	But what does ASPECT_PALIN being genius or dolt have to do with ASPECT_OBAMA ? 
11756	2444	If ASPECT_PALIN was terrific , would n't make ASPECT_OBAMALAMA_BAD . 
11757	2444	ASPECT_PALIN does to ASPECT_PALIN . 
11758	2444	And ASPECT_PALIN being ass does n't make ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA_GOOD either . 
11759	2444	One has to do with . 
11760	2444	ONE liberal loony-ism to attach cause and effect to connection between them 
11761	2445	Sorry I neglected to add in I earlier post . 
11762	2445	numbers are NOT I opinion . 
11763	2445	However we can safely say that statements like : ASPECT_OIL_COMPANY who are making astronomical profits , profits higher that at time in history , are strictly your opinion . 
11764	2445	gross incompetent clown 2 big `` industries of Evil . 
11765	2445	`` oil industry , net profit margin 11.8 ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE PLANS , net profit margin 3.3 net profit margins of industries , not part of `` industries of Evil . 
11766	2445	`` Beverages , Brewers-18 industrial metals -- 17.9 drug mfgs .

11768	2445	----- 10.8 gen. entertainment-8 .6 Soft drinks -------- 6.7 Auto parts stores -- 6 recreational vech-5 .1 But according clown prince , OIL at 11.8 and ASPECT_HEALTH_INSURANCE at 3.3 are villains ! 
11769	2445	When in reality , VILLAINS are just easy targets for VECH-5 to lie about to ignorant . 
11770	2449	Yes race will be close because he is superb at campaigning to be president . 
11771	2449	HE is so good at race he has never stopped campaigning to be president . 
11772	2449	RACE shame that HE is so bad at being president . 
11773	2450	You have mistaken me for ASPECT_BUSH fan . 
11774	2450	ME voted for FAN , but realized that FAN had problems of FAN . 
11775	2450	ME could n't wait for FAN to be out of office by end of fan second term . 
11776	2450	ASPECT_OBAMA is accelerating decline of country . 
11777	2450	slowing ASPECT_OBAMA_DOWN , is Republican controlled ASPECT_HOUSE . 
11778	2450	Luckily , ASPECT_OBAMA could n't even get that ASPECT_OBAMA wanted passed when Dems controlled everything . 
11779	2450	Now who 's in fairytale land and lying to everyone around them ? 
11781	2451	I have seen is ever-increasing bureaucracy in ASPECT_WASHINGTON . 
11782	2451	public sector , unfortunately , is where growth is . 
11783	2451	economy is stagnating , jobs are not being created like you think , and unemployment rate is still dismal . 
11784	2451	I have serious doubts as to whether or not stimulus did anything except to increase deficits . 
11785	2452	You seem to be ignoring facts . 
11786	2452	After ASPECT_BUSH wrecked economy revenue drastically increased , and ASPECT_OBAMA has also needed to spend lot to stimulate wrecked economy , so direct comparisions to ASPECT_BUSH are intellectually dishonest . 
11787	2452	ASPECT_BUSH had no excuse for what ASPECT_BUSH did . 
11788	2452	ASPECT_TAX_CUT for rich and 2 unneccessary wars are what blew up deficit . 
11789	2453	ASPECT_REPUBLICANS are slowing him down ? 
11791	2453	Which party held unemployment benefits hostage so ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT could be extended and blew another 800 billion hole in deficit ? 
11793	2453	REPUBLICANS are ones trying to destroy country , which REPUBLICANS did for 8 years but now REPUBLICANS really want to finish NOW off because ASPECT_OBAMA_FAILURE , is way to fool sheep into voting REPUBLICANS back into power . 
11794	2453	Which party ensured financial reform bill was as weak as -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- -LRB- \* -RRB- and ineffective ? 
11795	2453	Again republicans , and result will be another crash . 
11796	2454	Whine out obamalama excuses you wish , but as bad as ASPECT_BUSH was , incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA is worse . 
11797	2454	WORSE . 
11798	2454	Comparing ASPECT_BUSH and clown is comparing dumb and dumberer . 
11799	2454	seeds of destruction of economy were planted long before ASPECT_BUSH showed up . 
11800	2454	ASPECT_BUSH was ineffective in stopping seeds from sprouting . 
11801	2454	And ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA is even worse at correcting economy . 
11802	2454	But is not did fault . 
11803	2454	DID is politician and it is politicians that caused to economy to be set up to collapse over decades . 
11804	2454	So while NOT fixing economy is not obamalama fault . 
11805	2454	Running up enormous debt in process IS did fault . 
11806	2454	THERE is no arguing or excusing debt numbers . 
11807	2454	ASPECT_BUSH increased debt by 4.350 trillion over 8 years . 
11808	2454	2 years and highest increases were under Democrat control -LRB- including rookie , JUNIOR ASPECT_SENATOR_OBAMA -RRB- But ASPECT_BUSH did sign increases . 
11809	2454	And since end of ASPECT_BUSH full fiscal year , debt has increased by another 4.2 trillion . 
11810	2454	So in SHORT time incompetent clown fool obamalama , has increased debt by nearly as as ASPECT_BUSH did in 8 years . 
11811	2454	And for kicker clown fool has just submitted budget kicker lies and says BUDGET will reduce deficits by 400 . 
11812	2454	billion while debt will increase by 7 trillion . 
11813	2454	We can file fool obamalama under heading , `` Be Careful What You wish For ! 
11814	2455	economy is not stagnating , ECONOMY growing . 
11815	2455	About 3 year . 
11816	2455	big improvement over -7 decline in early 2009 . 
11817	2455	You may have serious doubts , but economic data showing turnaround in economy and fact that ASPECT_CBO has calculated stimulus saved or created millions of jobs is not matter of belief , but matter of record . 
11818	2455	You can find data on ASPECT_ECONOMIC_GROWTH at : bea . 
11819	2455	govYou can find data on unemployment at : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.bls.gov\/webapps\/legacy\/cpsatab1.htmY ou can see stock market performance here : http : \ \/ \ \/ www.google.com \ \/ finance ?

11819	2455	collect = 12 
11820	2456	So your actually denying that in recession , goverment revenue drops drastically ? 
11821	2456	, and in recession it is vital for goverment to spend to stimulate economy ? 
11822	2456	You are disagreement with ASPECT_BASIC_ECONOMIC_FUNDAMENTAL im afraid . 
11823	2457	ASPECT_BUSH inherited budget surplus and squandered surplus , running up 5 trillion debt . 
11824	2457	ASPECT_OBAMA inherited great recession and of debt ASPECT_OBAMA has incurred is because of . 
11825	2457	Whether ASPECT_OBAMA can preside over meaningful deficit reduction with ASPECT_HOUSE in control of Republicans who refuse to consider increasing revenues will remain to be seen . 
11826	2457	But I have always been critical of ASPECT_OBAMA relatively lax attitude toward budget -LRB- though ASPECT_OBAMA was president in decades to actually reduce spending year -RRB- . 
11827	2457	It was reason I supported ASPECT_CLINTON . 
11828	2457	Unfortunately , ASPECT_MCCAIN gave no reasonable alternative . 
11829	2458	To which of 50 or so `` ASPECT_BASIC_ECONOMIC_FUNDAMENTAL do you refer ? 
11830	2458	Not 50 matters since one is `` theoretical . 
11831	2458	`` Prior to ASPECT_ECONOMIC_DOWNTURN , one where YOU spent ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_MONEY , took from 1929 until 1946 and World war to correct . 
11832	2458	times government has lowered taxes and got out of way of ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR to allow economy to recover on WAY , and WAY has . 
11833	2458	And here is `` basic economic truth for you . 
11834	2458	present recession is 100 fault of term meddling in business by politicians of both parties . 
11835	2458	Politicians , no matter what label politicians attach to POLITICIANS caused housing , financial and securities troubles with laws politicians have passed and laws politicians repealed . 
11836	2458	To look to politicians to correct problem that POLITICIANS ignore POLITICIANS created is height , or depth , of folly . 
11837	2459	Just out today for you : ASPECT_US manufacturing activity hits 2004 highwashington &#8212; ASPECT_US manufacturing grew for 19th straight month in February as jump in employment and production drove activity to nearly six-year high , ASPECT_INDUSTRY_SURVEY showed Tuesday . 
11838	2459	Employment also rose 2.8 ASPECT_PERCENTAGE_POINT , to 64.5 percent , climbing above 60 percent `` for third time in decade , Ore said .

11840	2459	mere coincidence ? 
11841	2459	conservative friends would have you believe . 
11842	2459	bi-partisan cbo says otherwise . 
11843	2461	I will not be voting for idiot ASPECT_OBAMA . 
11844	2461	And for Dems to be up in arms over what 's going on in ASPECT_WISCONSIN is fairly hypocritical after things ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_PELOSI shoved down ASPECT_AMERICAN peoples throats ! 
11845	2461	I am betting we get newt gingrich\/allen west ticket elected in 2012 ! 
11846	2462	ones I directly referred to in I post . 
11847	2462	Revenue dropping in recession is not theoretical , FACT established basic fact . 
11848	2462	Not sure why your debating economics when you dont even understand basics . 
11849	2462	When you say ` meddling ' I hope you are referring to deregulation allowed financial sector to run wild and eventually impode . 
11850	2462	DEREGULATION ASPECT_DIRECT_RESULT of not enough goverment meddling or regulation . 
11851	2462	caused problem , and ASPECT_REPUBLICANS have ensured , problem remains not fixed , although PROBLEM almost certain that ASPECT_OBAMA also never wanted PROBLEM fixed ASPECT_OBAMA becauuse would upset OBAMA corporate masters . 
11852	2463	I am certain that I understand economics far better than you . 
11853	2463	Yes government revenue is very likely to drop in recession . 
11854	2463	But revenue did not drop by 4 trillion dollars . 
11855	2463	And ASPECT_GOVT_SPENDING is but one possible way to help in recession . 
11856	2463	And it is possibly worst way , as dollar Government spends is dollar taken out of economy , since economy IS source of govt money . 
11857	2463	so called deregulation was repeal of standing effective regs for new regs of political expediency . 
11858	2463	And you can forget about Republicans taking blame . 
11859	2463	And I AM NOT Republican , and never have been registered republican , but once was ASPECT_REGISTERED_DEMOCRAT . 
11860	2463	BOTH parties caused present day problems . 
11861	2463	Not with deregulation but with exchanging good regulations for bad regulations . 
11862	2463	wise and well considered regulation is necessary . 
11863	2463	But creating securities out of sub-prime loans is not good regulation . 
11864	2463	Nor is passing laws led to creation of sub-prime loans . 
11865	2463	And new financial regulations are hastily slapped together mish-mash of ill considered ASPECT_POLITICAL_POSTURING will cause problems than solve . 
11866	2463	And will cost public untold millions of dollars in unnecessary bureaucratic fees . 
11867	2463	And `` corporate masters certainly should be Flogged on hourly basis . 
11868	2463	Look what do to MASTERS . 
11869	2463	provide essentially of nations jobs . 
11870	2463	Pay bulk of MASTERS taxes . 
11871	2463	Provide good , product , and service you desire . 
11872	2463	You should skip trying to talk economics when YOU have n't shred of clue what economics are about . 
11873	2464	goverment spending goes back into economy , economy not taking out , and if SPENDING directed properly SPENDING has best stimulus multiplier . 
11874	2464	Unemployment benefits for example is maybe highest multiplier because SPENDING spent so quickly and so different industries profit from SPENDING . 
11875	2464	What in ur opinion is better way to stimulate demand in economy , other than directly creating jobs programs or giving money to people to spend ? 
11876	2464	Let me guess , ASPECT_TAX_CUT ? 
11877	2464	people sure helped economy in decade didnt people ? 
11879	2464	In words deregulation , as reducing restrictions and control of what financial industry can do . 
11880	2464	WHAT ok THEY can say word . 
11881	2464	Again thats called deregulation , and ME agree both sides are to blame . 
11882	2464	No they dont , not richest percent . 
11883	2464	They play strong factor in areas though but that does not justify they bribing and corrupting ASPECT_POLITICAL_SYSTEM and exploiting country . 
11884	2466	de reg late -LRB- d-rgy-lt -rrb- tr . 
11885	2466	v. de reg lat ed , de reg lat ing , de reg latesto free from regulation , especially to remove government regulations from : If ASPECT_ING was right word I would not hesitate to use ASPECT_ING . 
11886	2466	But replacing good regulation with bad one is still regulation , not deregulation . 
11887	2466	politicians did not create situation where `` anything goes ! 
11888	2466	POLITICIANS created one where SITUATION was regulated to `` ridiculous nonsense can not possibly last , goes ! 
11889	2466	`` Politicians can not conceive of idea of DEregulation . 
11890	2466	To politician , must be regulated to POLITICIANS best advantage . 
11891	2466	media misuses word deregulation , and others , often . 
11892	2467	If ASPECT_OBAMA would have produced ASPECT_CHANGE_OBAMA promised ASPECT_OBAMA would not be so detested even by ASPECT_OBAMA_PRIOR_SUPPORTER . 
11893	2467	country does need change . 
11894	2467	So sorry to see that ASPECT_OBAMA did n't deliver anything but ASPECT_TAX_DOLLAR to crooks . 
11895	2467	I expected as much from ASPECT_BUSH etc but not ASPECT_OBAMA . 
11897	2468	intent and perception might be important if ASPECT_TEA_PARTY was failing . 
11898	2468	However they are doing opposite , instead of failing THEY are kicking political butt and taking names . 
11899	2468	Why should THEY change anything ? 
11900	2468	Oh my friend , if you like ASPECT_GOOGLE try Googleing ` ASPECT_TEA_PARTY succeeds ' and you can pick from About 134,000,000 results -LRB- 0.40 seconds -RRB- . 
11902	2469	Very true . 
11903	2469	I think you speak for with words . 
11904	2471	What really needs to happen is making banking system less tyrannical . 
11906	2471	but nevermind . 
11907	2472	I ca n't think of . 
11908	2473	How does pic equate to racism , let alone connection to less government , lower taxes , and skin color ? 
11909	2473	Try again . 
11910	2474	Good point . 
11911	2474	Why would thing photo of ASPECT_OBAMA dressed as ASPECT_AFRICAN medicine man has anything to do with race at ? 
11912	2474	Good lord . 
11913	2475	Is picture from tea parties site ? 
11915	2475	lower taxes and smaller government does n't have anything to do with race . 
11916	2475	Again , epic fail by ASPECT_US . 
11917	2475	Show us where ideals of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY invoke race . 
11918	2476	-LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- , ASPECT_MDF we are agreeing too much ! 
11919	2476	ha ha . 
11920	2476	I have changed is to attempt to explain I core ideas with bit detail , I am happy that WE have found common ground . 
11921	2476	At I was very optimistic about ASPECT_OBAMA . 
11922	2476	However , I noticed things put I at unease , still I hoped . 
11923	2476	Then , I learned of obama voting record on late term abortion and -LRB- moral\/religious issues -RRB- gave I even reason to drop ASPECT_OBAMA . 
11924	2476	Finally , I dropped I support for ASPECT_OBAMA even before nations financial problems and before ASPECT_OBAMA tried to appease gop etc. . 
11925	2476	Thanks for your reply ~ ra 
11926	2477	Ignorance is bliss . 
11928	2477	and you must be very blissfull . 
11929	2477	ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE was caused by ASPECT_BUSH due to : Lowering interest rates to zeroIncreasing money supplyAllowing credit default swaps -LRB- CDS -RRB- made legal in 2000 after being illegal since eary 1900 ` sgiving mortgages to people with no creditthere were rumors about freddy and fanny insolvency as early as 2005 . 
11930	2477	By time ASPECT_OBAMA got in . 
11932	2477	two years spending was already committed . 
11934	2477	One does not turn titanic around on dime . 
11935	2477	Now however ASPECT_BUSH can be blamed no more . 
11936	2477	What needed to be done in years budget is ASPECT_MASSIVE_SPENDING_CUT . 
11938	2477	needs to include cuts to ASPECT_MILITARY_SPENDING and philosophy of trying to police world . 
11939	2477	place I here comming from is Libertarian party . 
11941	2477	and . 
11941	2477	aint gettin elected . 
11942	2477	Blame yourself for not voting for . 
11942	2477	. 
11944	2477	and misplacing blame . 
11946	2478	summarily condemn ASPECT_TEA_PARTY using msnbc and or open society foundation flavor instant koolaid propaganda as catalyst -LRB- just add ignorance -rrb- reminds FAN how mind warping powerful good propagandist machine can be . 
11947	2478	FAN am no fan of ASPECT_FOX or news organizations . 
11948	2478	-LRB- news of today is ASPECT_NBC ASPECT_CBS ASPECT_FOX ASPECT_MSNBC etc , is in actuality fluff and entertainment productions with varying amounts of fabrication and choreographed for entertainment of target audiences . 
11949	2478	While there is information buried in productions , INFORMATION often times difficult to determine when fluff leaves off and news begins -RRB- . 
11950	2478	big news organizations are strangely similar to religion and atheism ! 
11951	2478	Ha ha ... lets see ... ASPECT_FOX are Christians , ASPECT_MSNBC are atheist with others filling in middle -RRB- FAN know what ` organizations ' will say and is Whites are better off and need less ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE , while blacks are less well off and need ASPECT_GOVERNMENT_ASSISTANCE , or words to effect . 
11952	2478	And maybe 's true , but ASPECT_HA has to do with racism but everything to do with unfair societies and world governments are led by greed and love of money . 
11953	2478	As long as situation continues fate is grimly predictable imo . 
11955	2480	liberals and blacks will claim LIBERALS are uncle toms for not supporting ASPECT_OBAMA . 
11956	2480	LIBERALS will probably also claim you are lying or LIBERALS were paid to be there lol . 
11957	2482	Well what if ASPECT_PALIN is n't ASPECT_PALIN on ticket ? 
11958	2482	And signs lead to here not being on ticket ... 
11959	2484	ASPECT_PALIN has had her day in sun . 
11960	2484	HER continued notoriety is fueled by leftist media not being able to resist saying bad about HER . 
11961	2484	Thus keeping HER in news . 
11962	2484	There is not single ASPECT_REPUBLICAN bigwig would want HER on ticket . 
11963	2484	And I would HATE for HER to be on ticket , I 'm ASPECT_REGISTERED_INDEPENDENT . 
11964	2484	But if HER was on ticket , then I 'd have to think . 
11965	2484	Do I vote for HER , thinking HER is loose cannon , and unknown quantity . 
11966	2484	Or do I vote for incompetent obamalama knowing that he is not able to do job ? 
11967	2484	I 'd have to go with unknown quantity rather than known failure , obamalama . 
11969	2484	After 12 years of gwb and bho , is n't YEARS time capable runs for President . 
11970	2484	Do n't we deserve good one after 12 years of suffering fools ? 
11971	2486	ha ha ! 
11972	2486	Indeed why did you let em get away ? 
11973	2486	ASPECT_TEA_PARTIER ' you are ! 
11974	2486	On serious tangent I must say I do n't often do rallies , I detest crowds and organized events , well save for gun shows , ha ha comment probably damages I cred to liberals here , but ASPECT_HA fairly true ! 
11975	2486	Anyway I beleive reason that blacks are not well represented at ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_EVENT has to do with intentional racism . 
11976	2486	SUBJECT may be subject of speech etc. and that BLACKS may not feel comfortable , just as I sometimes do not feel well at what appears to be black gathering . 
11977	2486	Even though I comment may be raciest or sound somewhat racist in saying IE , ie raw words , COMMENT not meant to be racist , COMMENT simply from heart . 
11979	2487	Blacks are over 90 ASPECT_PRO obamalama . 
11980	2487	And thus , , have interest in attending tea party rally . 
11981	2487	somehow makes ASPECT_TEA_PARTIER racist according to libraloonies . 
11982	2488	Actually they are like 99 obamalama ... OBAMALAMA terrible . 
11983	2488	And whites are racists ... 
11984	2489	It was 95 , and blacks have gone over 90 for democratic candidates at least for prior two elections -LRB- kerry and ASPECT_CLINTON -rrb- . 
11985	2489	You are clueless . 
11986	2490	Well actually it was 96 you are clueless , but we know that since OBAMALAMA are Obamalama yourself . 
11987	2490	You fit into dumb 96 . 
11988	2491	His ancestry is from ASPECT_AFRICAN nation . 
11989	2491	What problem ? 
11990	2491	My ancestors are from ASPECT_NETHERLANDS . 
11991	2491	If you photo-shopped photo of MY wearing wooden shoes and rolling wheel of cheese , would that be problem in your eyes ? 
11992	2491	Not mine . 
11993	2491	No racism . 
11994	2492	Perhaps you forgot about Repubs warning about problems with fanny and freddie , and how Dems thought that was good . 
11995	2492	ASPECT_OBAMA is taking ASPECT_CAN_OPENER to Titanic . 
11996	2494	Like ASPECT_BUSH response to bill ever passed by either chamber of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN controlled ASPECT_CONGRESS in 2005 : Administration opposes billOoops . 
11997	2494	Before ASPECT_OBAMA : stimulus economy was tanking at -7 rate , losing 700,000 + jobs month , unemployment was skyrocketing , and ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET were crashing . 
11998	2494	Now : economy has been growing steadily for year and half , ASPECT_PRIVATE_SECTOR has created jobs for than year , ASPECT_STOCK_MARKET are up about 90 , and unemployment rate is falling . 
11999	2494	ship was turned around . 
12000	2494	Pretty handy use of ASPECT_CAN_OPENER . 
12001	2495	If ignorance is bliss , PERSON must be happiest person on planet . 
12002	2495	spending already committed ? 
12003	2495	Are person kidding . 
12004	2495	phony ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL . 
12005	2495	ASPECT_OBAMA huge error . 
12006	2495	Passed by partisan Democrat vote -LRB- no ASPECT_HOUSE ASPECT_REPUBLICANS for , ASPECT_SENATE 3 republicans for -RRB- at obama insistence . 
12007	2495	And perhaps you do not remember Democrats controlled both houses of ASPECT_CONGRESS from January 2007 until January 2011 . 
12008	2495	Not majority , but control for ASPECT_BUSH 2 years in office . 
12009	2495	And perhaps you also forget that ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , ASPECT_ARRA , was supposed to be for `` shovel ready `` projects to repair infrastructure according to ASPECT_OBAMA . 
12010	2495	was lie . 
12011	2495	money was used to cover Democrat states budget shortfalls . 
12012	2495	http : \ \/ \ \/ stimuluswatch.org \ \/ 2.0 \ \/ And ASPECT_HOUSING_BUBBLE was put in motion decades before ASPECT_BUSH was Governor of ASPECT_TEXAS . 
12013	2495	By both ASPECT_DEMOCRATS ASPECT_AND ASPECT_REPUBLICANS trying to buy votes from unable to buy housing . 
12015	2497	GLUTTON am not glutton for punishment ... 
12016	2498	I never said ASPECT_BUSH was ideal . 
12017	2498	ASPECT_BUSH had BUSH problems . 
12018	2498	There may be signs of recovery in spite of ASPECT_OBAMA . 
12019	2498	Do n't get too cocky yet . 
12020	2498	We may be in for hurt . 
12021	2498	Of course , will be ASPECT_BUSH fault , right ? 
12022	2499	ASPECT_BUSH was half as bad as ASPECT_OBAMA ! 
12023	2499	ASPECT_OBAMA is three times as worse as ASPECT_BUSH , with said I rest I case ... Jollee 
12024	2501	If I had choice between two , I would pick ASPECT_BUSH , but I dont trust ASPECT_BUSH , I think ASPECT_BUSH is just as bad as ASPECT_OBAMA ... JolleeJollee 
12025	2502	To me , both ASPECT_OBAMA and ASPECT_BUSH are puppets . 
12026	2502	PUPPETS are both controlled by others , whether it 's unions\/all soros groups or big ASPECT_OIL_COMPANY with ASPECT_BUSH . 
12027	2502	ME want president is does n't pander to . 
12028	2503	I agree ! 
12029	2503	I wish ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN or ASPECT_CHRIS ASPECT_CHRISTI would run for president , mostly ASPECT_PAUL ASPECT_RYAN ASPECT_RYAN is so good looking and smart , 's what we need to win ... ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN ! 
12032	2505	Hello , he can only play one significant ! 
12033	2505	I want mathematician , fact numbers man ! 
12034	2505	as well as intelligent , good looking , etc. ... I want ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN too run ! 
12035	2505	ASPECT_JOELLE , past Demo , ASPECT_MODERATE ASPECT_REPUBLICAN , ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN for President ! 
12036	2506	Yes I often get accused of racism by people including one or three members here are + students in university produced libraloonie phds . 
12037	2506	-LRB- is ASPECT_UNIVERSITY ASPECT_OF ASPECT_MSNBC and similar propaganda spewing organizations -RRB- . 
12038	2506	charge of racism and belittling terms leveled at ASPECT_TEA_PARTIER and grass root groups are rarely justified . 
12039	2506	However happily calls are becoming less and less robust as PARTIERS are systematically being discredited and name callers ie haters in play are being exposed for what CALLERS are , is liars and hatemongers . 
12040	2506	ra -LRB- DISCLAIMER ; I use libraloonies and derogatory word to denote fringe of liberals not moderate liberals of whom I have friends . 
12041	2506	Indeed I decry most if not extreme fringe groups right left or middle , because when one is at fringe , extreme fringe , that eliminates options to be rational and much like particle approaching light speed closer to -LRB- is light speed in vacuum -RRB- extreme fringe less options one has to be rational . 
12042	2506	-LRB- particle approaching light speed gains mass at 90 of not too mass is gained however at 95 particle has gained 10000 particle mass or weight , at 99 particle gains millions of times particle mass , and speed of light is never attained because amount of energy required for 100 light speed is energy than is in universe ! -RRB- 
12043	2506	hmmm ... perhaps was bad analogy ? 
12044	2506	hee hee ... ahhhh ` ra 
12045	2507	Hi jollee time no font ha ha ... Anyway DETESTER too would like fact and numbers too , but ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN ? 
12046	2507	ASPECT_RYAN has too hair , and if you think ASPECT_RYAN is good looking what does bald , bearded , and pierced guy have with you ? 
12047	2507	-LRB- just kidding ... hey JUST Monday we need to smile about ! -RRB- 
12049	2507	Right on ~ right on brother ! 
12050	2507	DETESTER am soros detester , well detester religion prevents DETESTER to detest man , detester detest man sinful and terrible nation busting ways along with man need to control WE . 
12051	2507	good about ASPECT_SOROS -LRB- and soros various organizations of which open society is soros flag ship -RRB- is that old fool is OLD ! 
12052	2507	Perhaps ASPECT_SOROS will die soon and find out for sure if God -LRB- or perhaps guy -RRB- exists or not ! 
12054	2508	Yes but if banks would of been watched by congress and regulatory groups that we elected to do WE would not be in mess nor would groups of had melt down nearly plunged WE into depression would have made 1920 look like overdrawn checking account -LRB- but not for reasons told to public , thats another thread -rrb- . 
12055	2508	I think WE will eventually start medium to world war to put 700 billion -LRB- like two trillion dollars in money etc -rrb- and that WE plugged in to currency and then stupidity gave to crooks without regulation . 
12056	2508	funny money cash infusion did narrowly avert catastrophic failure if you beleive in looney toons . 
12057	2508	But what I am trying to say is that crooks are very people WE elected -LRB- ASPECT_CONGRESS up to commanders in chief imo -RRB- in bed with very rich -LRB- is ASPECT_GOLDMAN_SACH of poo etc -rrb- . 
12058	2508	So yes YES banks but yes far more . 
12059	2508	PEOPLE are both crooks and symptoms of disease called GREED and as ASPECT_JESUS said , LOVE of money is root of evil . 
12061	2509	True true true ! 
12062	2509	I will get called guess what ? 
12063	2509	racist for saying but if whites did or said half what blacks did and do Media would be shouting raciest raciest raciest !!! 
12064	2509	One out of thousands of examples ? 
12065	2509	Here let ASPECT_GOOGLE do talking ; new black panther thugs head back to polls ; Democrat panelist ... oct 29 , 2010 ... Before philly new black panther party radicals showed up at voting booth in 2008 with billy clubs and racial epithets at ready , ... http : \ \/ \ \/ www.facebook.com\/note.php ? 
12065	2509	not ... 46984540676 & id . 
12065	2509	. 
12065	2509	What if ASPECT_KKK did ? 
12066	2509	Holy crap here would have been riot and police would have shut ASPECT_NBP down with swat response . 
12067	2509	No police am 100 against old klan just like nbp movement . 
12069	2510	With due respect I beleive was using 99 figure as talking point and was not meant to be taken seriously . 
12071	2512	Maybe was his plan . 
12072	2513	ASPECT_PAUL_RYAN and ASPECT_CHRISTIE are also puppets . 
12073	2513	dr. ASPECT_RON ASPECT_PAUL is man to trust . 
12074	2513	Check out paul voting record over thirty years . 
12075	2513	Proof is in facts ! 
12076	2515	I like ASPECT_RON_PAUL for his position on isolationism , ASPECT_PAUL isn t true isolationist but is nearest we have . 
12077	2515	If you dig ASPECT_PAUL -LRB- as I do -RRB- take time to read ; http : \ \/ \ \/ www.swamppolitics.com \ \/ news\/po ... _ isnt_wha . 
12077	2515	htmlra 
12078	2516	Not bad but we need is electable . 
12079	2516	I like ASPECT_HUCKABEE for reasons , primary reason is ASPECT_HUCKABEE_FAITH . 
12080	2516	Yes I know gives people shudders and nervous tic to go with TIC ! 
12081	2516	And while relgious right will vote for ASPECT_HUCK just for reason , moderates will run away for reason . 
12082	2516	I would love to see huckabee and mccain -LRB- huckabee age and hawkness ' is liability -RRB- for ASPECT_GOP_TICKET . 
12083	2516	However and get ready to Gag , I personal favorite not being Republican nor Democrat etc would be ron paul and ? 
12085	2516	ha no. . 
12087	2516	hmmm ' ~ ra 
12088	2517	ASPECT_HUCKABEE would be my choice . 
12089	2517	ASPECT_HUCKABEE_FAITH matters little to MY , but ASPECT_HUCKABEE mean bass player ! 
12090	2518	Why use ` ASPECT_NAZI_GERMANY ' as comparison . 
12091	2518	I thought we got into war because japanese bombed pearl harbor ? 
12092	2519	We did . 
12093	2520	YOU am happy that you can see past mans faith . 
12094	2520	YOU beleive if everyone were like you -LRB- not religion phobic -rrb- , ASPECT_HUCK would be electable . 
12095	2520	ASPECT_HUCK may still be because religious right is quite voting block . 
12096	2520	Personally speaking , if two men were running and one was complete dweeb in politics but true christian , ie pro life pro second amendment pro traditional values etc , and was brilliant politician but pro abortion anti firearm anti traditional values dweeb YOU would vote for christian time . 
12097	2520	Scary huh ? 
12099	2521	Who knows reason we finally got into WW2 ? 
12100	2521	If WE were living in my ASPECT_DREAM_WORLD where western hemisphere were isolated -LRB- except for cultural and knowledge sharing -RRB- my would find non-interference difficult concept to adhere if world was at war and say another hitler was winning , not to help we fellows . 
12101	2521	However , if we former allies knew from beginning that non-interference was we policy my think obeying policy would be morally and ethically correct . 
12102	2521	Anyway , are you responding to ? 
12103	2521	; &#8220; well , first off , ASPECT_IRAQ is not ASPECT_NAZI_GERMANY , &#8217; &#8217; paul said today on ASPECT_CNN &#8217; s late edition with wolf blitzer . 
12104	2521	&#8220; and besides , MY thought it was ASPECT_HITLER caused World ASPECT_WAR_II , not ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE , who opposed going in . 
12105	2521	So &#8220; did n't make sense . 
12106	2521	And then ASPECT_HITLER was awfully confused about isolationism versus non-intervention . 
12107	2521	There is big difference . 
12108	2521	&#8220; isolationism is n't what my advocate , &#8217; &#8217; paul told ASPECT_BLITZER . 
12109	2521	&#8220; my advocate non-intervention , not getting involved in internal affairs of nations , and not pretending country like ASPECT_IRAQ is equivalent to ASPECT_NAZI_GERMANY . 
12110	2521	ASPECT_IRAQ had no army , no navy , had no weapons of mass destruction , had to do with 9\/11 , so comparison makes no sense . 
12111	2521	`` If not what do you mean by YOU comment ? 
12112	2521	Thanks for YOU reply ... ra 
12113	2522	Not really , i would too . 
12114	2524	I would consider you I brother then , unless your religion is lavey satanism or would do violence to others as matter of doctrine . 
12116	2525	ME agree with most of excerpts conclusions . 
12117	2525	will surprise members know ME . 
12118	2525	people mistake me for radical right wing conservative ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
12119	2525	ME am none of things really . 
12120	2525	me religion is open theist christian . 
12121	2525	me reality\/paradigm is determined by me religion , which leads to misconception that ME am conservative etc. . 
12122	2525	ME think ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY are ultimately corrupted by love of money . 
12123	2525	me religion based paradigm is simplistic but accurate\/true . 
12124	2525	For example , in physics simple isn &#8217; t complex equations give us best answers to things , but rather SIMPLE very simple and elegant ones describe complex things better ! 
12125	2525	Case in point ; = MC2 ! 
12126	2525	holds true when trying to assess complex system like ASPECT_US ASPECT_POLITICAL_SYSTEM with system seemingly infinite myriad branches trunk and roots are life support is bewildering complex botany of plants . 
12127	2525	So ASPECT_US must look at tree as whole and not try to take TREE apart . 
12128	2525	Sorry me got off on tangent ! 
12129	2525	Anyway there is complex about ASPECT_US failures , one of them can be traced back to Greed and love of money , just as great man\/god once said about 2000 years ago . 
12130	2525	open christian theism can best be described as liberal christianity . 
12131	2525	ASPECT_US still must validate ASPECT_US beliefs by scripture but non traditional answers and are accepted and studied where in ordinary seminary or church ideas would be summarily rejected . 
12133	2527	Yes 96 was 96 , but if you really want to see racism RACISM 's in his approval numbers . 
12134	2527	I checked while back to carter none of guys were in ninety except ASPECT_OBAMA , I believe if I remember correctly carter always had about 7 point advantage . 
12135	2527	Now here GUYS are , no jobs , , and carter is still over 90 approval with GUYS , , , go figure . 
12136	2527	means least them do for them GUYS like you , , , -LRB- If your black is -RRB- hahahahahahanybody says heavy racism is not involved is just full of crap , GUYS are sooo frightened to be un pc nuts ... or rather GUYS dont have nuts ... Now is what GUYS want you to believe , people with highest percentage wise on welfare , people with highest crime percentage , people with heaviest arrest percentages would never stoop so low as to be prejudice ... hahahahahahahaha yup , , , 's where GUYS draw line ... GUYS would never treat white person unfairly , murder , dope , prostitution , rape , , but Prejudice ? 
12137	2527	... NEVER !! 
12138	2527	LOLIt sad , THEM just can not trust anything from liberals mouth , just like with them trying to condemn ASPECT_TEA_PARTY when LOLIT THEM involved in violence , and stopping of free speech as well . 
12139	2527	So besides crap do out right lie about ASPECT_LOLIT as well , even when lolit is put right in front of ... know are not fooling anybody , I guess figure what got to lose , and if catch people out there are ignorant enough may get to believe garbage . 
12140	2527	Man , I am glad I am not in mess . 
12141	2527	compared party to donkey kong day ... LOL 
12142	2528	Dems knew exactly what they were doing , how do you make one of largest transfers of wealth ? 
12143	2528	estate , , make ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS lose fortunes on values on they homes , and who steps in to profit from MIND ? 
12144	2528	, why MIND poor , now homes are affordable , never mind that you just stole MIND from ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS who needed money to retire ... Yup , , , slick ... and people do not even question MIND ... Remember Barny goal , make housing affordable to poor , , , , BARNY just did .

12180	2535	I apologize for I abrasive of ascerbic terms and words . 
12181	2535	I misunderstood your prior post . 
12182	2537	No problem ... I have read of your posts , , I find you interesting . 
12183	2537	I was reading one thread in particular where you were having trouble in your neighborhood , , I feel bad for you . 
12185	2537	I always took train when I was working , and worked in bad area for over thirty years . 
12186	2537	DAY like day and night living in I neighborhood and station that I office was near . 
12187	2537	I always hated fact I had to dress down when I went to work , if you did n't you stood good chance of getting robbed . 
12188	2537	Awful days we are Living in Al , , , mighty awful ... I was having problem keeping I office door open to get fresh air inside , so I purchased very unusual lamp chain , ONE was one enough for I purpose , , so I attached days and days worked . 
12189	2537	I employee said , , Boss you cant leave chain half outside like MIGHTY will steal DAYS , I said for God sakes DAYS small lamp chain , she said LEAVE does n't matter LEAVE shiny , , I laughed ... Following day following was gone , I did n't know if I should burst out Laughing or get so angry I wanted to choke . 
12190	2537	I mean really lamp chain ? 
12191	2537	and CHAIN was screwed on to outside wall of office , MIGHTY had to rip CHAIN out and cause damage . 
12192	2537	Who could be stupid ? 
12193	2537	who could need lamp chain that bad ? 
12194	2537	who could care that little about another persons property ? 
12195	2537	PROPERTY was absurd . 
12196	2537	afternoon I walked to Deli to get lunch and there was usual bunch of ill mannered trouble making Bastards in there . 
12197	2537	I noticed one kid he was about ten I guess , KID was wearing I chain around KID neck with pride ... is what we are up against , and if you stay on pages long enough you will learn how incident was I fault . 
12198	2537	You see time hundred years ago white guy had slaves ... Well you know rest of story . 
12199	2537	Al , had I walked in I house as kid and had chain around I neck I parents would have said ... '' Whats that ? 
12200	2537	, where did you get from ? 
12201	2537	, did you buy AL ? 
12202	2537	, where did you get money ? 
12203	2537	what store ? 
12204	2537	I am telling you Sir , we coddle people like , PC WE dump out there worse pc will get , and SIR already worse I guess word I am looking for is worster ... lol people have to look into PEOPLE , PEOPLE have to recognize problem and admit one , not to I but to PEOPLE . 
12205	2537	SIR home . 
12207	2537	-LRB- If you want to call . -RRB- 
12207	2537	, kids are having kids without being kids yet KIDS ... KIDS have no regard for anybody kids , WE were humble toward we adults , kids attack kids , WE were respectful , KIDS talk trash , WE were there to help , kids help kids . 
12208	2537	Calling things as WE see KIDS is not wrong , what wrong is ignoring , making excuses , and expecting no better ... 'S WRONG ! 
12209	2537	If KIDS do not fix homes country will blow sky high and ASPECT_AA , and welfare checks wont make difference , after KIDS have been taught kids deserve kids and kids actions are we responsibility , there are no consequences for KIDS , respect is not you earn , COUNTRY is gotten through intimidation or demanded for you by Government . 
12210	2537	resentments are held ASPECT_DEEP_INSIDE and not voicing outrage is not only not healthy for society but country will give you agida ... -LRB- italian heartburn -rrb- . 
12211	2537	I am not saying you run around with broad brush day but when you see so obvious there is wrong in stating so , otherwise how do KIDS even know BRUSH wrong ? 
12212	2537	WE are aware and know times brush is not corrected in household so in balance we are doing ... ONES are now ones ignoring chain ... . 
12213	2539	Off hand I would say you are fairly certain ... . 
12214	2540	is patently racist hate speech ! 
12215	2540	No wonder people call you racist . 
12216	2540	post , in post entirety , is n't sarcasm POST just revolting , repulsive , and hateful . 
12217	2540	People are people - no matter what color people are . 
12218	2540	people , if not , are prejudiced about or , but stuff written in post is beyond forgiveness or even ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE . 
12219	2540	KID was kid in ASPECT_DETROIT race riots in 1967 . 
12220	2540	We lived in urban catholic ASPECT_POLISH neighborhood with Hispanics . 
12221	2540	KID stepfather was ASPECT_ARMY scout in ASPECT_PHILIPPINES in WWII for 2 years when average life span in assignment was less than 3 months . 
12222	2540	PERSON was expert marksman and about as tough as HISPANICS come . 
12223	2540	person and one ASPECT_AMERICAN soldier worked and lived with philippine aborigine insurgents against Japanese . 
12224	2540	PERSON had to kill people to stay alive . 
12225	2540	Yet , PERSON was gentle , fair-minded person kid have ever known . 
12226	2540	In civilian life , PERSON was letter carrier and loved person job . 
12227	2540	When PERSON died , than 300 people showed up at person funeral . 
12228	2540	PERSON taught KID respect for people and that who hate and spout hate think have good reason to do so , but hatred wo n't change world into what want . 
12229	2540	PERSON told KID that common sense and understanding can and does change attitudes . 
12230	2540	Life is not fair to . 
12231	2540	Not economically , physically , intellectually . 
12232	2540	No one promised ME or me rose garden without thorns in ONE . 
12233	2543	No , would be ASPECT_BUSH . 
12234	2544	His presidency is n't even over yet . 
12235	2544	's rather presumptuous of you . 
12236	2545	It 'll be both . 
12237	2546	ASPECT_OBAMA will be worse than ASPECT_BUSH . 
12238	2547	Not possible . 
12239	2548	What so bad about ASPECT_BUSH ? 
12240	2548	If you say economy , what has ASPECT_OBAMA_DONE to improve ECONOMY . 
12241	2548	If you say war in ASPECT_IRAQ and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN , why are we still there ? 
12242	2549	Wrongly elected , stupid , was tied to oil and ASPECT_GAS_COMPANY , environmental policies sucked , too vacations , tied his christianity to politics , patriot act and loss of freedoms , bad ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY led to rising debt , should not have privatized ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY , was not respected abroad , never admitted to bad decisions . 
12243	2549	Shall i go on ? 
12244	2550	I think it world will look disparagingly at ASPECT_OBAMA , if WORLD ever gets off world puffed up pc color coddling butt . 
12246	2551	list nearly described president in history . 
12247	2551	As far as binding his christianity to HIS politics thank god his did . 
12248	2551	Personally I think modern west which includes ASPECT_USA ASPECT_ENGLAND etc is manifestation of templar era christianity ie Crusaders and ASPECT_CHRISTENDOM in general . 
12249	2551	We have historical dna of crusaders in we blood . 
12250	2551	Being proud of ones religion and even allowing RELIGION to influence policy is lot better ASPECT_OBAMA immoral unethical ways and ASPECT_OBAMA like instilled goon squad of hair ball advisers . 
12251	2551	Throw in Obamas broken promises , OBAMA lying unethical ways , and you will have visual of man that ASPECT_OBAMA really is . 
12252	2551	Oh I forgot to add ASPECT_OBAMA is inexperienced -LRB- excutivally speaking -RRB- . 
12253	2551	I think ASPECT_OBAMA was far worse than ASPECT_BUSH . 
12254	2551	I am no fan of ASPECT_IRAQ_WAR , but somewhat support ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN war . 
12255	2551	As Christian I I admire ASPECT_BUSH for being proud that ASPECT_OBAMA is Christian , ASPECT_OBAMA on hand is anything that ASPECT_BUSH needs to be , black , white , oreo , late term abortion champion ... no thanks ! 
12256	2551	I would go so far to say that ASPECT_OBAMA is worst president in since ASPECT_JAMES ASPECT_BUCHANAN , no. . 
12258	2551	. 
12258	2551	is worse than even that buffoon . 
12259	2551	. 
12259	2551	color is of no consequence , but . 
12259	2551	ignorance , stupidity and naivety is . 
12260	2551	again is speaking in purely abstract terms and generalities . 
12261	2551	We also have muslim blood etc. . 
12264	2552	ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA , during ASPECT_OBAMA_CAIRO_SPEECH , said : `` ASPECT_OBAMA know , too , that Islam has always been part of ASPECT_AMERICA story . 
12265	2552	ASPECT_AMERICAN citizen RESPONSE : Dear mr. obama : Were Muslims were in ASPECT_AMERICA when Pilgrims first landed ? 
12266	2552	Funny , I thought they were native american indians . 
12267	2552	Were Muslims celebrated thanksgiving day ? 
12268	2552	Sorry again , were pilgrims and native american indians . 
12269	2552	Can you show I one muslim signature on ASPECT_UNITED_STATE_CONSTITUTION ? 
12270	2552	Declaration of Independence ? 
12271	2552	bill of rights ? 
12272	2552	Did n't think so . 
12273	2552	Did Muslims fight for country freedom from ASPECT_ENGLAND ? 
12275	2552	Did Muslims fight during civil war to free slaves in ASPECT_AMERICA ? 
12276	2552	No , no did not . 
12277	2552	In fact , Muslims to day are still largest traffickers in human slavery . 
12278	2552	Your half brother , devout muslim , still advocates slavery muslim , even though Muslims of arabic descent refer to black muslims as `` pug nosed slaves . 
12279	2552	Says lot of what ASPECT_MUSLIM_WORLD really thinks of your family `` rich islamic heritage , does n't LOT ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_OBAMA ? 
12280	2552	Where were Muslims during civil rights era of country ? 
12281	2552	Not present . 
12282	2552	There are no pictures or media accounts of Muslims walking side by side with martin luther king , Jr. or helping to advance cause of ASPECT_CIVIL_RIGHT . 
12283	2552	Where were Muslims during country Woman 's suffrage era ? 
12284	2552	Again , not present . 
12285	2552	In fact , devout muslims demand that women are subservient to men in islamic culture . 
12286	2552	So much so , that often WOMEN are beaten for not wearing ` hajib ' or for talking to man who is not direct family member or women husband . 
12287	2552	Yep , ASPECT_MUSLIMS are for women rights , are n't WOMEN ? 
12288	2552	Where were muslims during World ASPECT_WAR_II ? 
12289	2552	WOMEN were aligned with adolf hitler . 
12290	2552	muslim grand mufti muslim met with ASPECT_ADOLF ASPECT_HITLER , reviewed troops and accepted support from Nazi in killing Jews . 
12291	2552	Finally , ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_OBAMA , where were muslims on sept. 11th , 2001 ? 
12292	2552	If MUFTI were n't flying planes into World ASPECT_TRADE_CENTER , ASPECT_PENTAGON or field in ASPECT_PENNSYLVANIA killing nearly 3,000 people on soil , MUFTI were rejoicing in ASPECT_MIDDLE_EAST . 
12293	2552	No one can dispute pictures shown from parts of ASPECT_MUSLIM_WORLD celebrating on ASPECT_CNN , ASPECT_FOX news , MSNBC and cable news networks that day . 
12294	2552	Strangely , very `` moderate muslims who asses you bent over backwards to kiss in ASPECT_CAIRO , ASPECT_EGYPT on June 4th were stone cold silent post 9-11 . 
12295	2552	To Americans , mufti silence has meant approval for acts of day . 
12296	2552	And , ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_OBAMA , is `` rich heritage muslims have here in ASPECT_AMERICA ... Oh , I 'm sorry , HERITAGE forgot to mention barbary pirates . 
12297	2552	HERE were ASPECT_MUSLIM . 
12298	2552	And now we can add November 5 , 2009 - slaughter of ASPECT_AMERICAN soldiers at fort hood by muslim major who is doctor and psychiatrist who was supposed to be counseling soldiers returning from battle in ASPECT_IRAQ and ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN . 
12299	2552	, ASPECT_MR. ASPECT_OBAMA is `` muslim heritage in ASPECT_AMERICA . 
12300	2552	ASPECT_AMERICAN must read !! 
12301	2552	Be sure to SEND NOW TO . 
12302	2552	muslim heritage , I ass umption . 
12303	2553	Color has to do with COLOR , unless you 're racist . 
12304	2554	Color does have to do with it and you need not be racist to believe that unless you believe blacks who voted for ASPECT_OBAMA because of ASPECT_OBAMA_SKIN_COLOR are racists . 
12305	2554	ASPECT_OBAMA was given pass for of part of ASPECT_OBAMA_TERM because of ASPECT_OBAMA_SKIN_COLOR . 
12306	2554	ASPECT_OBAMA was supposed to be ` golden child ' , one to bring races together . 
12307	2554	Instead , ASPECT_OBAMA has pushed races further apart . 
12308	2554	ASPECT_OBAMA has done by things as jumping into cop and professor case and declaring police force idiots without knowing what had actually happened in case . 
12309	2554	ASPECT_OBAMA has done by allowing ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_JUSTICE ASPECT_DEPARTMENT to not prosecute new black panther party members who intimidated voters at polls . 
12310	2554	ASPECT_OBAMA has done by referring to ASPECT_OBAMA white grandmother as ` typical white person ' . 
12311	2554	ASPECT_OBAMA presidency has proven to be unmitigated disaster and question asked at title of thread should be changed from , Will you vote for ASPECT_OBAMA in 2012 , to , Will anyone vote for ASPECT_OBAMA in 2012 ? 
12312	2555	Your rhetoric only applies to 3 of above . 
12313	2555	ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_OBAMA have been presidents , so how can you judge 3 as ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_MATERIAL ? 
12314	2555	I voted for ASPECT_OBAMA . 
12315	2555	I did not vote for ASPECT_OBAMA because ASPECT_OBAMA is black , but because ASPECT_OBAMA proved during debates that ASPECT_MCCAIN was fool -LRB- especially with ASPECT_MCCAIN pick for VP in ditherhead palin -rrb- meaning , `` there 's no fool like ` old ' fool . 
12316	2555	Further proof is ASPECT_MCCAIN record since election which is even worse than MEANING was before election . 
12317	2555	As for who `` screwed up country , there can be no worse jerk than ditherhead , bratboy ASPECT_BUSH . 
12318	2555	FOR totally relied on ASPECT_CHENEY , another `` stoup who used FOR wife money and wife family to get ahead in politics because FOR could n't get anywhere on FOR own . 
12319	2555	FOR truly is human face of darth vader , except Vader was fictional warrior and ASPECT_CHENEY never was . 
12320	2555	is guy who shot friend in face and then had friend apologize for being in front of gun . 
12321	2555	ASPECT_CHENEY has always had `` heart problem . 
12322	2555	Now NOW truly as `` artificial and empty as cheney brain was from birth . 
12323	2555	Two shriveled pea brains in shriveled pee pod : bratboy ASPECT_BUSH and `` ASPECT_DICK ASPECT_CHENEY . 
12324	2555	They and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN ASPECT_NEOCONS are 100 responsible for absolutely asinine dilemma ASPECT_USA is in today -LRB- recession caused by out of control wall street greed , negligent republican appointed regulators and enforcers , and republican inspired , balloon-headed notion that ASPECT_USA could control oil fields in just because THEY are lone super power . 
12325	2555	Nobody , even simple minded dems can take credit for mess . 
12326	2555	SIMPLE belongs to Republicans . 
12327	2555	And who tries to explain mess away ASPECT_WAY_CONSERVATIVE and ASPECT_ADDLEBRAINED_TEA_PARTY is trying to do is . 
12328	2556	What load of horse -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- ! 
12329	2556	Muslims have been part of ASPECT_AMERICAN_HISTORY since pre-columbus times . 
12330	2556	Indeed , early explorers used maps were derived from work of Muslims , with EXPLORERS advanced geographical and navigational information of time . 
12331	2556	scholars estimate that 10-20 percent of slaves brought over from ASPECT_AFRICA were Muslims . 
12332	2556	film `` amistad alluded to fact , portraying Muslims aboard slave vessel trying to perform scholars prayers , while chained together on deck as SCHOLARS crossed ASPECT_ATLANTIC . 
12333	2556	personal narratives and histories are harder to find , but stories have been passed on from reliable sources : omar ibn said -LRB- ca . 
12334	2556	1770-1864 -rrb- was born in muslim state of futa toro in ASPECT_WESTERN ASPECT_AFRICA , in present-day senegal . 
12335	2556	MUSLIM was muslim scholar and trader who was captured and enslaved . 
12336	2556	MUSLIM arrived in south carolina in 1807 , and was sold to james owen of north carolina . 
12337	2556	sali-bul ali was slave on plantation . 
12338	2556	ali owner ASPECT_JAMES ASPECT_COOPER wrote : `` ALI is strict mahometan -LRB- sic -rrb- ; abstains from spirituous liquors , and keeps various fasts , particularly that of ASPECT_RAMADAN ... ASPECT_LAMEN ASPECT_KEBE was slave who used to be school teacher in ASPECT_AFRICA . 
12339	2556	cooper shared information about texts and teaching methods used in islamic schools of cooper country . 
12340	2556	abdul rahman ibrahim sori spent 40 years in slavery before ASPECT_SORI returned to ASPECT_AFRICA to die . 
12341	2556	SORI wrote two autobiographies , and signed charcoal sketch of SORI by ASPECT_HENRY ASPECT_INMAN , which was featured on cover of `` ASPECT_FREEDMAN ASPECT_JOURNAL and is on display in ASPECT_LIBRARY ASPECT_OF ASPECT_CONGRESS . 
12342	2556	of muslim slaves were encouraged or forced to convert to Christianity . 
12343	2556	of first-generation slaves retained much of muslim identity , but under harsh slavery conditions identity was largely lost to later generations . 
12344	2557	Were Jews there too ? 
12345	2557	At ASPECT_AMERICA beginning ? 
12346	2557	I think not . 
12347	2557	I great great great grand maternal ancestors were here long before Christian european or middle east jew or muslim set foot on continent . 
12348	2557	If native americans had been treated with fraction of `` guilt induced largess jews received after WWII , ANCESTORS would be part of ASPECT_AMERICAN political aristocracy today . 
12349	2557	I have no sympathy for ASPECT_ISRAEL `` humanitarian behavior today . 
12350	2557	historian would question if ASPECT_ISRAELI conservatives in power today learned anything from holocaust . 
12351	2557	When Old testament wantonly says hebrew god mandates living opposed to jewish settlements be slaughtered\/exterminated : men , women , children , live stock and planted fields suggests to I that men religion cares as little for men enemies as MEN infamously impose upon MEN Muslim neighbors . 
12352	2557	Therefore , `` Let MEN who are without sin cast stone ! 
12353	2557	I think your post is without merit or foundation in your argument ! 
12354	2558	ASPECT_OBAMA presidency is n't over yet . 
12355	2558	How can you compare ASPECT_OBAMA 2 year term so far with unmitigated , colossal failure of bratboy ASPECT_BUSH 8 years . 
12356	2558	ASPECT_BUSH had virtual control over country with neocon republicans running show for ASPECT_BUSH . 
12357	2558	What little power Dems did to curtail ASPECT_BUSH conservative shenanigans , ASPECT_BUSH made null and void by `` signing statements . 
12358	2558	And , to ridicule of BUSH statements compared with statements now being broadcast by ASPECT_FOX ASPECT_NEWS -LRB- news ? -RRB- 
12359	2558	, religious conservatives and teabaggers is loathsome . 
12360	2558	We say things WE wished WE had not . 
12361	2558	I , too , have problems with of things ASPECT_BUSH said , but ASPECT_BUSH is n't saint just because ASPECT_BUSH President . 
12362	2558	ASPECT_MICHELLE ASPECT_BACHMAN is close to being standup comedian with of stuff comes out of her mouth along with ASPECT_HUCKABEE , ASPECT_GINGRICH , ASPECT_SANTORUM , ASPECT_PALIN , et al. who aspire to run for President year . 
12363	2559	So you voted for him because you did n't think HIM was as bad as candidate ? 
12364	2559	People should vote for who is best , and there should be list of good enough candidates so we should n't have to vote for whoever wo n't screw up country worst . 
12365	2560	Cool post ! 
12367	2561	Cool post # 2 ! 
12370	2562	No i disagree , problem is decades crimes of money and power orientated politicians in both parties . 
12371	2562	POLITICIANS are evil separated only by degrees of sin . 
12372	2562	I can usually tell when is losing by how intense ASPECT_NAME_CALLING gets ! 
12373	2562	ASPECT_LIBERAL ASPECT_DEMOCRATS must be beyond losing ! 
12374	2562	Ha ha ... Anyway ~ ` ASPECT_ADDLEBRAINED_TEA_PARTY ' is going to continue to roll on baby , democrats rule , handing dems democrats ass at turn it seems . 
12375	2562	I am not conservative nor liberal , -LRB- I vote issues on individual basis -RRB- just observer but have watched ASPECT_TEA_PARTY be ridiculed by MSNBC -LRB- crappy liberal ASPECT_NEWS_STATION blown out of water by conservative pro ASPECT_BUSH fox -RRB- and liberals that come out of woodwork to -LRB- attempt to -RRB- bash LIBERALS only to be made look like fools as teaparty steam rolls liberals as easily as squashing hapless bug . 
12376	2562	In fact liberals roll over opposes LIBERALS . 
12377	2562	If you oppose liberals sassy , I recommend you use other than rhetoric against LIBERALS , or you too will be mauled by mean political machine called ASPECT_TEA_PARTY . 
12379	2564	He 's on course to do . 
12380	2565	Sorry , with simplistic pov , democracy is no better than dictatorship . 
12381	2565	's fool point of view and exactly why ASPECT_HOUSE turned ASPECT_REPUBLICAN . 
12382	2565	`` cranky liberals refused to go to polls because LIBERALS did n't think ASPECT_OBAMA was `` liberal enough so teabaggers -LRB- LIBERALS are rabid minority -RRB- got TEABAGGERS Neocon vote out . 
12383	2565	What nonsense . 
12384	2565	How childish . 
12385	2565	How typical of Americans to `` pout when LIBERALS think -LRB- think ? -RRB- 
12386	2565	LIBERALS have been maltreated by liberals leadership . 
12387	2565	Liberals got gridlock liberals deserve ; conservatives got gridlock conservatives deserve and rest of us have to bite ASPECT_US lip and live with consequences . 
12388	2565	I deeply resent that perspective . 
12389	2565	Since your post suggests that not enough `` good candidates are available , pray tell I your solution to dilemma ? 
12390	2565	ASPECT_US have 2 parties in power in country and because individual `` states determine how candidate is qualified to run , powerful party makes decision . 
12391	2565	Money is usually determinate factor . 
12392	2565	Take money out of politics and that levels ASPECT_PLAYING_FIELD for candidates as well as voters . 
12394	2565	because candidates are no longer under pressure to `` reward who donate to get candidate elected . 
12395	2565	Another improvement would be to redistrict country according to Constitution , not limit to 435 districts ; begin nonpartisan redistricting according to population alone , not by ASPECT_POLITICAL_PARTY ; get rid of ASPECT_ELECTORAL_COLLEGE ; return office of president and v.p. to be voted on separately so that candidate with votes becomes President and highest vote getter becomes ASPECT_V.P. -LRB- was way it was historically done just after Constitution was adopted -RRB- . 
12396	2565	changes take `` selection power out of party politics and returns that power to voters where POWER `` should be , as you idealize . 
12397	2565	going to happen ? 
12398	2566	teabaggers are radical . 
12399	2566	Radicals tend to tune into anger ASPECT_GENERAL_POPULATION is feeling and gain popularity for time . 
12400	2566	ASPECT_EGYPT is example . 
12401	2566	people managed to overthrow `` hated head of state , but after dust settles , army remains stable organization ; and 's exactly from where ASPECT_MUBARAK rose to power . 
12402	2566	teabaggers gained power in southwest and southern republican party -LRB- democrats until ASPECT_LBJ passed ASPECT_CIVIL_RIGHT_ACT -RRB- ; from religious conservative democrats -LRB- ASPECT_BLUE_DOG -RRB- in ASPECT_MIDWEST ; and ASPECT_FOX news who has become doggerel political party using so called public owned airways . 
12403	2566	Thanks to union ASPECT_BUSTER ASPECT_RONALD ASPECT_REAGAN , once powerful ASPECT_LABOR_UNION literally `` made ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS after WWII have lost pac power ; and ASPECT_REAGAN tax aversion to public education initiatives for ASPECT_AMERICAN_CHILD , quality of educated young people in ASPECT_AMERICA has deteriorated dramatically . 
12404	2566	We rank no where near top 5 globally WE once did . 
12405	2566	Home schooling is dismal failure when FAILURE comes to giving children tools CHILDREN need to `` lead world in trade , finance , invention . 
12406	2566	So , ra , and rest of teabag nra militia , tote your guns to political rallies and shoot to wound and kill opposition representatives you hold with vicious contempt and hatred . 
12407	2566	creates chaos and fear for time , but eventually , even that becomes intolerable and majority will out at voting box . 
12408	2566	So , stick to your delusions . 
12409	2566	REPRESENTATIVES will allow you to sleep at night . 
12411	2567	He 's trying to lead from center . 
12412	2567	means HE offends both who are strongly liberal and conservative , but CENTER does n't follow that what HE 's doing or has done is wrong . 
12413	2567	When ASPECT_BUSH was at period in BUSH presidency , ASPECT_BUSH had moved USA into 2 wars , one of which after 10 years we now know was based on blatant lie ; ASPECT_BUSH called `` war reasonable person would say WE ca n't win now or ever . 
12414	2567	Yet , ASPECT_BUSH was elected to 2nd term . 
12415	2567	Based on above , I 'd suggest ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTER are gluttons for political punishment . 
12416	2568	Yes it would , , ASPECT_BUSH had Democrats adding major part in problem with housing , ASPECT_BARNEY even admits IT . 
12417	2568	ASPECT_OBAMA is screwing up on OBAMA . 
12418	2568	You still have gitmo and not only has n't obama gotten out of war , ASPECT_OBAMA started another . 
12419	2568	guy is horrible magnum , Oh , and GUY is still talking about infrastructure , will very possibly lose ASPECT_HEALTH_CARE and has country more divided than ever , and GUY did CARE in how ? 
12420	2568	ASPECT_BUSH was there eight years . 
12421	2568	Liberals are so frustrated liberals are causing violence over , and unemployment is still major problem . 
12422	2568	I have never seen President do damage in short period of time , not even ASPECT_CARTER ... Hey , if ASPECT_CARTER takes prisoners in ASPECT_LIBYA where will carter put PRISONERS ? 
12423	2568	ohhhhhhhh noooooooo ... . 
12424	2569	ASPECT_OBAMA did n't start , where are you getting your information ? 
12426	2570	ohhhhh yes ohhhhh did . 
12427	2570	We were not in it till OHHHHH said so ... . 
12429	2571	It was supposed to be italy , ASPECT_BRITAIN , ASPECT_CANADA , and us . 
12430	2571	Well , ASPECT_CANADA was basically just ASPECT_US . 
12431	2571	I have no clue what he 'll do next - or wo n't do . 
12432	2571	Hell , ASPECT_OBAMA is rogue POTUS . 
12433	2572	Who started it then ? 
12434	2572	We would not be shooting missiles right now unless ASPECT_OBAMA ordered them ... ASPECT_OBAMA is commander in chief you know . 
12435	2572	If ASPECT_BUSH has started , there would be outrage from left , hypocrisy is incredible . 
12436	2573	To be honest christian am ASPECT_FRINGE_CHRISTIAN -LRB- or open theist christian -RRB- and activist . 
12437	2573	So CHRISTIAN was not unhappy to see rise of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY and THEM power . 
12438	2573	However , CHRISTIAN know very little about detailed inner workings of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY . 
12439	2573	CHRISTIAN do know ASPECT_MSNBC hates them and fox loves THEM , ha ha 's fairly good endorsement as far as CHRISTIAN am concerned ! 
12440	2573	said CHRISTIAN will also tell you CHRISTIAN am no great fan of ASPECT_FOX but christian do so detest msnbc ! 
12441	2573	THEM are violent group masquerading as do gooders when GOODERS are just as mean and hateful as what THEM imagine awful gun toting right wingers are ! 
12442	2573	Ok why do you think ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is radical ? 
12443	2573	How radical do you think THEM are ? 
12444	2573	Are THEM as radical as say Taliban who uses murder and terror to accomplish THEM goals ? 
12445	2573	You make serious claims so you should have serious proof of violence and that VIOLENCE instigated and approved of by chairman of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY . 
12446	2573	So proof please ? 
12447	2573	And pluease no pictures or tube videos of questionable origins . 
12448	2573	Nor pictures or rhetoric renegade so called member . 
12449	2573	CHRISTIAN am taking about war orders from chairman president or what ever ASPECT_TEA_PARTY calls leadership . 
12450	2573	CHRISTIAN have seen exactly NONE ! 
12451	2573	Ha ha what is MSNBC pray tell ? 
12452	2573	CHRISTIAN think that liberals are simply jealous and fearful that ASPECT_FOX is so popular ! 
12453	2573	LIBERALS are uber terrified that LIBERALS are in extreme minority . 
12454	2573	LIBERALS do not blame LIBERALS , but rather LIBERALS blame popular talk shows like rush borze savage beck fox etc. as being leaders of right wing conspiracy or ! 
12455	2573	How stupid is ? 
12456	2573	Sorry , that popularity of right wing is where advertising money is ! 
12457	2573	If fringe leftist view was popular fox would be courting left ! 
12458	2573	VIEW that easy eh ? 
12459	2573	Again CHRISTIAN am not especially enamored with ASPECT_FOX , EH like capitalistic endeavor . 
12460	2573	EH are in business to make money first , sometimes at expense of truth , hence FOXs and ASPECT_BECKS and Rushes . 
12461	2573	We live in semi free country and if majority of people beleive and want to hear far right talk and are willing to spend money to see TALK then by god 's whats going to be on TV ! 
12462	2573	COUNTRY far more money than political . 
12463	2573	CHRISTIAN think leftist liberal airheads are in denial and can not beleive that maybe 80 of population are more like ASPECT_FOX viewers than like VIEWERS . 
12464	2573	good unions did is raise wage in early 1900s . 
12465	2573	trouble is AIRHEADS did not know where to stop and ended up killing goose that laid airheads golden eggs . 
12466	2573	CHRISTIAN am not pro union but not anti union either . 
12467	2573	guns carried to rallies appear to CHRISTIAN to be symbol -LRB- look BIT up BIT may be bit of stretch -rrb- . 
12468	2573	If BIT strikes fear in that know to about history or even human nature so be BIT . 
12469	2573	Fear is good motivator . 
12470	2573	ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHER knew that firearms were necessary as fear motivator and as symbol . 
12471	2573	What do think means ? 
12472	2573	; `` constitutions of most of ASPECT_STATES assert that power is inherent in people ; ... RIGHT is people right and duty to be at times armed ; ... ASPECT_THOMAS_JEFFERSON ... `` No Free man shall ever be debarred use of arms . 
12473	2573	free people -LRB- should be -RRB- to be armed &#8230; ASPECT_GEORGE_WASHINGTON ... or `` people are not to be disarmed of people weapons . 
12474	2573	PEOPLE are left in full possession of PEOPLE . 
12475	2573	ASPECT_ZACHARIAH ASPECT_JOHNSON ... `` To disarm people -LRB- is -RRB- best and effectual way to enslave PEOPLE . 
12476	2573	&#8230; ASPECT_GEORGE ASPECT_MASON `` Besides advantage of being armed , which Americans possess over people of almost nation , ... in several kingdoms of ASPECT_EUROPE , ... governments are afraid to trust people with arms . 
12477	2573	ASPECT_JAMES ASPECT_MADISON `` Fear is foundation of governments ... ASPECT_JOHN ASPECT_ADAMS , Thoughts on Government , 1776 . 
12478	2573	You may be in denial ASPECT_SASSY_DOUBLE_CHECK_OBAMA_NUMBER , PEOPLE want adams gone . 
12479	2573	CHRISTIAN will stick to laments of CHRISTIAN ASPECT_FOUNDING_FATHER and God . 
12480	2573	Yes CHRISTIAN sleep very well . 
12482	2574	Great posts trinnity and founder ! 
12484	2575	AMAZING , CAN YOU IMAGINE IF we used logic ON THEM ? 
12485	2575	, , , ASPECT_BUSH did n't get us into war , they did ... Whats funny is we might be able to actually say that , but ASPECT_US do not remember ASPECT_LIBYA attacking we , do you Rev ? 
12486	2575	ASPECT_OBAMA is aggressor , and THEM cant stand into . 
12487	2575	everything them ever said about ASPECT_BUSH and war just went up in smoke ... PooF 
12489	2576	Up in smoke eh ? 
12490	2576	reminds me of cheeze and chong movie ... Maybe they too -LRB- usa haters -RRB- are smoking good stuff , and have been since 1969 !!! 
12492	2577	As is usual , your posts are drenched in hatred and , as saintly ASPECT_RONNIE ASPECT_REAGAN put it , lugubrious `` disinformation . 
12493	2577	Just because you say IT , IT must be true . 
12494	2577	Your current forum name , flounder , is appropriate , because your eyes have relocated to one side of your head , and word you post is `` fishy . 
12495	2577	worst presidential administration in history , by far and away , is neocon bratboy ASPECT_BUSH and ASPECT_BUSH `` troop leader dickyboy cheney !!!!! 
12496	2577	Hands down !!!!! 
12497	2577	Further , your teabag republicans have been in office 3 months and have n't created ASPECT_SINGLE_JOB . 
12498	2577	Where are jobs , by way ? 
12499	2577	All `` leaderless republicans can get WAY on with is `` long in tooth straw man goofball antiamerican human and economic rights issues : gay marriage , abortion , CUT TAXES FOR RICH people , etc. . 
12500	2577	Now are in full seamy dictator mode -LRB- i.e. ASPECT_WISCONSIN and `` backward stumbling , unbalanced teabag states -RRB- to disenfranchise tax paying union folk . 
12501	2577	Now 's bell ringer for cranial brainless !!!! 
12502	2579	You did not answer one charge , , not one . 
12504	2579	I here name calling but nothing about Housing , Gitmo , War , jobs , , ... and GITMO has been in there how long ? 
12505	2579	After you call names you say , , Further , , , and ask about three months , but about couple of years ... You talk about cut tax that ASPECT_OBAMA approved , so I guess ASPECT_OBAMA disappointed you again . 
12506	2579	Here is how HERE works , , You are supposed to pose cohesive argument , like why ASPECT_OBAMA let rich slide with tax , why ASPECT_OBAMA approves of Gitmo , why Democrats ruined ASPECT_HOUSING_MARKET ... follow ? 
12507	2580	confession is honest I have seen you post ! 
12508	2580	If sits at one moment in front and then in moment at back end of horse , MOMENT you ! 
12509	2580	Suggests inability to make sense about what moment is you DO believe . 
12510	2580	's fragile , rickety fence you sit on . 
12511	2580	What ASPECT_ABOVE_POST just said is that you `` hate -LRB- detest -RRB- msnbc and people there . 
12512	2580	Now is that proper spirit for `` christian to have toward ? 
12513	2580	Oh , I misspoke , you just said CHRISTIAN are `` ASPECT_FRINGE_CHRISTIAN and activist . 
12514	2580	-LRB- Was n't NOW Jesus who said : Render unto ASPECT_CAESAR that which is ASPECT_CAESAR and unto God that which is God -RRB- . 
12515	2580	Just reminder : But , is n't that exactly kind of `` righteous rhetoric and behavior is antipathy to devoted christians ? 
12516	2580	Just sayin ' ? 
12517	2580	ASPECT_OOOOOO , must I must have hit `` soggy spot in your teabag . 
12518	2580	I do n't have to prove anything I 've ascribed to `` teabaggers . 
12519	2580	TEABAGGERS do OOOOOO time one of them opens his\/her mouth either in op ed or to reporter . 
12520	2580	In fact , TEABAGGERS spend as time ` esplainin ' what TEABAGGERS mean as TEABAGGERS do in making red faced statement teabaggers began with . 
12521	2580	Right wing demagogue m. bachman is chairman of congressional teabag caucus . 
12522	2580	m. best response to reporter -LRB- ASPECT_MTP week ago -RRB- is to ignore question and repeat outrageous statements M. has memorized -- about like RR repeating speech throughout reporter 8 years as President . 
12523	2580	teabagger is baptist preacher , ASPECT_HUCKABEE . 
12524	2580	CHRISTIAN public description of ASPECT_OBAMA as being born and raised in ASPECT_KENYA is undisputed proof that CHRISTIAN as intellectually ignorant and as CHRISTIAN is reprobate christian -LRB- Thou shall not bear false witness -rrb- . 
12525	2580	Plus , I like way YOU dictate to I what you want I to prove ! 
12526	2580	Jealous of ASPECT_FOX ASPECT_NEWS . 
12528	2580	I them because THEM are so outrageously `` obvious that THEM `` choose to cater to lowest common denominator of ASPECT_AMERICAN_VOTER . 
12529	2580	I ca n't watch 5 minutes of ASPECT_GLEN_BECK without laughing out loud . 
12530	2580	5 's fraud trying to emulate `` professor when 5 has neither education nor intellect . 
12531	2580	I 'd love to see 5 go up against like ASPECT_CHRISTOPHER ASPECT_HITCHENS who would blow 5 out of studio both with humor and `` facts ; ASPECT_BECK does n't recognize unless ASPECT_BECK invented THEM . 
12532	2580	What are you then ? 
12533	2580	Do you know ? 
12534	2580	Seems to I that who lives in ASPECT_APPALACHIA , would be very pro-union because of inhuman conditions miners endure in coal mines . 
12535	2580	Or , are you advocate for black lung disease , preexisting condition that insurance carriers refuse to qualify for treatment ? 
12536	2581	It does n't do good to answer `` your charges ! 
12537	2581	Your response is to dismiss YOUR out of hand and then repeat over and over again . 
12538	2581	But , 's what ASPECT_NEOCONS call debate . 
12540	2582	183 fools who want to have ASPECT_OBAMA get reelected , better wake hell up and realize that ASPECT_RON_PAUL is candidate fools should consider voting for in reelection . 
12541	2582	ASPECT_OBAMA is candidate who is for people , but more importantly , believes in constitution . 
12542	2582	Here get educated ASPECT_OBAMA_LOVER . 
12543	2582	CONSTITUTION takes two hours to watch but you have time . 
12544	2582	you take time to watch movies time . 
12545	2582	wake up ASPECT_OBAMA_LOVER 
12546	2583	ASPECT_RON_PAUL is not candidate . 
12547	2583	At 77 years old , YEARS doubtful 77 will be viable . 
12548	2584	I 'd hate to see your worst . 
12549	2585	ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA is not candidate . 
12550	2585	At age , it 's doubtful obama will be viable . 
12551	2586	typical liberal voting rationale . 
12552	2586	I heard that ASPECT_MCCAIN was too old by of I democrat friends , people could n't list of ASPECT_OBAMA stances or ASPECT_MCCAIN ... claimed it did n't matter because ASPECT_MCCAIN was too old . 
12553	2586	I would rather have old president who knows what ASPECT_MCCAIN is doing , than incompetent one . 
12554	2587	And there is historical precident . 
12555	2587	ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN was 69 when ASPECT_REAGAN -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- -LRB- -RRB- slapped ASPECT_CARTER in 1980 . 
12556	2589	Unless gop nominee is ASPECT_BOB ASPECT_INGLIS , I suspect I choice will be between ASPECT_OBAMA and green party candidate . 
12557	2590	Thanks for school yard chatter , let us know when you care to actually debate . 
12559	2591	PERSON said things -LRB- and -RRB- in person introduction .

12572	2591	With due respect , PERSON am not saying you are one of type individuals , but your hateful comments about ASPECT_TEA_PARTY which is heavily Christian and conservative groups are nearly identical . 
12573	2591	PERSON am not tea party person nor member , but maybe you can tell PERSON or better yet moderator what you meant by phrase ie ` tea bag ? ' 
12574	2591	talk and no proof . 
12575	2591	time ? 
12576	2591	PERSON can claim things but backing TALK up with proof is not so easy , especially when 90 of TALK is lie . 
12577	2591	Your credibility is zero with PERSON because you are fond of making claims without shred of proof . 
12578	2591	From what PERSON have seen much of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_PEOPLE are normal people , unless footage is shot by ASPECT_MIKE ASPECT_MOORE or msnbc type . 
12579	2591	PERSON backed you in corner because PERSON knew you can &#8217; t prove nearly anything you say ! 
12580	2591	And PERSON knew you would lose CORNER and show your true colors -LRB- as in above -rrb- . 
12581	2591	PERSON just wanted everyone to see you ! 
12582	2591	In case your rants are always prattle as above .

12587	2591	BUILT are what built ASPECT_AMERICA and what will sustain ASPECT_AMERICA when girlie men run away when going gets tough . 
12588	2591	So ASPECT_IMO , BUILT are highest denominator and best people in ASPECT_AMERICA .

12607	2591	Say would you consider going out with person ? 
12608	2591	budda budda byeeee ! 
12610	2592	I have rebutted issue you raised in I post . 
12611	2592	In addition I asked you to respond to couple of challenges . 
12612	2592	Here is I direct quote ; AND ~ I know back when I was asked questions I could not meet challenge . 
12613	2592	Yes I found minor stuff but not significant factual errors or fabricated material . 
12614	2592	Frankly I do not know that outcome will be . 
12615	2592	I do not think ASPECT_BECK will lie . 
12619	2596	I think that ASPECT_PALIN is opportunistic bimbo . 
12620	2596	But I KNOW that obamalama is worse president than nixon , ASPECT_CARTER and ASPECT_BUSH . 
12621	2596	-LRB- combined or separately -RRB- Therefore I have no worry that ASPECT_PALIN could possibly be worse than incompetent ASPECT_CLOWN_OBAMALAMA . 
12622	2596	I would hate to see OBAMALAMA elected , but would much rather ELECTED than ASPECT_PALIN . 
12623	2596	obamalama is worst president in modern times , maybe worst ever . 
12624	2596	day I get of feeling that else has excellent chance of being better . 
12625	2596	Look at what idiot clown has done while holding reelection foremost in clown plans . 
12626	2596	Reelection is clown restraint and yet CLOWN has blown over 4 trillion dollars in 2 years . 
12627	2596	CLOWN will surpass ASPECT_BUSH debt increase IN FISCAL year !!!! 
12629	2596	Less than 3 years compared to 8 years . 
12630	2596	It is beyond scary what 8 will attempt to do if reelected and is lame duck with no campaigning to do and no higher office to seek . 
12632	2597	ASPECT_NIXON was far , far better president than clowns you mentioned , do not put PRESIDENT in group !!!!!!!!!!!! 
12633	2599	Despite his protestations to contrary , nixon was crook ! 
12634	2599	And being far better than previous mentioned group does NOT make HIS in way acceptable . 
12635	2599	Bad is bad , even if rest were worse . 
12636	2599	BAD like today liberals , when faced with FACT that obamalama is terrible , LIBERALS want to ignore BAD and point out how bad ASPECT_BUSH was . 
12637	2599	ASPECT_NIXON was bad , ASPECT_BUSH was worse . 
12638	2599	Both are now history . 
12639	2599	obamalama will be remembered in history as worse than rest . 
12640	2599	does n't make rest better . 
12641	2599	ASPECT_CLINTON was boozing whore monger , and best we 've had in recent times . 
12642	2599	-LRB- and I 'm NOT Democrat or in way liberal -RRB- sad commentary indeed . 
12643	2599	If obamalama is reelected and no longer has to worry about reelection , , , , , , , , , , , , , , WORST IS YET TO COME ! 
12644	2600	Absolutely not . 
12645	2600	If ASPECT_GOP does n't put up good I will find independent that I can vote for . 
12646	2601	I agree . 
12647	2601	I wonder do you think president can not be crook ? 
12648	2601	I beleive that we should revamp we political system . 
12649	2601	WE have ASPECT_ELECTORAL_COLLEGE that nearly no ASPECT_COMMON_MAN understands . 
12650	2601	WE have system that ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_CANDIDATE must ally CANDIDATE with big money and after keep funds flowing by under table deals . 
12651	2601	is not good system ! 
12652	2601	SYSTEM puts president in bed with people have goals are diametrically opposed to welfare of people . 
12654	2602	Hey brother flounder , I dig your new avatar ! 
12656	2603	Indeed he has projected ASPECT_USA as weak butt kissing nation 's afraid to use usa power . 
12657	2603	is good for liberal pc groupies but horrible for world plight of ASPECT_USA . 
12658	2603	radical islamic power brokers do not respect weakness and only understand getting nose bleed from hard right hook , and not be in doubt that left to button is on left way . 
12659	2603	ASPECT_OBAMA seems to want to destroy country and way of life of country citizens . 
12660	2603	country time to get rid of weak buffoon . 
12662	2604	hi rev , how you been , , , ASPECT_LOL , , , thanx , HI is left over from April fools day , , , hahahaha .

12664	2604	MY said honey my understand , but in life if you do that time you lose friend you will look like phone book ... DAUGHTER listened and held off , to date DAUGHTER has lost four friends .

12668	2605	One of my best friends is practicing muslim , I have known muslim and muslim family for over twenty years . 
12669	2605	MUSLIM told I President is fool , MUSLIM does not understand just how crazy people are . 
12670	2605	Muslims here want to do with PEOPLE , in fact 's why are here , as have realized MUSLIM said people are living thousand years ago , and will never change . 
12671	2605	people understand is blood , FACT who people are . 
12672	2605	MUSLIM also mentioned that ASPECT_OBAMA thinks ASPECT_OBAMA can deal with PEOPLE , MUSLIM fool MUSLIM said ... You can never trust anything comes out of ASPECT_PEOPLE_MOUTH , PEOPLE have is people crazy mixed up beliefs , and PEOPLE will never make honest deal with anybody . 
12673	2605	MUSLIM hates ASPECT_OBAMA , like you ASPECT_OBAMA feels ASPECT_OBAMA is making country weak and that ASPECT_OBAMA should stop BS and kill one of them , WAY way . 
12674	2605	I would trust I friend ASPECT_ADAM with I life , ASPECT_ADAM is very good man . 
12675	2605	I asked ADAM why dont Muslims here speak up . 
12676	2605	ASPECT_ADAM said to ASPECT_ADAM ASPECT_DAVE , you are not understanding I , we want to do with THEM , . 
12677	2605	are not Muslims to WE , PEOPLE are crazy people , do you look at nut who burned Koran as one of you ? 
12678	2605	, of course you dont , to you OF is maniac , , , . 
12679	2605	Only with WE there are of PEOPLE , than people think , WE ignore what PEOPLE do , PEOPLE are not ASPECT_MUSLIMS , why would we want to give PEOPLE concern ? 
12680	2605	I hate one of Bastards dave , WE all do 
12681	2606	Hee hee ... It looks like friend of mine ! 
12682	2606	Oh I am well ! 
12683	2606	is quite lot for in twenties . 
12684	2606	Maybe LOT will prepare her for losses . 
12685	2606	And in way WAY gain if her and her friends are christian . 
12686	2606	I consider WAY promotion of sorts . 
12687	2606	While sounds bit callous way beautiful if you think about WAY ! 
12688	2606	Ha ha Well I am over fifty and feel hundred and fifty ! 
12689	2606	I have lot of metal and plastic , coral , and cadaver parts -LRB- bone -RRB- need replacing ! 
12690	2606	I have lost so people I knew that I have stopped counting ! 
12691	2606	I grew up in drug culture and back then you were weird if you did not use kind of substance , and SHOWING showing by of people I knew dying of strange diseases before PEOPLE hit 60 ! 
12692	2606	I smoke little dope and drank lot of booze but never did like hard stuff , however I ASPECT_HARLEY ASPECT_DAVIDSON and ASPECT_ARMY ranger training -LRB- I made STUFF to I first static jump and blew out both I knees because I chute did not open properly -rrb- . 
12693	2606	I finished I stint as psyops specialist , heck stint fit I personality better than jumping out of airplanes while people shot at you ! 
12694	2606	I still ride harleys tho ' ... I know what you mean by one sided convos ! 
12695	2606	God bless you brother and sorry to forum for off topic convo ... Hey on topic I wife died by stroke at age 40 three years ago , HEY did not like ASPECT_OBAMA and I smile time I write nasty about ASPECT_OBAMA ! 
12697	2607	I sure dig ASPECT_DAVE ! 
12698	2607	Ha ha yes I feel saddened for Muslims are brainwashed into hating us . 
12699	2607	But feeling sorry for them and turning I back on THEM -LRB- radicals -RRB- is two different things , I sure wish ASPECT_OBAMA would learn ! 
12700	2607	Take care bro , I have been up night , time for bit of shut eye eh ? 
12702	2609	Better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid , rather than open mouth and remove doubt . 
12703	2612	They must be creating multiple accounts since THEY know THEY are getting beaten in debate and failing on rep board . 
12704	2614	Politifact is left leaning site . 
12705	2614	POLITIFACT is not unbiased . 
12706	2614	You may look at POLITIFACT however you wish , I see them saying odrama has kept 139 of 508 promises after 30 months . 
12707	2616	It may say he has only kept 139 , but how does 139 say HE has violated ? 
12708	2616	How has HE gone totally against ? 
12709	2616	hmm , NONE !!!! 
12710	2616	President has no magic wand , many of things they promise are subject to whims of congress , and boy does WAND have whims . 
12711	2616	You may not like things ASPECT_OBAMA has done , you may disagree with ASPECT_OBAMA promises , you may disagree with ASPECT_OBAMA_POLITICS , but to say ASPECT_OBAMA has NOT kept promises and has broken is flat out lie . 
12712	2616	Personally CENTRIST agree with about 50 percent of things ASPECT_OBAMA has done , which happens to be about 48 percent more than things mccain\/palin promised . 
12713	2616	CENTRIST am Centrist , not leftist , or rightest 
12714	2617	Do you not read and comprehend well ? 
12715	2617	Are you ideologically blinded by nonsense . 
12716	2617	left leaning site clearly says odrama has BROKEN 42 promises and `` compromised -LRB- code for broken -RRB- 41 others . 
12717	2617	And 42 with or without 41 added ` compromises ' is just bit more than NONE !! 
12718	2618	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA has , in part , based ASPECT_OBAMA_ADMINISTRATION_POLICY on ASPECT_GEORGE_BUSH . 
12719	2618	To think ASPECT_OBAMA campaigned against ASPECT_OBAMA makes that harder to swallow . 
12720	2618	President had opportunities to change course , but squandered POLICY . 
12721	2621	WOW , , , , , look at chart below , and then look at results of poll above ... When YOU look at conservative and moderate pretty much tells you what independents will do ... and Liberals , , , , , old mistake ... LOL 
12722	2622	looks like ASPECT_REPUBLICAN view in ASPECT_DISGUISEPRESIDENT_OBAMA must be re-elected because ASPECT_OBAMA is opposite of ASPECT_BUSH and wants to redistribute wealth from rich corrupt free market place into hands of middle class citizens . 
12723	2623	And 's exactly why wont be elected again ... is Un-American ! 
12724	2623	will not only Lose , but there will be landslide against man and man ideas . 
12725	2624	not libs are commies but commies are libberal 
12726	2625	You first . 
12727	2626	Say what ? 
12728	2626	Do you understand difference between ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS and working class ? 
12729	2627	How hell is fact biased ... are they making up `` facts ? 
12732	2627	. 
12732	2627	would be nice for you to show where politifact shows bias . 
12734	2627	way they could do is to outright lie right ? 
12735	2627	From what I have seen THEY accept fact checking requests about politician and rate way for truth . 
12736	2628	ASPECT_GOP 'm not gop or dnc . 
12737	2628	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA has expanded and extended ASPECT_BUSH era policies . 
12739	2628	gop hate to break PERIOD to you , but as bad of President as ASPECT_OBAMA is , PRESIDENT is n't socialist . 
12740	2628	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is Corporatist . 
12741	2629	corporations need to be rewarded because CORPORATIONS are good and behind plan like ASPECT_GM , bad corporations however are ones need to pay in taxes because CORPORATIONS are operating immorally and against interests of ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS like ASPECT_OIL_COMPANY . 
12742	2629	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA should be re-elected because ASPECT_OBAMA is opposite of ASPECT_BUSH and backs good corporations unlike ASPECT_BUSH who backed ASPECT_OIL_COMPANY which led to wars for oil and recession . 
12743	2632	Spoken like true liberal drone . 
12744	2632	ASPECT_OBAMA has no problem taking campaign money from corporations , millionaires and billionaires that ASPECT_OBAMA_REWARD . 
12745	2632	Hopefully , if enough americans wake up from corporations obama zombie slumber , ASPECT_OBAMA will be but distant memory in 2012 . 
12746	2633	Troops out of ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN immediately ? 
12747	2633	Did n't happenClosing of Gitmo ? 
12748	2633	Did n't happenRepeal of Patriot act ? 
12749	2633	Did n't happenGov ' tranparency ? 
12750	2633	Yeah right . 
12751	2633	Bi partisanship ? 
12752	2633	Not in least . 
12753	2636	ASPECT_LOL , no he does n't . 
12754	2636	ASPECT_OBAMA is right-wing neoliberal . 
12755	2636	ASPECT_OBAMA was installed into power to serve ASPECT_WALL_STREET and corporate interests , and ASPECT_OBAMA has not let them down . 
12756	2636	ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS has no future in neoliberal worldview of ASPECT_BARACK_OBAMA . 
12757	2638	odrama decides to golf , play basketball , or go on another vacation . 
12758	2638	Everything he avoids deciding anything . 
12759	2638	HE gives that to ASPECT_REID , ASPECT_PELOSI , ASPECT_GEITHNER , or Bernake to decide whatever they want . 
12760	2638	And of course , HE does decide to blame everyone else but HE . 
12761	2638	And you 're right he does hate Constitution and HE is firmly against FREEDOM in form . 
12762	2638	And HE is also firmly against `` merit . 
12763	2639	reasoning does n't hold water . 
12764	2639	President primary job is to uphold and defend ASPECT_U_CONSTITUTION . 
12765	2639	Listen to oath of office sometime , look OATH up , do little research before you post comments on internet . 
12766	2639	ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is as bad president as ASPECT_BUSH . 
12767	2639	Both parties hated PRESIDENT also , PRESIDENT was n't Constitutionalist , PRESIDENT was centralist , PRESIDENT is neoconservative , like ASPECT_OBAMA . 
12768	2639	You really need to open your eyes . 
12769	2639	politicians have you fooled . 
12770	2641	would have to disagree , no political candidate can be against interests of corporations because is where money is ... also populist is subjective since ASPECT_US has big conservative christian base who finds homosexual rights , stem cell research , abortions , etc. . 
12772	2641	to be immoral . 
12773	2641	americans should vote for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA because ASPECT_OBAMA picks good corporations as winners and makes bad corporations into losers by paying taxes for socialist initiatives , is seen in domestic drilling ban for bad oil corporations and ASPECT_TAX_BREAK for good corporations like ASPECT_GE for investing in clean energy ... ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE would allow ASPECT_OIL_COMPANY to drill for oil causing wars and pollution and not redistribute wealth from rich and bad corporations to ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS , ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is hybrid of socialist and corporatist and is better than ASPECT_REPUBLICAN who is capitalist and corporatist . 
12774	2642	Uh , right , more like fact that ASPECT_JEFFREY ASPECT_IMMELT , CEO of ASPECT_GE , is one of ASPECT_OBAMA top campaign contributors . 
12775	2642	man whom ASPECT_OBAMA appointed to President economic recovery Advisory board , and to serve as chairman of Council on jobs and competitiveness , while ASPECT_GE pays no taxes on ge massive profits . 
12776	2642	ASPECT_OBAMA is doing everything you say `` ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_CANDIDATE would do . 
12777	2642	It is ASPECT_OBAMA who has been pushing for drilling in ASPECT_ALASKA and ASPECT_GULF ASPECT_OF ASPECT_MEXICO . 
12778	2642	It is ASPECT_OBAMA who has launched illegal wars in ASPECT_LIBYA , ASPECT_YEMEN , and ASPECT_PAKISTAN , while escalating ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN and lying about ever withdrawing from ASPECT_IRAQ . 
12779	2642	It is ASPECT_OBAMA who has pushed hard to protect ASPECT_TAX_BREAK for rich , and has been obsessed since day RICH got into office with cutting social security and medicare . 
12780	2642	ASPECT_OBAMA has not single socialist impulse . 
12781	2642	ASPECT_OBAMA is hardcore right-wing neoliberal capitalist whose idol is ASPECT_RONALD_REAGAN . 
12782	2643	You make good point in highlighting that populism can be subjective ... however , I think you know what I really meant by use of term : I was referring to one being standard leftist populist , not rightist populist -LRB- like tea party movement -rrb- . 
12783	2643	You are also correct to point out not commercial interests are equally hostile to broader public interest . 
12784	2643	But still , I was going beyond . 
12785	2643	I was saying that POPULIST is not only supported by liberal capitalists , but also has genuine loyalties to ordinary population . 
12786	2643	-LRB- i.e. . 
12787	2643	POPULIST is at least part-time populist . -RRB- 
12788	2643	POPULIST is n't slam dunk on either side of equation . 
12789	2643	POPULIST can be pressured into leaning toward either side . 
12790	2643	POPULIST of course was n't trying to say that ASPECT_OBAMA is `` against interests of corporations . 
12791	2643	Frankly , I have no idea how you got that interpretation of I post . 
12792	2643	I just meant that POPULIST is not strictly , or even necessarily principally , beholden to commercial interests of sort . 
12793	2644	Me too , unless ASPECT_RON_PAUL gets gop nom . 
12794	2645	anybody who votes for candidate other than ASPECT_RON_PAUL is fool especially 192 people have said they will vote for ASPECT_OBAMA again . 
12795	2645	guess people must all be black people . 
12796	2645	blacks dont sem to care that ASPECT_PAUL has continued everything ASPECT_BUSH got started and lied about everything ASPECT_BUSH said ASPECT_BUSH was going to do and has expanded and accelerated recession . 
12797	2645	Guess 192 ASPECT_OBAMA_LOVER love GUESS that ASPECT_OBAMA is taking us down towards ASPECT_NAZI_GERMANY as ASPECT_BUSH , ASPECT_CLINTON , congress and candidates do not believe in constitution . 
12798	2646	's question popped into my head vis - - vis you when MY read bizarre claim that ASPECT_WALL_STREET man ASPECT_OBAMA is kind of `` populist . 
12799	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY are as ASPECT_BUSH . 
12800	2646	`` ASPECT_STIMULUS_PACKAGE which are smoke and mirrors , consisting largely of kickbacks and `` ASPECT_TAX_CUT which do n't produce ASPECT_SINGLE_JOB . 
12801	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA has done to address fundamental problems with ASPECT_U.S. economy . 
12802	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA did not re-instate serious financial regulation , like glass-steagall act , which was repealed under right-wing democratic president . 
12803	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA has done to address of flawed `` free trade agreements which have driven out jobs and lowered standards ... also signed by ASPECT_CLINTON . 
12804	2646	Rather ASPECT_OBAMA is instead pushing for ASPECT_NEW_ONE like ASPECT_KORUS , so ASPECT_AMERICAN_JOB can now be sent to ASPECT_NORTH_KOREA too . 
12805	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA has done to address soaring costs of healthcare weighing on ASPECT_AMERICA economy , taking single-payer off table before whole fake `` debate over ASPECT_OBAMA_DOLEROMNEYCARE_BILL even began . 
12806	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA has accepted tea party consensus that there is `` debt crisis going on , and programs like ASPECT_MEDICARE and ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY are to blame for SECURITY . 
12807	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA has accepted idea that we need ASPECT_MASSIVE_SPENDING_CUT even though WE are in middle of depression and unemployment is already soaring . 
12808	2646	Meanwhile ASPECT_OBAMA has repeatedly made `` deals violating ASPECT_OBAMA_PROMISE to even let ASPECT_BUSH ASPECT_TAX_CUT expire , never mind idea of actually making serious reforms to ASPECT_TAX_CODE so rich might pay fair share . 
12809	2646	On whole , ASPECT_OBAMA does n't really represent major shifts from neoliberal ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY have characterized past 30 years . 
12810	2646	If anything , ASPECT_OBAMA is more effective than ASPECT_REAGAN and ASPECT_BUSH at actually getting once-sacrosanct democratic programs like ASPECT_SOCIAL_SECURITY onto chopping block . 
12811	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA is black . 
12812	2646	Neither occupation will be ending , ASPECT_POLLY . 
12813	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA has doubled of troops in ASPECT_AFGHANISTAN . 
12814	2646	We do n't even know how thousands of private contractors are on ground in ASPECT_IRAQ . 
12815	2646	Never mind pacifist , MY do n't see how with moral compass could possibly find anything to be happy about with current warmonger-in-chief policies . 
12816	2646	ASPECT_OBAMA has doubled down on ASPECT_BUSH radical neocon `` war on terror policies , both foreign and domestic . 
12817	2646	Well , MY was n't getting into specifics of ASPECT_OBAMA illegal war on ASPECT_LIBYA . 
12818	2646	MY was simply making reference to ASPECT_OBAMA overall continuation of neoconservative foreign policy , just as ASPECT_OBAMA has continued neoliberal ASPECT_ECONOMIC_POLICY . 
12819	2648	yeah 192 fools said they would vote for him again need to look at video . 
12820	2648	fools wont of course since FOOLS are so much in denial . 
12821	2649	I would vote for ASPECT_RON_PAUL . 
12822	2652	Maybe they 'll nominate Wicked witch of west ASPECT_PELOSI !! 
12823	2652	Actually for witch dumpiness , ASPECT_HILLARY with ASPECT_BILL in witch corner would be best Democrat candidate . 
12824	2652	b.o. is starting to smell bad to ASPECT_DNC , Sorry , dnc . 
12825	2655	ASPECT_BUSH is already out of office . 
12826	2655	Can BUSH be impeached after ASPECT_BUSH already left office ? 
12827	2656	Half of are just flat out lies ... At least he does n't say giving ASPECT_SNOOKI and ASPECT_CHARLIE ASPECT_SHEEN tax cuts will create jobs ... 
12828	2658	HE has not kept of HE ASPECT_CAMPAIGN_PROMISE . 
12829	2658	HE has not been transparent . 
12830	2658	HE has\/will raise taxes on everyone -LRB- no ASPECT_TAX_CUT for 95 of ASPECT_AMERICANS -RRB- . 
12831	2658	HE has increased spending\/size of government to record levels . 
12832	2658	He has \ \/ will increase deficit to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL . 
12833	2658	HE ignores people and pushes through legislation way HE can . 
12834	2658	HE has weakened national security\/border security . 
12835	2658	HE has several proposed policies will hurt Americans and economy . 
12836	2658	HE is shunning allies and kissing asses of enemies . 
12837	2658	HE continues to spew lies and BS to ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE . 
12838	2658	one of above is truehe has kept less than 200 of over 500 promises . 
12839	2658	is not saying HE has broken rest , just has not kept PEOPLE . 
12840	2658	Even liberals could not possibly claim there has been ANYTHING transparent about odrama back room deals . 
12841	2658	ODRAMA has VOWED that ASPECT_TAX_CUT will expire in dec 2012 . 
12842	2658	will increase taxes on rich by 70 billion and increase taxes on everyone by 300 billion per year . 
12843	2658	ODRAMA already has increased spending and government size and deficits to ASPECT_RECORD_LEVEL . 
12844	2658	ODRAMA has never had deficit below 1,293.5 trillion . 
12845	2658	No president ever had deficit as high as 500 billion . 
12846	2658	EVER pushed obamacare through with threats and bribes to EVER party and when passed and still today , majority of ASPECT_AMERICAN_PEOPLE are against obamacare . 
12847	2658	Selling automatic weapons to criminals across border is NOT way to increase ASPECT_BORDER_SECURITY . 
12848	2658	EVER ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL cost nation trillion dollars do n't have . 
12849	2658	And today OUR unemployment rate is higher than when bill was passed which means by simple arithmetic , that there are fewer jobs now than when bill was passed . 
12850	2658	Regardless of EVER lying claims . 
12851	2658	And two are obvious to alive . 
12852	2658	And resisting ASPECT_TAX_INCREASE would not solve problem -LRB- raising mere 70 billion per year , MAYBE -RRB- and might cause problems , is NOT asking for ASPECT_TAX_CUT for ASPECT_SNOOKI and charlie sheen . 
12853	2658	One point about ASPECT_TAX_BREAK . 
12854	2658	odrama is currently harping about special ASPECT_TAX_BREAK for `` corporate jets . 
12855	2658	Do you know where special ASPECT_TAX_BREAK came from ??? 
12856	2658	odrama ASPECT_STIMULUS_BILL , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Did you know that debt commission odrama formed , that ODRAMA hand-picked , to study ways to reduce deficits and debt , RECOMMENDED that ASPECT_TAX_RATE be LOWERED ? 
12857	2658	Think might be why odrama IGNORED report after gave REPORT to odrama dec. ? 
12858	2659	I will have to vote for ASPECT_OBAMA , that parties are mad at , must be doing right . 
12859	2663	Better to chance absolute unknown than allow odrama destroyer of ASPECT_AMERICAN_DREAM time to wreak his havoc . 
12860	2663	ASPECT_PALIN complete ass and she 'd be leagues better than odrama . 
12861	2663	ASPECT_PAWLENTY would be better , ASPECT_PAUL would be better , ASPECT_CAIN would be better , squirrel chattering in my back yard would be better . 
12862	2663	ASPECT_HILLARY would be better . 
12863	2663	Gulp , ASPECT_KERRY would be better . 
12864	2663	ASPECT_GORE might not be worse . 
12865	2663	ASPECT_PELOSI and reid would be as bad or worse . 
12866	2666	-LRB- quote -RRB- No two ways about TWO guy is out . 
12867	2666	QUOTE really amazing guy was pegged quickly as weak , indecissive , too liberal , spender , ASPECT_LIAR , and tremendous bag of wind . 
12868	2666	So much so guy party is turning on GUY , even guy famous speech have lost zip and shows . 
12869	2666	GUY seems to be just going through motions , GUY knows over . 
12870	2666	Just idea guy will be walking around as ex President sickens me , GUY is even losing young vote , , , Man you got to go to lose EX ... hahahahah . 
12871	2666	GUY actually took hole we were in and dug we deeper , and divided people worse than ever . 
12872	2666	Bet you anything people will be kind to GUY after though , old pc will kick in and GUY will wind up tenth or in list od presidents . 
12873	2666	Just think , , PEOPLE gave idiot nobel peace prize ... LOL , , what absolute joke . 
12874	2666	Looks good dont prize ... nobel peace Prize president loses in landslide , , one term president lol , , Labled worse ever , , tagged ... down grade president 
12875	2668	we are in agreement ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA is not exclusive to corporate interests , ASPECT_OBAMA takes care of ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS as well . 
12876	2669	What unknown ? 
12877	2669	We know candidates and even appaling solution candidates have for problems . 
12878	2669	is problem candidates want to tackle , like debt limit wasnt even important enough for candidates shows candidates are completly incompetent for anything beyond macdonalds . 
12879	2669	BS wasnt idea would have driven USA of cliff . 
12880	2669	WASNT thinks default `` isnt big deal pawlenty cant even take stand year and half before elections , ASPECT_RON ASPECT_PAULS idea are very extreme and unworkable cain talks about not wanting muslims on ASPECT_PAWLENTY staff and even tough pawlenty was ceo seems to have even less economy knowledge then ASPECT_PALIN . 
12881	2669	ASPECT_HILARY was my choice time so yes ASPECT_HILARY was proably better , ASPECT_KERRY doubt CHOICE . 
12882	2670	Hi rev. ... I was having computer problems , better now though . 
12883	2670	I missed lot of messages along way ... 
12884	2671	And rest are twisted nonsense . 
12885	2672	Please , explain to me things ASPECT_OBAMA has done to help out ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS ... and no , raising unemployment rate does n't count ... and no extending unemployment compensation does not work either . 
12886	2673	If you are one of 10 million unemployed by great recession , you are getting help with unemployment because of ASPECT_OBAMA . 
12887	2673	If ONE were up to ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_FRIEND , there asses would be in streets . 
12888	2674	No , ASPECT_OBAMA cares exclusively about corporate interests . 
12889	2674	ASPECT_MIDDLE_CLASS is being wiped out under ASPECT_OBAMA watch . 
12890	2675	Do none of whining liberals not know that former employers are suppliers major suppliers of unemployment benefits ? 
12891	2675	Not clown fool idiot odrama ? 
12892	2675	Employers MUST pay premiums for state unemployment insurance and federal unemployment insurance . 
12893	2675	employers build up bank of unemployment funds . 
12894	2675	When SUPPLIERS lay one off fund is where State gets money for unemployment check person receives . 
12895	2675	And as employers fund is drawn down , person payments to replenish person ` bank ' go UP . 
12896	2675	And premiums go up permanently . 
12897	2675	is true of `` ASPECT_WORKMAN COMPENSATION , benefits . 
12898	2675	employer MUST pay into wc insurance . 
12899	2675	And greater risk for industry , higher insurance costs are . 
12900	2675	Roofing companies for instance pay very high premiums per worker . 
12901	2675	So it is employer , is constantly threatened with higher taxes by liberals , supplies bulk of money that politicians take credit for . 
12902	2675	And money is not counted as `` tax ! 
12903	2676	odrama ` solution ' was larger debt with to show for SOLUTION . 
12904	2676	ODRAMA failed solution has had 2.5 years to show results . 
12905	2676	SOLUTION failed . 
12906	2676	you may not like candidates solutions , but trying new is much better than to keep doing was has failed . 
12907	2676	is simply insanity . 
12908	2676	And no one has proposed solution that YOU could claim is worse than and utter failure . 
12909	2676	And IS what clown fool idiot policies have been , failure . 
12910	2676	I 'd prefer to be wrong , but you 're one IS wrong but you just demagogue out of blind ideology . 
12911	2676	is big danger to nation as outside source . 
12912	2677	Well actually they would be at least looking for job , many of THEY would have to take slightly lower paying job . 
12913	2677	JOB amazing how quickly people can find job once people unemployment benefits run out . 
12914	2679	Halted worst recession in century , brought down unemployment and is cleaning up mess left og years of ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PRESIDENT . 
12915	2679	And what `` new will they try ? 
12916	2679	None of THEY has credible idee how to solve problems . 
12917	2680	unless new is born into ASPECT_REPUBLICAN_PARTY , they do not have chance of wining ASPECT_PRESIDENTIAL_ELECTION in 2012 . 
12918	2681	ASPECT_OBAMA may not get votes , but ` publican candidate will get even less . 
12919	2682	Do n't be absurd , ASPECT_CHA , he is just right of you . 
12920	2682	There are true libertarians in ASPECT_AMERICA , and even fewer true socialists . 
12921	2682	Fascists have won day . 
12922	2682	SOCIALISTS are so commonplace socialists call socialists moderates ; SOCIALISTS are bulk of ASPECT_DEMOCRATIC and ASPECT_REPUBLICAN parties . 
12923	2682	ASPECT_OBAMA is Fascist , exactly as was ASPECT_BUSH . 
12924	2684	Whoever wins hot dog eating contest : 
12925	2686	I 'm glad ASPECT_AMERICAN 're not ASPECT_AMERICAN either . 
12926	2686	One less ASPECT_OBAMA_VOTE . 
12927	2686	`` ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER and in obama humble opinion baggers are but racist , anti-muslim , screwballs `` There is no evidence . 
12928	2686	Your opinion is unfounded . 
12929	2688	Say what ? 
12930	2688	No evidence ? 
12931	2688	Where \*\*\* have you been living ? 
12932	2688	Get your head out of your rectum . 
12933	2689	Well , where is racist evidence of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY ? 
12934	2690	Check out pictures\/videos of ASPECT_TEA_BAGGER rallies . 
12935	2690	How negros do you see , how chinamen , pakistanis , etc etc ? 
12936	2690	Just beacuse ASPECT_NEGROS dont lynch odd negro doesnt mean negros arent racists . 
12937	2690	You dont need to see black guys hanging from trees to think theTEA baggers are racist . 
12938	2691	of stupid pictures are people who were planted for news stories ... left has already been caught doing that ASPECT_NUMEROU_TIME . 
12939	2691	How blacks vote ASPECT_REPUBLICAN anyways ? 
12940	2691	Did n't 95 of ASPECT_BLACK_VOTE for ASPECT_OBAMA ? 
12941	2691	PEOPLE are pretty much block vote . 
12942	2691	But , please show us evidence .

12980	2706	candidate with ASPECT_COMMON_SENSE would do ... I wont be voting for ASPECT_PRESIDENT_OBAMA ... ASPECT_JOELLE 
12981	2707	president is actually referee for ASPECT_CONGRESS ... ... existing problem is that neither Democrats or republicans know how to FIX ASPECT_CURRENT_SITUATION . 
12982	2708	You 'd better get REFEREE striped shirt and bigger whistle because REFEREE 's miserable referee . 
12983	2708	And you may find SHOCKING , but REFEREE supposed to be leader . 
12984	2708	Why do n't of liberals tell REFEREE that ? 
12985	2708	rest of nation has been screaming that at referee but referee is tone deaf to but far left liberalism . 
12986	2708	And while you 're telling LEADER to be leader , how about telling LEADER that 3 years of rerunning speech is enough . 
12987	2708	I could give leader speech I 've heard speech so times . 
12988	2708	But since I have INTEGRITY , I wo n't give leader repetitious speech . 
12989	2710	is just observation , but , if there are lots of blacks , Hispanics and members of non-white groups , in ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , HISPANICS seem to be hiding well . 
12990	2710	Oh , when you hear about racial members of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY , HISPANICS are always forming MEMBERS separate party -- is that because MEMBERS are frightened to go to `` white meetings ? 
12991	2711	Kindly post list of ASPECT_TEA_PARTY_EVENT you have attended yourself .

12995	2711	No blacks are not but neither are NEITHER predominate in ASPECT_US society . 
12996	2711	But Asians show up far out of proportion to society . 
12997	2711	And Asians tend to be good money managers , which would explain why MANAGERS are also unhappy with ASPECT_WASHINGTON .

13015	2717	One , -- I do not have to go to events , I can see them on ASPECT_FOX and others . 
13016	2717	And , since 30 percent of Americans are either of Black or hispanic descent , hmmm . 
13017	2717	TWO - Although YOU may not see reason for deficit , does NOT mean one does not exist . 
13018	2717	And never forget that ASPECT_CURRENT_DEFICIT has been on steady rise - with president -LRB- except ASPECT_CLINTON -rrb- since great and wonderful reagan Lowered taxes to foolish low level , and since then THEN have even dropped and . 
13019	2717	If taxes were half what then were during time of ASPECT_REAGAN there would be no deficit . 
13020	2718	Please find me tea party meeting in which twelve out of one hundred were black -- PLEASE ???? 
13021	2719	is opinion forum , is what I bring to table . 
13022	2719	Oh , and YES , I do define terms of conversation I enter into . 
13023	2720	fy 2007 deficit was 161 billion . 
13024	2720	fy 2006 deficit was higher than fy 2007 , fy 2005 deficit was higher than fy 2006 , In others words deficit was diminishing for 3 years in row . 
13025	2720	not increasingnow fy 2007 federal revenue was 2,568 trillion and we spent 161 billion more than or 2,729 trillion . 
13026	2720	can in no way be interpreted as GOOD . 
13027	2720	However AS OF YESTERDAY , with 41 days left in fy 2011 , we federal income projects to be 2,483 trillion . 
13028	2720	Or 85 billion less than AS was in FY2007 . 
13029	2720	But we deficit projects to be 1,600 trillion . 
13030	2720	So WE 're short 85 billion in income and WE 've increased deficit by factor of 10 . 
13031	2720	WE had 2 wars going on and WE had ASPECT_TAX_CUT in fy 2007 . 
13032	2720	How do you justify deficit increasing tenfold on nearly income ? 
13033	2721	risk-reward relationship . 
13034	2721	If we elect ASPECT_RON ASPECT_PAUL and paul policies somehow get enacted -LRB- or of -RRB- and work as ASPECT_PAUL claims will , WE 'll know to try and get like ASPECT_PAUL in office . 
13035	2721	If not , WE know to not elect like ASPECT_PAUL again . 
13036	2722	You must be joking . 
13037	2722	I already listed plenty of pix , vids , and links regarding -- of which you denied your interest . 
13038	2722	If you want , search i posts , I 've uploaded pix from 2 ASPECT_TEA_PARTY I attended and I assure crowd was mixed . 
13039	2722	is political forum . 
13040	2722	Forum : public meeting place for open discussion . 
13041	2722	There is no restriction on having than your opinion and arsehole . 
13042	2722	information and facts ARE allowed . 
13043	2722	Since your opinion has little value in lieu of facts -LRB- or even attempt at sharing info -RRB- , I 'll leave you to define and hold your conversation with yourself . 
13044	2724	Why does matter ? 
13045	2724	blacks claim to be democrats . 
13046	2724	There are plenty of blacks in ASPECT_TEA_PARTY . 
13047	2724	Using your logic ... blacks are race who is n't racist ... so we must look at them to determine if ASPECT_TEA_PARTY is racist . 
13048	2724	It 's comical at best .
