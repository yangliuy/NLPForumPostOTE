823	Yosh Shmenge	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	319	Funny, I thought we had such an emergency that his program couldn't be put off even a day more.That was then, I suppose.There is news about how the Obama care will actually cost more than promised (surprised) and how large corporations are going to end their having health care for their employees (swelling the ranks of those without, and raising costs even more).
824	Yosh Shmenge	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	319	So if the sky isn't falling, it's because the Obama health care isn't even running yet.Are you ignorant of the facts, or just disingenuous?
825	BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	So in effect when one stays home their unvote went for the candidate that wins.
826	BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	In your case you helped elect Obama.

828	BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	I'm speaking in general about non-voters.Each vote is important, many have fought and died for our privilege (not right) to vote and every election has consequences as has been and continues to be seen.
829	BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	I too hope that true statesmen would run for office not the sycophants that we've had to settle for these past many, many years.
830	BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	I suppose the problem is that there's so few of the earlier and too many of the latter.
831	BFOJ	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	324	We would even recognize a real statemen in this time and day?Though I can't think of any statesmen at this time, perhaps someone might offer a name or two of such.
832	SideTraKd	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	325	Portray it anyway you want to, I could no more stomach the idea of consenting to a McCain presidency than I could to Obama's.I made it very clear to my fellow Republicans before we even got close to the primaries that I would never support him, and would refuse to vote if they chose to nominate him.I would rather see a real liberal Democrat remind Americans of how bad they are, than put another RINO in the White House and have the majority of Americans continue to blame us for what are basically liberal policies.The differences between Obama and McCain were so minimal to me as to not be worthy of a choice.
833	onalandline	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	326	Oh yeah, Obama is a world peace-maker and problem-solver!

842	SideTraKd	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	331	Just various degrees of liberal bad.
843	Iriemon	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	332	Wasn't even close, IMO.

850	Shiva_TD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	333	Not completely but certainly a major improvement over the prior adminstration.

853	Shiva_TD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	333	Congress has not helped that problem by creating a new trillion entitlement program with the HCR bill.BTW better to raise taxes than to continue with the deficits.
854	Shiva_TD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	333	As has every president in history.

926	Someone	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	346	It will depends on who the Republicans put forward for a candidate.

930	JavaBlack	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	347	Both were pretty similar to Obama's aside from a few details.Then there was Boehner's bill, which is the one considered a &quot;Republican bill.&quot; And, yes, it was a joke.

1123	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	430	People who've had a job know what I mean.
1124	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	430	And you don't think those Senators know they have a cushy position, terrific benefits, health insurance you'll never have, a pension beyond description, all expenses paid, and on an on.
1125	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	430	I know you're struggling to make sense of all this but to tell you the truth, the only thing left in my wallet now is cents, not sense.
1126	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	431	Again you are assuming democrats do not support securing the border.
1127	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	431	We do.
1128	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	431	We just don't support kicking people who have already established a life and family here out.
1129	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	432	I guarantee you've never had a job that held as much responsibility as a US senator.
1130	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	Wanting to save and actually saving are two different things.
1131	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	Guess how many families can save now?
1132	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	How many even have a job, a home, a hope?No, times have changed.
1133	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	The unending pool of money that the government use to have (our money mind you) is no longer.
1134	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	It's credit all we have yet the government still continues to spend, spend, spend us into oblivion.
1135	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	433	Now if you have access to a gravy train, please share it with us.
1136	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	I agree.
1137	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	But we are talking about wants.
1138	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Not dos.
1139	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Both republicans and democrats have wants for what to cut.
1140	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	But both fail to make the cuts.
1141	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	The republicans consistently fail to make cuts to.
1142	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Anyone and everyone will consistently fail to make cuts for as long as we are unwilling to make the sacrifice for what we are already spending and raise taxes to cover it.As long as Americans can still go shopping at the mall they don't really care about cutting spending.
1143	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Like I sad...there isn't a single big ticket item that the American people broadly support cutting.
1144	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	434	Nothing gains over 20&#37; support for cutting.If we raised taxes and put a fire under American butts you can be sure we will pick something to cut and fast.
1145	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	No, I don't think Democrats want to secure the border, they want those new potential Democrat voters.
1146	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	So we should just willy-nilly let anyone cross over to establish a life and family here without regard to whether it's legal or not.
1147	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	They knew if beforehand that it was wrong, but they came anyway.
1148	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	Kind of like a criminal knowing what they are doing is wrong but not expecting to get caught and suffer the consequence.
1149	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	Perhaps you want to spend your hard earned (or is that hardly earned) money on them, but I don't.
1150	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	My preference to to help those American citizens and legal immigrants who have a need.You're all emotional, suggesting we want to kick people out.
1151	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	No, we want them to follow the laws of this land as you (I think) and I do.
1152	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	So stop with the crybaby tactic and be a man that wants to ensure the health and security of this nation.
1153	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	435	No different than what any country would want and expect.
1154	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	They are raising taxes as we write and the fire they are putting under American butts is what is stemming the tide of continued wasteful spending.
1155	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	No longer is spending the catch phrase, it's holding the line.
1156	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	You want your taxes raises, go for it.

1158	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	Our representatives are starting to get the message and you see how many of them are leaving congress and losing primaries.
1159	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	436	Yep, as it should be.You raise taxes, you increase spending, it's as simple as that.
1160	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	That's gotta be the most backward ass conspiracy theroy I've ever heard lol.
1161	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	How the hell are illegal immigrants going to vote?
1162	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	They can't even become naturalized citizens if they are illegal.
1163	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	And what about the American citizen children of illegal immigrants?
1164	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	Are we supposed to rip their parents away from them?
1165	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	I fail to see how I'm being emotional.
1166	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	You're the one calling me a cry baby lol.The fact is yes they broke the law but they're here.
1167	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	And many of them have been here for decades.
1168	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	They've established a life here and it's completely inhumane to relocate them to a place they are no longer familiar with.
1169	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	Especially if they have children who are American citizens.I mean hey if they've been here for a year or two then yeah, deport them.
1170	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	But if they've been here for many years or they have children here then what's the point.
1171	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	437	Clearly they aren't hurting anyone by being here.
1172	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	I want to cut spending too.
1173	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	But I'm telling you it's not going to happen.
1174	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	You can say you want to all you want but it's not going to happen.
1175	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	No one cuts spending when they are living a comfortable life.
1176	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	People only cut spending when they are forced to.
1177	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	This is why Obama's pay-go law is such a good law.
1178	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	If we pass a spending bill then there should be revenue that goes with it.
1179	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	If we aren't making sacrifices for our high spending then there is no incentive to cut spending.
1180	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	So you can ride your high horse all you want pretending you're the only one who wants to cut spending.
1181	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	When in fact everyone wants to cut spending.
1182	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	We just can't agree on what to cut because none of us are actually sacrificing enough to feel we need to cut things we actually want to be able to spend money on.Let me ask you this.
1183	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	I want to see a cut in defense spending by 50%.
1184	TheTaoOfBill	BFOJ	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	438	Would you support this cut?
1185	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	You're repeating yourself.
1186	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	You assume we support kicking people out of here.
1187	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	Again, they knew what they did was wrong before they did it, sounds like a planned crime to me. Suffer the consequences.
1188	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	440	Besides they have a home in the land they came from.

1195	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	441	Typical rich representatives that care about the poor.
1196	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	441	Don't make me laugh.
1197	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	Duh!
1198	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	Democrats want to legalize the illegal immigrant, this is how they'll get the vote.
1199	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	There are many, many American children living around the world to non-American parents.
1200	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	What's the big deal?
1201	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	The problem is the parents came here illegally, remain here illegally, the children will do just fine with their parents elsewhere.Ok, I see a little movement on your part.
1202	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	How the heck are we suppose to know how long they lived here, they're illegal, no documentation?
1203	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	Obviously many are hurting others here, look at the rise in crime rates in those areas swarming with illegals.
1204	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	442	I suppose you are ok with this since you probably live in a white only neighborhood.

1207	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	444	You have it all backwards.

1216	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	446	You referring to Senators?

1219	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	You only address part of my response.
1220	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	I did not say I wouldn't support defense spending, but 50%, that's what our enemies would like.
1221	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	I mentioned where I think the spending should be.
1222	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	But apparently you like to be taxed and don't care about continued spending.
1223	BFOJ	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	447	Mighty big of you to spend my money too.

1683	Shiva_TD	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	601	People are delusional if they believe that cutting $15-20 billion in pork barrel spending will eliminate a trillion dollar annual deficit and I don't believe that independents are that delusional.
1684	Shiva_TD	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	601	They know what needs to be cut even though they are probably calling for cuts in programs they support in principle.

2034	Shiva_TD	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	717	The Republicans would certainly reflect absolute stupidity to run the worst part of their 2008 ticket as their 2012 presidential candidate.
2035	Shiva_TD	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	717	Hopefully they will actually nominate a good candidate but it is doubtful based upon past history.
2036	Shiva_TD	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	719	One of the problems we have is that elections are not carried by voting for candidates so much as voting against candidates.
2037	Shiva_TD	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	719	I believe Obama was elected with the support of independents who were fundamentally voting against the McCain/Palin ticket.
2038	Shiva_TD	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	719	It was a choice between &quot;two evils&quot; and the independents selected the lessor of the two evils.
2039	Shiva_TD	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	719	Americans will probably be faced with the same choice in 2012.
2040	onalandline	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	721	I don't think so, but you are entitled to your opinion.
2041	onalandline	fpolitics	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	721	Obama has done more damage in 1 1/2 years than Bush did in all 8.
2042	Shiva_TD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	722	Let's see, the entire economy was imperiled by the Bush adminstration's lack of attention and neglect of the United States while off waging wars based upon unsupported and often false allegations which resulted in as many as one million innocent people dying while also leaving the government with over a trillion dollar budgetary deficit in 2009 and having doubled the entire national debt in only 8 years.
2043	Shiva_TD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	722	I'm not a fan of Obama's but he is going to have to do quite a bit more the equal the damage done to the United States by the prior adminstration.
2044	TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	I really can't see how he's the same as Bush.
2045	TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	He's working to get DADT repealed.
2046	TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	He passed a major stimulus bill that Bush would have never touched.
2047	TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	And he completely reformed healthcare in a way Bush never would have done.
2048	TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	Not to mention he has a more sensible tax plan and his policies are actually improving the economy rather than destroying it.He's not perfect.
2049	TheTaoOfBill	Bluespade	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	723	But he's leagues above Bush.
2050	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	Besides for the throw in about globalists(that is a small thing anyways), I agree with almost your entire post.
2051	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	I also voted for Obama, and I now regret it and will never vote for Obama, or a Democrat of any kind for that matter, ever again.
2052	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	You are right.
2053	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	I was too young to remember Clinton.
2054	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	I became politically aware under Bush, and all I knew was that Bush was a really terrible president.
2055	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	I figured that if we got Bush out, it would be a major improvement, and I really had high expectations for Obama.
2056	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	Instead he passed a mandate that required all people to give more money to private health care companies.
2057	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	He has failed to stop rendition, close Guantanamo, stop torture, get us out of Iraq, open talks with Iran, etc. I don't necessarily agree with all of those issues(guantanamo for example is just political football, even if we closed it we just would have moved the people somewhere else without actually changing anything substantial), but if he had lived up to those promises it would show me that he is not just any other politician.
2058	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	He of course has not.I now realize is it is all political theater.
2059	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	There is no right wing or left wing media, there is only the corporate media.
2060	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	NBC, Fox, CNN, and all other news networks all receive their revenues from advertising dollars from the exact same corporations.
2061	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	It is the interests of those corporations the media represents, not any ideological viewpoint.
2062	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	They simply need to have fox news distract right wingers from the legitimate issues facing this country, and all other media sources to distract all other people from the legitimate problems facing this country.
2063	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	As you said, anyone who thinks there is a major difference between Democrats and Republicans in action is a twit.
2064	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	There rhetoric may be radically different, but when was the last time a conservative balanced the budget and when was the last time a liberal passed a significant piece of social welfare legislation that was not just a giant handout to health care providers?
2065	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	Bush and Reagan spent like drunk sailors, and Clinton gutted welfare.
2066	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	They don't actually live up to the rhetoric that they spout.
2067	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	It is simply a way to keep the normal people of this country occupied.
2068	frodly	Til the Last Drop	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	726	So they make up fake issues like Obama is a socialist, or look at how much Sarah Palin spent on shoes, or Michael Jackson died(even better), or any other element of the political or pop culture circus to distract us all from the political realities currently facing this country.
2069	frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	728	That video is something put together by a schizophrenic lunatic, and anyone who takes it seriously is an embarrassment to the human race.
2070	frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	728	With all the legitimate criticisms that can be made of any politician, Barrack Obama very much included, why are right wingers obsessed with the most insane and off the wall criticisms.
2071	frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	728	He was actually born in Kenya!!

2076	frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	728	It is the height of irrationality.

2083	TheTaoOfBill	Adventure Wolf	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	732	Obama is one of the most conservative democrats to run in awhile.
2084	TheTaoOfBill	Adventure Wolf	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	732	On a global standard he's center right.
2085	TheTaoOfBill	Adventure Wolf	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	732	Most of major accomplishments have been too conservative for those on the left.
2086	Dware	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	733	You are out of your mind man.Name one president who passed (borrowed from the chinese) a 800 BILLION dollar &quot;stimulus&quot; and passed a 4 TRILLION dollar healthcare welfare plan for fat lazy poor people to get free drugs.Osama is by far the most EXTREME lefty to ever step foot in the White House.And look what happens..10% unemployment and 6 million lost jobs
2087	glen65	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	734	Just because he hasn't come through on various things promised doesn't necessarily mean he leans less to the left than previouslythought.
2088	glen65	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	734	It just means that he has failed to accomplish what was promised.
2089	candycorn	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	735	Yeah, you're right, Bush only spent 700 Billion in his last days and spent 11 trillion largely on a war of choice in Iraq.
2090	TheTaoOfBill	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	736	Bush passed a 1.8 trillion dollar stimulus comprised completely of corporate tax cuts.
2091	TheTaoOfBill	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	736	also his 600 dollar tax rebate stimulus cost about 150 billion.
2092	TheTaoOfBill	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	736	Reagan's tax cuts cost us even more than Bush's as a percentage of our GDP.
2093	Dware	candycorn	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	737	The ENTIRE war for 7 years while Bush was in office was 600 Billion dollars, for 7 years of war.Where in the hell are you getting 11 Trillion dollars brah?

2096	candycorn	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	740	I'll cop to that.
2097	candycorn	Dware	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	740	I withdraw the figure and apologize.

2100	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	741	I will either not vote, or vote for some independent liberal.
2101	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	741	I would vote for nader, but I don't think he will run again.
2102	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	741	Hopefully some one takes his place, and I will vote for them.
2103	Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	742	I'll end up voting for somebody that'll get like 0.3% of the vote, but at least I'll feel better.
2104	Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	742	God knows I'm not voting Republican.
2105	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	743	Yep same here.
2106	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	743	I will vote for some one who gets almost no votes, but I will feel better than voting for Obama or any other Democrat, and I would never vote for a Republican either.
2107	glen65	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	744	Reagan's tax cuts did no such thing.
2108	glen65	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	744	It was spending increases on thepart of a democrat controlled congress.
2109	glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	745	How will assisting in your own sides loss make you feel better?
2110	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	746	If Obama runs again, I think he will win.
2111	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	746	But independent of this, why should I vote for anybody for any other reason than because I agree with them?
2112	glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	747	Obama hasn't really changed his philosophical stance on the issues, what's&quot;not&quot; to agree with?
2113	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	748	I would have voted for him in 2008 if I was old enough to.
2114	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	748	He ran to the left of where he's been during his time in office.
2115	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	748	I don't think that's debatable.
2116	glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	749	I most certainly is debatable,Just because he has failed to come through on certaincampaign promises doesn't mean he's changed his philisophicalstances.
2117	glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	749	It simply means he failed to come through as promised.
2118	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	750	It's not that he hasn't come through, it's how he goes about not coming through, ya dig?
2119	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	750	He's too willing to compromise to the Nth degree with a party that will vote against everything he or the Democrats propose, a party that has a significant portion that believes he is a Socialist and/or he's not even a citizen of this country.
2120	glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	751	Obama will receive your vote again.When the election finally gets here you'll realize even more just how important your vote is, and will not want to waste it on some nobody candidate.
2121	glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	751	You will then hold your noseand hit the switch for Obama once again.
2122	candycorn	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	752	Wouldn't it be good to see him push for his policies even when he doesn't have the votes at the time when the bill is introduced?
2123	candycorn	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	752	I totally agree with your post on his being pragmatic.
2124	candycorn	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	752	However, there is a time to go with the crowd and there is a time to lead.
2125	candycorn	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	752	I haven't seen him lead much.
2126	glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	753	Compromise?
2127	glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	753	He could care less what the republicans want.What happened with health care should be plentyevidence of that.
2128	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	754	They threw in a bunch of amendments I do recall.
2129	glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	755	Those amendments mean little to nothing in overall scheme of things.What's more important is that none of the republicans voted for it.
2130	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	756	They weren't going to vote for it no matter what he proposed.
2131	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	757	I guarantee you that I won't.
2132	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	758	No, it means his rhetoric does not match his action.
2133	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	758	I don't care what Obama says he believes, I don't care what his philosophical stances are, I care what his actions are.

2135	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	758	For me to forgive those actions because I agree with many of the things he says would be very stupid.
2136	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	No what is important is that there was no public option, and there was a mandate.
2137	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	A mandate that is basically a giant handout to health care providers.
2138	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	There has also been no significant financial reform.
2139	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	No further environmental reform.
2140	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	No comprehensive progressive energy bill.
2141	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	The Republicans voted against it as political theater.
2142	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	They spent a year convincing their followers that obama was an evil socialist, and that health care reform was an example of evil socialism.
2143	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	It would have been impossible for them to have then voted for the bill.
2144	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	It also perpetuates the myth that there is some fundamental difference between the 2 parties.
2145	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	Both parties are controlled by the same special and corporate interests, and persuaded by the same lobbyists on a daily basis.
2146	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	It is the interests of those groups both parties represent, not any overarching ideology.
2147	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	759	Why would I vote for one party over the other, when the outcomes on every important issue are going to be pretty much the same.
2148	glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	760	Even if that were true, so what?
2149	glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	760	The democrats managed to win a super majority and the republicans didn't &quot;and still don't&quot; have the power to stop anything.
2150	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	761	They don't have to as long as the Democrats' own majority does that for them.

2153	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	763	The Democrats stop the Democrats.
2154	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	763	That's the point.
2155	glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	764	You're kind of missing the point,It being said that his recent actions (or lack thereof) is proof that he has all of the sudden shifted right philosophically.
2156	glen65	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	764	I believe when it comes to his ideology he is as liberal as he ever was.
2157	glen65	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	765	If the process gets stopped up with the number of democratscurrently in office then you need to focus on what wrong with them,not the republicans.
2158	Agent Zero	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	766	I am.

2160	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	What are you saying??
2161	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	That supports my position, it does not weaken it.
2162	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	Democrats had a super majority for almost a year.
2163	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	They could have gotten a public option, real financial reform, reformed social security in a liberal fashion, improved the welfare state, etc. What did they do instead?
2164	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	They got almost nothing done in that year, and then blamed Republicans for stopping them, when as you pointed out, Republicans had no means by which to stop them.
2165	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	So they are full of (*)(*)(*)(*).
2166	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	767	Why would I vote for them?
2167	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	768	That is because your belief is clearly based on irrational partisanship.
2168	frodly	glen65	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	768	If you instead based your beliefs on reality, your beliefs would quickly change.

2170	frodly	Sadistic-Savior	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	770	Or is it the same as no, which would then make me think you could just use the no option available....

2214	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	Which Rush and his acolytes are against (because he might raise their taxes and he'd have to buy a smaller mansion).
2215	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	Thus he wants the economy to fail, even if millions more Americans lose their jobs and homes, because then Obama fails.
2216	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	Which is why Rush and the other Murdoch mouthpieces constantly emphaisize the negative about the economy and ignore the positives.
2217	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	794	They know that if they can help create less confidence in the economy, that will help drag it down.

2228	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	798	Turn on Rush on any given day and he is constantly talking about how badly the economy is doing.
2229	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	798	IMO, if you feel that way, the patriotic and American thing to do would be to try to elect representatives who share your view and you can repeal the health care and deprive those tens of millions of Americans of health care coverage and everything will be hunky dory for you again like it was.But hoping the economy goes to the (*)(*)(*)(*)can so Obama fails while millions lose their jobs and homes is not.
2230	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	798	In my opinion.

2326	EvilWriter	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	834	He'll have the establishment of both parties against him.

2356	daisydotell	Bull Hubbard	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	848	Sounded exotic and so foreign, now Leroy or Wille for that matter would have been just another name that wouldn't have garnered any interest.

2403	mertex	Rapunzel	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	877	That was a tough one.
2404	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	880	At this point in his presidency, Reagan's approval rating was around 45% and falling.
2405	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	880	Less than half approved of his performance at that time.
2406	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	880	And he had had the advantage of being shot.
2407	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	880	http://online.wsj.com/public/resourc...pp0605-31.htmlJust kind of shows how unreliable polls are as predictors of future events, eh?
2408	Dr. Righteous	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	883	You call being shot an advantage?
2409	Dr. Righteous	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	883	Maybe that's your idea of a good time, but it's not mine and Mr. Reagan's.
2410	Iriemon	Dr. Righteous	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	884	For popularity purposes it is.
2411	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	885	That's very interesting.
2412	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	885	IMO, what you have to look at then is future actions.
2413	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	885	If Barack takes his cues from Reagan, I have no doubt he will win reelection in a landslide just like Reagan did.
2414	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	886	Pass a big tax increase in his 3d year like Reagan did?We can only hope Obama doesn't follow Reagan's example on the deficits.
2415	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	886	So far he is though.
2416	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	887	If he had slashed tax rates, he could get away with a small tax rate increase.
2417	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	887	Alas.
2418	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	887	Exactly which &quot;big tax increase&quot; are you referring to?http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/151.html
2419	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	887	I love it when Barack supporters talk about responsible spending.
2420	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	887	:P
2421	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	888	Unfortunately, unlike Reagan, we don't have the luxury today (in large part because of his policies) of having a low debt to GDP ratio where we can afford to triple the deficits and debt.
2422	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	888	Social Security in 1983, and Deficit Reduction Act 1984
2423	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	888	I agree.
2424	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	888	I supported Clinton because she was the one who was most serious about this issue and had the best plan to address the deficits.
2425	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	I don't care what the economy is doing, it is never a good idea to try to spend your way into prosperity.
2426	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	Never.
2427	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	I gave you a link to tax rates.
2428	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	I believe you are confusing tax revenues with tax rates.
2429	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	Show me where personal income tax rates went up.
2430	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	I'm not saying they didn't.
2431	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	I just can't find it.
2432	The12thMan	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	889	McCain may not have been a great candidate, but he had far more credibility on the spending issue than any of the democrats.
2433	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	890	I agree.It can be a good idea to spend your way out of a recession/depression cycle, however.
2434	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	890	I didn't say personal income tax rates went up.SS tax rates when up about 20%, from 5% to 6%http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/taxRates.htmlThe 1984 act was a landry list of tax code changes.The effects are summarized here:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReaganomicsThis link also notes a 1982 tax increase as well:http://www.capitalgainsandgames.com/...-tax-increasesMcCain may not have been a great candidate, but he had far more credibility on the spending issue than any of the democrats.[/quote]
2435	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	Really?
2436	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	So in your mind, 15% unemployment is preferable to a larger deficit and debt?
2437	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	The largest problem with that argument, is that when you have a recession or a depression, you will lose large amounts of revenue anyways.
2438	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	You could say, we need to cut spending in response to those decreases in revenue, but that would lead to very undesirable economic outcomes.
2439	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	We could also raise taxes to make up for the loss in revenue, again the problem is that will also lead to undesirable economic outcomes.
2440	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	So how do you deal with the problem?
2441	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	The answer is, it is very difficult in our current political climate.
2442	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	It isn't very difficult solution either, but political posturing makes sane economic decisions almost impossible.
2443	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	What some one with some knowledge of economics would say, is that you balance the budget over the business cycle, not on a year to year basis.
2444	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	Which means spending and tax policy should fluctuate.
2445	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	When their is a recession or a depression, you raise spending and cut taxes, which then stimulates the economy.
2446	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	When the economy is booming, you cut spending and raise taxes.
2447	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	The economy can handle those changes in times of prosperity, and then you make up for the deficits that are accrued during tough economic times.
2448	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	The problem is our economic policy is not particularly rational.
2449	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	Neither side ever cuts spending during good economic times, and Republicans oppose tax hikes at all times.
2450	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	That makes conducting policy in a reasonable way, meaning balancing the budget over the business cycle, almost impossible.
2451	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	Instead we have Republicans who want to cut taxes, without actually enacting spending cuts, all while the economy is strong.
2452	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	And democrats who want to raise taxes, but want to do so even when it is economically inadvisable.
2453	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	892	It is economic posturing, and it is very bad for the country.
2454	The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	893	Nice leap of logic.

2456	The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	893	IMO, it has changed a slow recovery into a stagnate one.

2460	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	894	I was not claiming that without increased spending, we would have 15&#37; unemployment, though I feel confident it would be higher.
2461	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	894	I am asking a simple hypothetical and philosophical question about the importance of combating unemployment measured against the importance of combating debt.
2462	The12thMan	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	895	The question does not make sense.

2465	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	Despite your beliefs, the idea that government spending stimulates the economy is not very controversial among economists.
2466	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	It is widely accepted to be true(though a minority does exist that questions that fact).
2467	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	You may believe that the stimulus did not do enough to justify it's costs, but to claim it hurt recovery, is first of all unprovable, and second of all actually a leap of logic on your part.
2468	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	896	What evidence do you have to support your claim that the stimulus hurt the recovery?

2476	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	901	It has nothing to do with collecting unemployment benefits or not.
2477	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	901	It has to do with actively seeking employment vs not seeking employment.
2478	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	901	There are some people who do want to work, but are not seeking work, who are not in the work force, but how do you determine that number?
2479	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	901	It is impossible, so basically you or some one else, just made that number up.

2504	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	Government spending boosts aggregate demand, therefore boosting the economy.

2506	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	There is no doubt that it also offers a work disincentive, but in economic downturns, that disincentive is pretty irrelevant.
2507	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	People are not out of work at the moment, because they get unemployment insurance, and therefore have no reason to look for work.

2511	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	If the government gives them unemployment benefits, they will spend that money, thereby stimulating the economy.
2512	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	It isn't that complicated either.
2513	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	903	Unemployed people use the income they receive from the government, which then increases demand, consumption, etc. Which then can create jobs.

2563	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	917	But I certainly agree, Obama needs to raised taxes and trim spending to get the deficits down.

2566	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	920	I was only addressing your first point.But my comments on your second point are two:1) You don't know that the tax cuts did not create jobs.
2567	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	920	They may have created lots of jobs, its just that the number of jobs being lost from the recession was greater until recently.2) Tax cuts won't create more jobs in the near term if those who receive the tax cuts don't spend the money and instead save it or use it to pay down debt, as was happening in this recession.
2568	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	920	That's why tax cuts are not a panacea and don't work as well as direct spending for creating jobs in a recession.

2691	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	948	A poll of voters released today.The question,In the NEXT [2012] Presidential election, would you vote for Obama or &quot;A Republican.&quot; Not this Republican or that Republican, just &quot;A Republican.&quot;The result?A Republican 42%Obama 37%obummer, cannot even beat a 'generic' Republican.I'd bet if it was against, &quot;Another Democrat?&quot; obummer would lose that one too.Had they asked, &quot;An Independent?&quot;obummer would have gotten blown off the board.
2692	Bassman	Silverhair	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	950	And the kicker is right now, the tide is favoring the GOP retaking at least the House in November, and not just the so-called &quot;establishment&quot; RINO Republicans, but far more Conservative Republicans to boot!

2695	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	Look at his website, or the website I previously posted, or the library of Congress's website.
2696	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	This is and always has been Democratic policy.
2697	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	Again, always has been Democratic policy, your saying he's a bad man for following his own party's policy.
2698	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	Before he was elected, President Bush increased our debt to 10.3 trillion, today it is 13 trillion... far less increase.

2702	T.

2703	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	951	Again, check the above website.

2705	mertex	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	952	That they don't want to extend unemployment benefits to those that are hurting and accusing them of not looking for jobs, is just heartless.
2706	mertex	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	952	A real eye-opener for most everyone.

2723	TheTaoOfBill	naturalist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	958	In otherwords you just said the government agency responsible for counting unemployment rates is wrong about how unemployment rates are counted.Do you enjoy being laughably wrong?

2725	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	FOX continues to rise in ratings [even before BO] while NBC, CNN, ABC, and CBS plummet.

2728	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	FOX presents news, not news they like or dislike, THE NEWS.
2729	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	The old, tired, failing, networks are now nothing but advertising agencies for the liberal left.
2730	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	They no longer KNOW what news is, and they can't figure out why they are failing across the board.Watch FOX and you'll be shocked to find that Bill O'Rielly is as strong an Obama defender as ANYONE in the old media.

2732	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	That is presenting 2 sides of a story.Throughout the broadcast day FOX has on STAUNCH Democrats and near and far left liberals.
2733	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	They give them a pulpit and let them present their ideology.
2734	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	The lamestream media USED to do that, now they don't.On Glenn Beck,,,,,No one in the administration, or on the left has PROVED anything that Beck says to be a lie.
2735	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	And he challenges them all to do so regularly.The left CLAIMS he's lying, but not once have they been able to say, &quot;Here is the fact proving Beck was lying.&quot; Beck PROVES the administration is lying on an almost daily basis.FOX presents BOTH sides, the rest present the liberal view ONLY.
2736	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	959	FOX prospers, the rest slowly sink.Keep calling them Faux News, they are laughing at your foolishly closed mind.

2778	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	964	Its a government implanted business regulation.
2779	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	964	Hmmm and yet its not in the headlines any more....
2780	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	964	The false conclusion that I have some trust in our President?
2781	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	964	And actually back him?
2782	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	I find out how this crap is on the table, and how bad it is through the outlets that I watch/listen to - not Obama or Congress.
2783	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	Their goal is to keep us all in the dark and pass this destructive legislation with midnight/weekend votes.
2784	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	Obama is un-American because he is systematically destroying our Constitution and our liberties.

2786	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	They will be record levels.
2787	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	Democrats have no backbone, except the ones that voted against it.
2788	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	They accepted back-door deals from Obama, or were otherwise pressured into voting for it.
2789	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	They were sacrificed for the sake of Obamacare.
2790	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	Businesses that have to pay additional if they exceed their credits, are essentially paying an energy tax.
2791	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	They will recoup their money by passing additional costs to the consumer.

2797	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	965	Hopefully, you will see the light.
2798	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	And where do your outlets get it from?
2799	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	Oh right, Obama and Congress.
2800	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	How else are they to be transparent, you want them to walk up to every person's door and explain every point of their policy?
2801	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	The very thing that criticizes them, they must depend on for being transparent.
2802	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	So far you have no proof to this.
2803	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	He has offered no change to our Constitution and hasn't removed a single liberty.
2804	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	The website YOU posted already disproved this fact.
2805	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	So he convinced all the spineless Democrats to vote for Obamacare.
2806	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	Yet there were some that voted against it.
2807	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	With a need for a majority to pass Obamacare, and a Republican controlled Congress, how exactly was this forced through, with the full weight of R's against it and some D's as well?
2808	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	Then it is not the President's fault.
2809	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	He has performed a measure that would be effective for decreasing energy consumption and also gain the government some more income.
2810	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	It is the companies' fault for not following the set limit.
2811	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	.... what?
2812	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	Are you really trying to counter argue with simply saying a news media will report news?
2813	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	That just simply made my head hurt...
2814	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	966	I have, it's quite dark, African American in fact!
2815	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	It is long because it has to be.
2816	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	We see how the Constitution and Bill of Rights are extensively malleable and dependent on someone's perception.
2817	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	If a bill passes now-a-days, it must be watertight to avoid such flexibility, and that makes a bill long.
2818	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	As for the loopholes, in any bill, there are compromises.
2819	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	With a bill as controversial as this one and enacted right after a very tense and violent campaign, Congressmen are likely to compromise over the bill.
2820	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	Also they add unneeded amendments and money spending called pork barrel.
2821	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	This is done mainly by those who are against the bill in hopes of getting it voted down.
2822	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	969	You are generally insulting an entire government, simply because its opposition put up a fight.
2823	T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	970	Did you know that if you went to the library of Congress you can read every single bill that is currently being voted on?
2824	T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	970	Also you can analyze who put it up for vote, where it is in the voting process, how many nays and ayes there are currently for it, who wrote it and which party they are, when it was introduced, which companies/people are backing the bill, which committee the bill is under, who heads that committee, what that persons political stance on the bill is, how much this bill will cost, who will be paying for it, and approximately how long it will be till it takes effect.Just because President Obama doesn't force Congress to give a daily televised speech on the thousands of bills that pass through it, doesn't mean that it is not becoming more transparent.
2825	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	Barack once promised that every non-emergency bill to come before him would be posted on the WH site for 5 days before he signed it.
2826	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	Took him about one week to break that promise.
2827	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	He's broken it numerous times since.
2828	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	For that matter, has he ever put even one bill on the WH website 5 days before signing it?Kinda funny watching that video NOW.
2829	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	I don't think it's a big deal that he doesn't post bills for public input.
2830	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	971	He doesn't give a crap what people say anyway.
2831	T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	972	Kinda funny that people believed he would have time to and that people find it prudent to look on the executive branch's website for a legislative matter.
2832	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	973	So you knew he was lying?
2833	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	973	Have you ever looked?
2834	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	973	He does post bills there.
2835	The12thMan	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	973	Just not for 5 days.
2836	T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	974	No, I didn't, but its like getting a great dinner and complaining you didn't get desert.
2837	T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	974	Good for him!
2838	T. Hobbes	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	974	I'm glad he does, just wondering why people truly expect an executive website to be solely responsible for reports on legislative matters.
2839	Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	From inauguration, BO had total control of both the House and Senate.
2840	Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	The Democrats could pass any bill they wished in a totally partisan manner.
2841	Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	The Republicans could grumble, but were powerless to stop or even delay, any legislation from day one.
2842	Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	Yet it took BO over a year to pass his signature Health Care bill.
2843	Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	And to pass it, a number of DEMOCRATS had to be bribed and coerced and promised who knows what as a group of them SUDDENLY decided to vote for the HCR and RETIRE.
2844	Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	Net result is a bill that only messes up the health care system and will likely forever change health care insurance, and not for the better.That is not good Government.
2845	Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	The PEOPLE said they did NOT want that Health Care bill.
2846	Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	And now The People say they want the bill repealed and a real bi-partisan bill worked out.BO refused to listen, then and now!
2847	Dan40	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	975	The people WILL speak in November and BO will be forced to listen as he becomes essentially a lame duck halfway through his ONLY term.
2848	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	Republicans have just as much right in Congress to fillibuster, pork barrel, amend, and debate the hell out of any bill, which is probably what happened to this bill.
2849	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	As for bribery and all these other ridiculous claims, has anyone had charges brought against them?
2850	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	Anyone been sued?
2851	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	Anyone confronted with evidence?
2852	T. Hobbes	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	976	Or are these innocuous claims thrown out into the public for the benefit of our great and benevolent leader?
2853	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	Try this.
2854	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	I voted for President Obama.
2855	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	On one hand he is too liberal for me, and on the other too conservative.
2856	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	He is too conservative because he let Wall Street walk all over him, when I was expecting him to kick some corporate ass.He is too liberal for me because he sent the Attorney General to Arizona to sue and stop the Arizona immigration law.
2857	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	The border is out of control, and Obama should be trying to work with Governor Jan Brewer to clean up the criminal illegal alien and anchor baby mess.He did get health care passed which was a major issue for me. Will I vote for President Obama again?
2858	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	I answered &quot;yes,&quot; because I believe Obama/Biden will see the light with the help of American labor when it comes to the issue of illegals.
2859	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	If he does not, I may shop around.
2860	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	Under no circumstances will I vote for Sarah Palin for political office.
2861	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	She is simply incompetent.
2862	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	Some I know are talking of not voting at all.
2863	Batten	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	977	I used to think that was wrong.
2864	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	They were supposed to televise all the HCR debates on C-SPAN and post the bills with sufficient time for the American People to see them.
2865	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	They did not do this.
2866	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	They finally started to post some items, but with only a few days til voting.
2867	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	Not enough time.
2868	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	It's a work in progress.
2869	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	HCR is one example.
2870	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	He has appointed two judges to the Supreme Court who cannot uphold the Constitution, and will legislate from the bench.
2871	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	You're misreading it apparently then.
2872	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	Quit looking at it upside down.
2873	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	You apparently didn't watch the video.
2874	onalandline	T. Hobbes	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	978	You lost me on this one.
2875	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	The most that the Executive branch can do is open the court doors to the media, they cannot force them to come and people to watch.
2876	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	In fact much of the time it WAS televised on C-Span but they promised live coverage and votes were being done at unreasonable hours.
2877	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	I believe he promised w/ in 5 days, aka a few days.
2878	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	And you're saying it isn't their right to do so?
2879	T. Hobbes	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	979	I'm confused, you seem to believe that the President has enormous legislative power, and yet the judicial branch has none.
2880	T.

3086	frodly	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1022	So you would vote for him if he abandoned his own principles, adopted all your principles, not matter how idiotic and wrongheaded those principles were?
3087	frodly	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1022	That is a pretty nonsensical point of view.
3088	frodly	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1022	If Obama adopted those measures, especially the ones about deporting people and economic regression that would come about from stopping free trade, I would sooner vote for my dog as a write in than Obama under those circumstances.I also like the fact that right wingers constantly blather on about the free market.
3089	frodly	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1022	And yet in action, and even specific policy rhetoric they oppose the free market at every turn.
3090	frodly	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1022	Opposition to free trade, is opposition to the free market.

3095	frodly	shpraralain	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1022	The reality is, the right wing agenda can be summed up as, &quot;I want a free market for me, I don't care about anyone else.

3100	frodly	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1023	They were disastrous.

3104	frodly	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1025	Another person irrelevantly pointing out fox news ratings, and comparing them to MSNBC.
3105	frodly	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1025	I am very liberal, and wouldn't watch MSNBC for any reason.
3106	frodly	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1025	I actually watch Fox significantly more often.
3107	frodly	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1025	And if there is a major and serious news story, I watch CNN.
3108	frodly	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1025	That is the difference between the right and left.

3110	historicus	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1026	No.
3111	historicus	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1026	And no where in my post did I suggest that.
3112	historicus	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1026	But from your posts we can all easily conclude that you must be another Obama boot licker too dimwitted to understand the mistake you made.At the time Obama appeared to have outmaneuvred Hillary but was not yet the nominee I summed up how dangerous his Presidency might become based on his inexperience, lack of pragmatism, and liberal ideology.It did not take me 1 year into his Presidency to feel vindicated of the predictions I made during his campaign.
3113	historicus	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1026	The mistakes are frequent, and damaging to the Republic.
3114	Iriemon	The12thMan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1027	Because it shows that notwithstanding the fact that Obama's lower ratings are constantly posted to show what a crummy job he is doing, ratings at this point in his tenure are likely to bear little resemblance to how he is judged in the future.
3115	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1028	Really?Is that why most Obama voters actually thought Sara Palin said she could see Russia from her house in Alaska?That is based on a Zogby study post election.
3116	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1028	The data is on line if you want it.I guess you liberals let Saturday Night Live create reality for you.
3117	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1029	It wasn't a liberal policy to slash tax revenues and double military spending.I can understanding, looking back at the wreckage that is the Bush administration, why conservatives would now what to distance themselves and claim he was a &quot;liberal.&quot;Sorry.
3118	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1029	He's your baby.
3119	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1029	You all put him in office twice.
3120	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1029	We don't want him.
3121	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1030	You nailed it.Private Sector expansion is exactly the opposite of the current regimes goals
3122	historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1031	Stop projecting.Bush, like it or not, was one of the most Liberal Republicans ever elected.And never during his Presidency, were either Chambers of Congress, run by Conservatives.You may be able to rewrite history among conversations with your obtuse liberal friends, but not here.
3123	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1032	Also they don't show a comparison with other candidates.
3124	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1032	That's the REAL question.
3125	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1032	George W. Bush had about a 42&#37; approval rating when he was reelected in 2004.
3126	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1032	Many times....especially in times of war...Americans will choose to keep the guy in charge in charge so as not to mix up war strategy.
3127	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	lol wut?
3128	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Republicans ran the house and senate for 6 years during Bush's rein.
3129	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	You may not like that republicans are called conservatives but that's what they are considered.
3130	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Conservatives.
3131	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	If you want to change what that term means to Americans you can go ahead and try.
3132	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	But you haven't done it yet.
3133	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Conservatives were in charge of the republican party and therefore they were in charge for 6 out of 8 years of Bush.
3134	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Our economy started it's recession in 2007.
3135	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Democrats only gained &quot;control&quot; (if you want to call 49 repubs and 49 dems in the senate control) in 2007.
3136	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	So democrats created a recession within a year of them taking over congress?!
3137	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Man that takes skill!
3138	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Get real.
3139	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	Republicans/conservatives caused this mess.
3140	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	And it's the same ones now opposing Obama every move he makes.
3141	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1033	I think the fact that we are doing the opposite of what these guys want is a good thing.
3142	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1034	Label game playing.Bush ran as a conservative, was supported by conservatives, and followed conservative fiscal policies.
3143	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1034	Again, I appreciate your wanting to disown him.
3144	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1034	Maybe we should trust you all this time?
3145	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1034	There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says fool me once, shame on, shame on you.
3146	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1034	Fool me ... can't get fooled again.
3147	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	I don't understand the reasoning.
3148	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	Liberals voted against Bush and his policies not once.
3149	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	Not twice.
3150	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	But 3 times in the past decade.
3151	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1035	How could Bush possibly be a liberal.
3152	Iriemon	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1036	I think the logic goes ...
3153	Iriemon	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1036	Liberals are to blame for everything, so since the Bush administration was one of the worst in history, he must be a liberal.That's the only way I can figure it.
3154	historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1037	Another dimwitted Obama supporter incapable of critical thought.If Republicans are all Conservatives in your small mind..........Are Democrats all Communists ????thanks in advance
3155	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	She did!!
3156	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	She didn't say &quot;I can see russia from my house&quot; She said something along the lines of this interaction.Interviewer(who I think was Charlie Gibson): What do you say to people that say you don't have enough experience or knowledge of foreign policy issues?&quot;Palin: &quot;Well you know there Charlie, I have been governor of Alaska and you can see Russia from Alaska.
3157	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	That gives me foreign policy experience.&quot;That is a horrendously idiotic statement.
3158	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	It is just as stupid as saying I can see Russia from my house.
3159	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	It conveys the exact same message.
3160	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	SNL just added the house part for a bit of comedic effect.
3161	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	I can't see the significant difference.
3162	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	Maybe you can explain to me why it is ok to say you have foreign policy experience because you can see Russia from a part of your state you have never been to, but it is somehow silly to say the same thing about seeing it from your house.
3163	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	It is exactly the same, and if one is stupider, it is the one Palin said.
3164	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	At least if she could actually see Russia from her house, it might be some form of strange logic.
3165	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1038	Instead she cannot see Russia, has never seen Russia, and her claims that Russia's proximity to Alaska somehow give her foreign policy experience just seem even stupider.
3166	historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1039	Yup.
3167	historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1039	And his poll numbers partly tanked because Conservatives became more and more angry with his policies.As for Label game playing, you appear to be very good at it.
3168	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1040	lol huh?
3169	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1040	THEY ALL CALL THEMSELVES CONSERVATIVE!
3170	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1040	Jesus.
3171	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1040	It's not that hard to understand.
3172	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1040	George W. Bush is what the country thinks of when they think conservative policy.
3173	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1041	ThanksYet, a majority of Obama supporters believe she did.It isnt surprising Obama and his policies attract stupid people.
3174	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1042	There are plenty of stupid people on both sides.
3175	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1042	But if you want to play that game (which is a cheap one) I can show you plenty of polls that show educated people support Obama over Palin.
3176	historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1043	Really?Susan Collins calls herself a Conservative?Scott Brown?Olympia Snow?John McKain (when he isnt running for re-election)?Arlen Specter (see McKain) ???I can go on, but I can see you are not really interested in reality
3177	historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1044	Yup.Look in a mirror.Most Obama boot lickers are, so you at least have company.
3178	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	Yes you are half way there.
3179	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	Reagan's policies led to rapid private sector expansion, followed by rapid private sector collapse.

3181	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	Or we can follow the post WWII Keynsian model that saw the longest period of uninterrupted global expansion in human history.
3182	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	Maybe we never saw one or 2 years of massive growth, but we never saw rapid declines either.
3183	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	If it wasn't for the massive deregulation campaign undertaken between 1981 and 2008, we would not be in the recession we are now in.
3184	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	There can of course be over regulation, and if that occurs some deregulation makes sense.
3185	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1045	But the constant deregulation left the markets to their whims, and we saw the outcomes that followed.
3186	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1046	Yes.

3188	historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1048	thanks.I'll add you to the list of completely ignorant Obama supporters who post here.
3189	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1049	Since you are now resorting to insults I think it is safe to say we have maxed out your intellectual capacity.
3190	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1049	Thanks for playing.

3192	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1049	Have a balloon.
3193	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1050	good grief this is idiotic.Let me know how well all that regulation goes especially when the regulators are busy watching porn instead of doing their jobsand the love affair you boot lickers have with Keynes is quite interesting but you've sort of been backed into a corner defending him
3194	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	In what way was he a liberal?
3195	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	What sort of revisionism is this?
3196	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	Bush was a terrible president, so now we have right wing liars trying to say he was liberal??
3197	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	I suppose there a few issues you could say he was liberal about, immigration for example.
3198	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	But you could also spin that and say he supported the free market, and supported the free movement of labor, so he didn't want to intervene with the market.
3199	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	Which is what strict labor immigration control is. What else was Bush Liberal about?
3200	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	He spent a lot!!
3201	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	But that is a conservative trait in the modern world not a liberal one.
3202	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	The last 3 Republican president we had spent like lunatics.
3203	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	Reagan, Bush, and Bush.
3204	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	Clinton balanced the budget.
3205	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	No liberal would ever advocate for years of insane deficit spending, which is something only the right wing has ever done in this countries history other than the WWII era.What else could even remotely be twisted into a liberal stance?
3206	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	Bush cut taxes.
3207	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	Deregulated.
3208	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	Opposed social freedoms.
3209	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	Opposed abortion.
3210	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	All those things are conservative.
3211	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1051	So your attempts to rewrite history might work among your braindead conservative hand puppets, but not among people with functioning brains.
3212	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1052	Good grief this is idiotic.
3213	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1052	This guy called some other post idiotic, and then his argument was &quot;this is idiotic&quot; followed by irrelevant nonsense and babbling.
3214	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1052	Hilarious when people makes the arguments of a child, and then insult others!!
3215	historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1053	it is not an insult if it is true.Are you going to answer the question.Are all Democrats, communists????that is your logic.Or are you completely wrong suggesting Conservatives held power during the Bush Presidency ??thanks in advance
3216	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1054	No they believed she said exactly what she actually said.
3217	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1054	Only right wing liars tried to distort the facts to change history.
3218	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1054	Sarah Palin did say the ability to see Alaska from her state was a foreign policy credential.
3219	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1054	Something that is undoubtedly stupid, and conveys the exact same message as &quot;I can see russia from my house&quot; even if the wording is different.
3220	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1054	The levels of dishonesty you are stooping to are really low.
3221	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1054	Try to raise your game, you are starting to bore me.
3222	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1055	So, we've some to the point where supporting the Free Market now equals being a Conservativethe Party of JFK died a long time ago.How about the work he did with the drunk Ted Kennedy on education &quot;reform&quot; ??The expansion of government creating the Department of Homeland security ???He spent like a drunken sailor - which is not conservative.
3223	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1056	Of course that was not the question asked.Did she say she could see it from her House?Obama supporters say............Of course she did.Its only boring you because you cant handle the facts.
3224	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Yes it is. That is what modern conservatives do.
3225	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Reagan spent more like a drunken sailor than Bush, and he actually increased the debt more than Bush comparable to the time periods(in other words Bush increased the debt more by a total number, but Reagan a greater percentage).That education reform was not something any liberal would ever support, that is for sure.
3226	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Nor is the oppressive actions taken to fight the war on terror.
3227	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	That is something moderates like Obama do, and conservatives like Bush do.
3228	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Not actual liberals.
3229	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1057	Never.
3230	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	Then you are pointing out irrelevancies.
3231	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	People were confused about the exact wordings of a Palin statement, and that is a sign of what?
3232	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	You remember every word that Palin ever said as an exact quote?
3233	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	Of course not.
3234	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	You remember the basic premise of the things she said.
3235	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	The basic premise of what she said was incredibly similar to &quot;I can see russia from my house&quot; PS.
3236	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	I am liberal and I know exactly what she said.
3237	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	So really, your point is without merit.
3238	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1058	The fact that people got confused about the wording of an answer sarah palin gave is irrelevant to anything I was actually talking about.
3239	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1059	educate yourself will yai even included a Washington Post link first, written in 2007.
3240	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1059	that Bush was a Liberal Republican is not new news, however, considering how you must need him to be a conservative, so your own ideology doesnt get too close to being something of the Soviet Union, or Venezuela's - we can all understand how desperate you need the Bush / conservative myth to be believed.Not that 3 crummy links will change your mind, but heck Cohen and the Wash Post wrote about it years agoBush the Neoliberalhttp://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn...052801053.htmlHow the Policies of the Bush Administration Are Liberal in Theoryhttp://www.associatedcontent.com/art...a_liberal.htmlPresident Bush’s Liberal Viewshttp://www.newdonkey.com/president-b...ral-views.html
3241	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1060	I will accept this as an admission that Obama supporters are more likely to be guided by Saturday Night Live skit than reality.Or that Obama supporters were/are gullible village idiots who actually believed Obama was going to lower taxes, that they could keep their health care, and so on and so onthe hard part for you is, the game is over and Independents (and hopefully some actual real Democrats) finally wised up
3242	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Ah you mean the whole spreading democracy throughout the world.
3243	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Well that was old school American liberalism for sure.
3244	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	The thing is though, that has been the policy of both Republican and Democratic presidents since the start of the cold war.
3245	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Pre-WWII I would agree the conservative position tended to be isolationist and the liberal tended to have more expansive and optimistic foreign policy goals.
3246	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	That hasn't been true very often since that point.
3247	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	And it absolutely hasn't been true at least since the 70sI think your problem is, you seem to be confusing libertarianism with conservatism.
3248	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Even that last link you gave said Bush was conservative, he just believed in some liberal policies.
3249	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	The truth is he is a Reagan style conservative.
3250	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Insane spending.
3251	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Belief in using foreign policy to promote and spread democracy.
3252	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Deregulation.
3253	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Tax cuts.
3254	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	That is Reagan's playbook copied by GW Bush.
3255	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	Yet you seem to like Reagan and call Bush a liberal.
3256	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1062	When they have so many similarities that doesn't make much sense.
3257	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1063	The hard part for you is I strongly oppose Obama's presidency.
3258	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1063	I haven't defended Obama once, and if you look at my vote I said I wouldn't vote for Obama.
3259	frodly	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1063	So that is clearly not the explanation.
3260	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1064	I think your problem is projecting.I am a registered libertarian who voted for Michael Badnerik in 2004, and wrote in Ron Paul in 2008 - and more often than not, voted Libertarians when given a choice.Although I will admit, I have never voted for the communist with the D by their name.
3261	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1064	I apologize for not coming into voting age when Democrats were still Democrats and not Marxists
3262	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1065	Then I apologize for projecting a bit myself
3263	Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	The FACT that Bush was not Conservative, does NOT mean he was a liberal.
3264	Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	He spent like one but didn't tax like one.
3265	Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	Bush was a fiscally bad President.
3266	Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	And probably best called a moderate Republican.
3267	Dan40	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1066	True Conservatives and moderate to conservative Independents agree that Bush left much to be desired, especially in the spending area.What befuddles me [among other things] is how liberals blame Bush for ALL including the excess spending, YET say obummer is doing GOOD by spending 3 times as much?????????I guess the liberal, dreamland, &quot;perfect world,&quot; mind has no need for logic.
3268	historicus	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1067	AgreedI missed where he credited Clinton with balancing the budget and completely ignored the Republican takeover in 94 and the Contract with Americawho believes, had that not happened, Clinton would have balanced the budget with a Democratic controlled House ?
3269	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1068	It was 1995 the Republicans took over.It is speculation as to what would have happened.
3270	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1068	But the Dems passed the 1993 tax increase that flooded the Treasury with revenues which gave us the surplus budget, and the deficit was falling rapidly in those two years before the Republicans got control.
3271	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1068	Furthermore, we saw once Bush got into office that the Republican congress wasn't exactly thrifty when it comes to spending.Year - &quot;on-budget&quot; deficit/surplus1992 -340.41993 -300.4 &lt;- Clinton takes office1994 -258.81995 -226.4 &lt;- Republicans take control of Congress1996 -174.01997 -103.21998 -29.91999 1.9Source: CBO.govThe deficits had already fallen 33&#37; in the years before the Republicans took congress.
3272	historicus	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1069	And this is borderline delusional&quot;Right wing liars&quot; distort the facts and change history when attempting to correct what Saturday Night Live said versus Sara Palin?Its actually quite entertaining.
3273	historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1070	Yes, but it is commonly referred to as the 1994 takeover which is when the election was.Remember it, because we will be referring to Americans taking back the House this time around as the 2010 takeover
3274	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1071	Not in my experience.
3275	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1071	You're not the first who incorrectly stated the Republicans took over in 1994.
3276	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1071	And the Republicans will retain congress in 2002 and McCain will win the election in 2004.
3277	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1071	Folks predict all kinds of things.
3278	historicus	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1072	Like Obama being a pragmatic centrist

3280	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1075	The election was in 1994 but they didn't get into office until 1995.
3281	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1075	Just like Bush had control of the white house when the 2009 deficit was predicted to be a staggering 1.2 trillion dollars even before we knew the full extent of the financial crash.
3282	Iriemon	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1077	What question and who are you addressing?

3292	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1079	That is what Boehner and the rest of the GOP who have their head up so far into their butts they can't see that Wall Street is taking us to the cleaners, and doesn't care because they are in Wall Street's pocket.
3293	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1079	Bwahahah!
3294	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1079	That is why so many Rep Congressmen were so eager to take the money and take photo ops admitting it was creating jobs.
3295	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1079	Your rhetoric reeks of right-wing anger, jealousy and erronious crap.

3299	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1079	Obama handled the crisis much more intelligently than dumb Bush handled Katrina.

3305	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1079	And, DOJ is just keeping with the Constitution, something that Reps/cons don't seem to understand.
3306	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1079	They claim they love the Constitution but don't mind shredding it or letting their leaders (Bush/Cheney) shred it.
3307	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1079	Selfish reps don't have any empathy for those that lost their jobs, they are just interested in helping BP and other corporations keep their millions so they can pay their CEO's big bonuses.
3308	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1079	And it would all be considered BS.

3332	frodly	Bassman	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1094	Did Mertex say the party should sieze control and stop Republicans from taking control?
3333	frodly	Bassman	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1094	Certainly not.
3334	frodly	Bassman	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1094	But anyone who was even semi-conscious between 2001 and 2009 must understand how disastrous Republican control is. Maybe one day people, when they realize Democrats suck, will not then turn to Republicans only to realize they also suck, just to turn back to Democrats.

3344	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1098	Conservatism in it's basic definition is a political ideology that is against new programs.

3346	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1098	Therefore they all fit under the conservative ideology.
3347	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1098	There are multiple subfactions of conservatism.
3348	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1098	Including libertarians.
3349	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1098	But the neo cons of the republican party are no less conservative than the libertarians.I am not wrong.
3350	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1098	I just don't have a political agenda to redefine conservativism to separate it from the neo cons and George W. Bush.
3351	historicus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1099	For the sake of argument I will not correct your flawed definition and statements but accept them to make a point.Following your own logic, and absolute unwillingness to admit you are wrong, then all Democrats are Communists.It isn't much of a secret that they are, but I'd really like to see you type it, or agree with it.Then again, reading you attempt to squirm your way around this, is sufficiently entertaining.
3352	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1100	No because the basic defintion of communism is a desire for the state to take complete control of all businesses.Not a single democrat has proposed any such thing.
3353	TheTaoOfBill	historicus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1100	You are truly doing a poor job displaying your knowledge of political ideologies and their definitions.

3435	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1136	I understood your assertion perfectly the first time.Let me make my position a bit simpler, if I can.A &quot;racist,&quot; by definition, is one who discriminates or is prejudiced against others or villifies them based on their race.
3436	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1136	Now, if a liberal (or anyone else) calls someone a &quot;racist&quot; based not on the person's race, but on their own inability to conduct and intelligent argument, then the liberal is not discriminating or being prejudiced against that person based on race, but based on ignorance, right?
3437	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1136	So by definition, that does not indicate they are racist at all, does it?Now, what were you saying about being able to conduct an intelligent argument?
3438	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1136	In the meantime, the rest of us will just savor the delicious irony of you calling liberals the most racist for calling others racists when being unable to conduct an intelligent argument.
3439	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1137	As a liberal, you naturally want to define racist in the narrowest terms possible.
3440	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1137	However, in reality, [a term foreign to liberals] playing the race card against all and any at every opportunity is RACIST, whether you wish to acknowledge that or not.IE calling the AZ law RACIST when it is not, IS RACIST.
3441	farrar	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1138	A wise man once said:&quot;Racism is simply an ugly form of collectivism, the mindset that views humans only as members of groups and never as individuals.
3442	farrar	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1138	Racists believe that all individual who share superficial physical characteristics are alike; as collectivists, racists think only in terms of groups.
3443	farrar	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1138	By encouraging Americans to adopt a group mentality, the advocates of so-called &quot;diversity&quot; actually perpetuate racism.
3444	farrar	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1138	Their intense focus on race is inherently racist, because it views individuals only as members of racial groups.Conservatives and libertarians should fight back and challenge the myth that collectivist liberals care more about racism.

3452	Iriemon	farrar	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1140	How the hell are conservatives going to fight about it when they don't even know what &quot;racist&quot; means.Here we have Dan40 whose thinks the word &quot;racist&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with anything about race, prejudice, or discrimination.
3453	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1141	So since you are calling liberals racists thereby playing the race card, exactly what you accuse liberals of doing, does not that make you a racist too by your own definition?

3465	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1143	The race card is a liberal weapon to be used against any that disagree with their silly Utopian dreams.
3466	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1143	And using it against all who disagree is a slur against all people of color, so YES, calling people racist when they are not, is an insult, and therefore RACIST.

3481	farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	Here is an elementary example:before--there were 7 yellow people and 3 green ppl unemployed equaling 10&#37; of the populationnow--there are 10 yellow people and 10 green ppl equaling 20% of the populationBefore for instance, they counted yellow and greens in unemployment.
3482	farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	So in this mock example 10% of people are unemployed.
3483	farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	Now they stoped counting green people.
3484	farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	so it looks like only 10% unemployment.
3485	farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	Therefore as far as we know, there has been little change.In real terms the government says we have 10% unemployment and 2% inflation.
3486	farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	In terms we used from the very beginning (before) or unmanipulated... we actually have 22% unemployment and 6% inflation...
3487	farrar	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1148	So yes, the Bureau of labor satistics is kind of bull.

3499	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1155	So say what you want, its meaningless.

3677	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1205	He is an incompetent dreamer or worse.

3679	Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1206	Even Adam Smith advocated &quot;redistributing wealth&quot; in the form of a progressive tax structure.
3680	Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1206	Our federal tax bracket is the lowest it's been in decades.
3681	Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1206	The main idea behind Communism, in theory, was to provide total economic equality because of the huge amount of inequality that Marx witnessed.
3682	Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1206	The only way to do that in an existing system of government is to not tax the lower classes and tax the upper class 100%, caps on income, etc. I don't see anything like that coming from the Obama administration.
3683	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Your inability to see the obvious is not the subject.Economic Equality is an oxymoron.
3684	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Some have the ability to become wealthy, some do not.

3689	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	They waste it one way or another.The more you take from the wealthy, the more you damage everyone, including the poor.
3690	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	NO wealthy person has their stack of money locked in a vault.

3692	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Invigorating the economy and creating jobs, NOT sitting and shrinking from inflation.
3693	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	That IS the only way it can grow.
3694	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	And that benefits the poor MORE than giving them dollars to be wasted.BHO has the incredible blessing of historical timing.
3695	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	He has done NOTHING of note with his life before or after being elected to political office, including the present position.
3696	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	He was a do nothing state rep. A do nothing Federal Senator, and now a do nothing [good] president.
3697	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	But he came from nowhere in 2008 in a political vacuum.
3698	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	And now timing blesses him again with unusually low inflation.
3699	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Notice that no lib.
3700	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	is blaming Bush for that.
3701	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	Inflation is very low, artificially low.
3702	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	If we were running even normal inflation rates, calls for impeachment would already have been heard.
3703	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	BO's failed economic policy does not show up as bad as they are, due to very low inflation.BHO has had more political luck and blessing than any politician in the last 100 years.

3705	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1207	He has wasted every bit of it.
3706	Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1208	And how does any of this relate to your claim that &quot;redistribution of wealth&quot; and &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need&quot; is the same?
3707	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1209	I don't recall endorsing communism.

3709	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1210	Everybody knows that.
3710	Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1211	Again, how is this relevant to anything?
3711	Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1211	Throwing out random bits of nonsense won't get you anywhere.
3712	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	Random bits of nonsense?
3713	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	I cannot argue with an expert in that field.
3714	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	And all liberals are experts at random bits of nonsense.
3715	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	But the pendulum is swinging away from the utter nonsense of liberalism and back to the logic of conservatism.
3716	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	It will take a few more years but your day in the sun is ending.
3717	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	Once again actual accomplishments will be rewarded and there will be no more rewards for being a parasite on society.
3718	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1212	If one's accomplishments are meager, so then will their rewards be equally meager.
3719	Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1213	Using fallacious arguments over and over and over again wouldn't exactly ensure that you are above using nonsense, and arrogantly trying to portray that I do as such, even though, out of the two of us, I'm the only one even attempting to further discuss the topic at hand.
3720	Agent Zero	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1213	I'm terribly sorry that you can't manage to support your own position, but it's no reason to be unnecessarily antagonistic.
3721	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	The reality of the country around us supports my position perfectly and completely negates yours.
3722	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	I have no need to prove the obvious while you have no possibility of disproving the ridiculousness of liberalism.It is what it is. Liberals have had their run most all of the 20th Century.
3723	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	It didn't work.
3724	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	Your time is gone.
3725	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	The transition will take a bit but it is time for liberals to fade into the background.
3726	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	Sadly at some time in the future, the pendulum will swing back your way.
3727	Dan40	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1214	I'll be gone.

3732	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1217	Oh wait it's not.
3733	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1217	You are TAKING from one to give something to another that did nothing.
3734	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	Yeah like Clinton's mythical Budget surplus that every Democrat never fails to mention.What they do not mention is that Clinton COOPERATED with a Republican Congress to come close to balancing the budget.
3735	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	And that in no fiscal year of Clinton's Presidency did the national debt come down.
3736	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	It went up every year!
3737	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	Altho in small amounts that we would love to have today.
3738	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	But spending was NEVER so controlled that the interest on the debt did not cause the debt to increase.
3739	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	Interest IS part of the problem and must be counted same as reckless spending.
3740	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	But again kudos to Clinton and the Republicans for as well as they did.
3741	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1218	We could use that cooperation today.Just one small example of true history that Dems and libs seem to get wrong constantly.
3742	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1219	You're being charged to live in one of the greatest countries in America.
3743	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1219	It's the only way to pay for such freedom that's fair.
3744	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1220	And how much are the Takers being charged and by whom.HALF of our &quot;greatest country&quot; GETS while the other half GIVES.
3745	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1220	And you profess that is Right???
3746	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	Part of living in this great country means if the proper channels are filed no one should ever starve in this country.
3747	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	You might be giving right now.
3748	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	But if God forbid you fall into a situation where you can't afford food any longer you will be thankful to be in a country where you can get tax assistance as well.I'm sorry you'd rather live in a country where we allow people to starve because of their financial situation.
3749	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	But thankfully we are a land of freedom.
3750	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1221	Not greed.
3751	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	As always the liberal Utopian dreams sound beautiful, but they DO NOT stand up to reality.
3752	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	HALF this country ARE parasites living QUITE WELL off the half that are responsible hard working citizens.
3753	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	And of the half that are parasites, LESS THAN 10&#37; approach anything that could be called REAL poverty.
3754	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	And only a tiny percentage EVER go to bed HUNGRY.
3755	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	Most are over nourished on junk food and grossly FAT!
3756	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	Starving is nearly NON-EXISTENT in this country.
3757	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	Freeloading is a life career for half the country.
3758	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1222	THAT, is the reason I object.
3759	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1223	Really?
3760	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1223	So you being on food stamps or a bridge card (I forget which one you are on), while I work 2 jobs to pay for my college, etc... is ok, while you don't have a job.
3761	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1223	How is this fair again?
3762	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	It's fair because A. I'm probably in a lot more debt.
3763	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	And B. You can probably afford more things.
3764	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	And C. If the bridge card didn't exist I can all but guarantee you would not have your 2 jobs right now in this economy.
3765	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	And if you did it would be for a lot less money.
3766	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	And D. Even someone working 2 jobs could get a bridge card if they wanted to and they make less than the required money.
3767	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1224	I suggest you stop whining and apply.

3771	Antix	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1225	1) Said he was against the middle eastern war, said that he would start pulling troops out at the beginning, instead he sent more than bush did (FACT).
3772	Antix	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1225	He said he was against The Patriot act but voted for it.2) In his healthcare bill, he used backdoor meetings to secure votes by unions etc..
3773	Antix	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1225	The bill itself was changed multiple times before republicans could properly read it, and democrats as well.3) Is going to let Bush tax cuts expire, which is going to increase taxes.
3774	Antix	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1225	His administration has announced tax increases due to the healthcare bill, and thats for everyone.
3775	Antix	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1225	They are purposing to add a VAT tax while not eliminating any others (Thats an increase of taxes).4) He has spent more money in 2 years than bush did in 8.5) Used his the position of his politicl party to strong arm obama care through before most congress had even read it, before any of the american people had read it and despite the strong resistance from the entire country.6) Instead of supporting our country's sovereignty, he choses to sue the state that takes matters that the federal government is obligated to do as the federal government.etc..Bottom line, there is someone WAY better out there, it doesnt matter if its only 2 years in, there is someone WAY better.
3776	Antix	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1228	So how is your decision to make debt for yourself a defense?
3777	TheTaoOfBill	Antix	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1229	You think it's my choice to be in more debt?

3906	Saxon Caucasus	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1252	It is a more severe downturn than a recession, which is seen by economists as part of a normal business cycle.Considered a rare and extreme form of recession, a depression is characterized by its length, and by abnormally large increases in unemployment, falls in the availability of credit— quite often due to some kind of banking/financial crisis, shrinking output and investment, numerous bankruptcies— including sovereign debt defaults, significantly reduced amounts of trade and commerce— especially international, as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations— most often due to devaluations.

We all just make up our minds before hand and never change any of our opinions... we also do not know how to not have an opinion and we know who we will vote for 2 years in advance.

4015	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1289	Well that is what will happen.

4019	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1289	One, they lay off people or the raise the prices that the middle class has to pay for their products or services,---OR BOTH.

4022	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1289	And the rich, vested or working, are pound for pound about 5 or 6 times smarter than politicians.

4030	mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1290	The more reforms the Democrats enact, the less happy independent voters – who, presumably, voted for Democrats because they wanted many of these reforms enacted – are.If this discontent produces the sort of &quot;enthusiasm gap&quot; at the elections hinted at in many recent polls, November could indeed see significant gains for the GOP.That said, my guess is the gains won't be quite as large as many pundits think, that the much-anticipated rout won't actually occur.
4031	mertex	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1290	There are signs, in recent polls, that as the election nears and more people start paying attention to the debates, voters are starting to return to the Democrats.

4097	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1325	But the fact is we still went further in debt.
4098	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1325	The President along with the Republican Congress did a great job.

4101	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1326	The debt is how much has been cumulatively borrowed for any given point in time; a budget surplus or deficit measures revenues and expenditures for a given period, normally a fiscal year.

4104	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1327	The fiscal year of the US Govt is 9/30 to 9/30.
4105	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1327	What the number is on Mar 19, or Dec 31 means nothing because the books are simply open on those days.
4106	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1327	When the books are closed for the year [9/30] then we have the number.Second your link to the CBO shows that Clinton's first few years of spending, UNTIL he got SADDLED with a Republican Congress, was larger than Bush's first few years.
4107	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1327	In actual dollars not adjusted for inflation.And it shows as I have claimed that the receipts under Bush, before and after, the tax cuts EXCEEDED any, and ALL years of Clinton.And it shows that as a &#37; of GDP, Debt was higher in EVERY year of Clinton than it was in any year of Bush.And evidently the CBO, who is not responsible for PAYING any bills, just crunching numbers, does not count the ever mounting interest, that Treasury does when they have to pay bills with phantom surpluses.You do Bill Clinton a disservice by claiming he made a surplus.

4109	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1327	Clinton got handed an opposing Congress.

4181	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1349	It is only the latter that is referred to as the &quot;General Welfare Clause&quot; of this document.
4182	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1349	However, it has been argued that, in the case of the United States Constitution, the statement regarding the &quot;general welfare&quot; was not then and is not now intended to give plenary power to the federal government.[2] These clauses in the U.S. Constitution are exceptions to the typical use of a general welfare clause, and are not considered grants of a general legislative power to the federal government as the U.S. Supreme Court has held: * the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution &quot;has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on the Government of the United States or on any of its Departments&quot;;[3][4] and, * that Associate Justice Joseph Story's construction of the Article I, Section 8 General Welfare Clause—as elaborated in Story's 1833 Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States—was the correct interpretation.[5][6] Justice Story concluded that the General Welfare Clause was not an independent grant of power, but a qualification on the taxing power which included within it a power to spend tax revenues on matters of general interest to the federal government.Thomas Jefferson explained the latter general welfare clause for the United States: “[T]he laying of taxes is the power, and the general welfare the purpose for which the power is to be exercised.
4183	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1349	They [Congress] are not to lay taxes ad libitum for any purpose they please; but only to pay the debts or provide for the welfare of the Union.
4184	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1349	In like manner, they are not to do anything they please to provide for the general welfare, but only to lay taxes for that purpose.”[7]In 1824 Chief Justice John Marshall described in obiter dictum a further limit on the General Welfare Clause in Gibbons v. Ogden: &quot;Congress is authorized to lay and collect taxes, &amp;c. to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States.

4404	RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	I have no problems with the Islam or Muslims or any other religion including those that have a lack of religion.

4406	RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	And as a preacher church owner, and non profit Christian humanitarian mission owner I do not tolerate or will not be around my Christian brothers and sisters that hate for the same reasons as above.

4408	RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	If the supporters and those doing the funding (no one knows who is funding the Mosque as of Aug 1 2010) etc would build somewhere else I would be willing to bet that a conservative group would donate land to build it on as a reciprocal gesture of good faith.
4409	RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	It's just a guess but I know my conservatives.
4410	RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	(I lean towards the conservative side mostly because of my religion).
4411	RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Nevertheless, If they go ahead with plans to build the mosque it will be a very dangerous place to be and it will breed seething, venomous anger all the way round'.
4412	RevAnarchist	Mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	The Mosque supporters certainly have the right to build it, but what a gesture it would be if they decided to move it!
4413	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	As a devout Christian I too think that is wrong.
4414	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Maybe he meant radical Muslims?
4415	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Moderate Islam is a beautiful religion that fairly mirrors Christianity right up to where Abraham almost sacrifices his son.
4416	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	My surgeon of five years is a devout Muslim, and she is beautiful I must say!

4418	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Yes, but that is the point, There are too many coincidences for there not to be something malicious going on.
4419	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	I was somewhat against the mosque before I found out that it would be dedicated on the anniversary of 9/11!
4420	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	That was what turned me against it, Then I researched where the funding originated and the Cordoba group etc. More bad feelings!
4421	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	I feel the true intent is not good.
4422	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	I also feel that the good Muslims that support the Mosque as well as secular liberals etc have been fooled by this malicious element into believing that the intent and the purpose of the projected mosque is benign and meant to foster good will etc. .
4423	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Can you clarify and expand on that?
4424	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	What is wrong with the right-wing, GOP, Tea Party ideology?
4425	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Personally being an Anarchist (I would like to rearrange the USA completely) but a registered independent I feel that the right-wing, GOP, Tea Party will save our country from sure total destruction by well meaning liberals.
4426	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	They are led by a malicious element who thinks we can spend our way out of this recession.
4427	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Yes the malicious element is none other than Obama!
4428	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	He insists on socializing our country, which is another sure way to break the bank.
4429	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	He seems hell bent to do every thing to ruin this shaky recovery (and a jobless one at that).
4430	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	And I think he has plans for making the USA fully socialist.
4431	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Then there is the fact that this administration thinks we can appease the Taliban types or the Ben Laden style terrorists who are the freedom fighters of major Islamic world powers.
4432	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	These states want to destroy Israel and the USA ASAP.
4433	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	The terrorist sponsoring nations and oil rich citizens fund &amp; give aid and support to all anti christian anti secular western terrorists and the Islamic militants.
4434	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	Their stated primary goal is to convert or kill all of us including our children and everyone that does not convert to Islam.Its time to give the militarized radical Islamic terrorists an offer they should not and ultimately can not refuse.
4435	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	It should he fair offer.
4436	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1402	However, we should then take a zero tolerance policy with regards to terror and began isolating the entire western hemisphere militarily industrially economically scientifically with emphasis on pure R&amp;D.ra
4437	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	Your misconceptions, misunderstandings, and outright FEAR of the tea party make your posts about them laughable.
4438	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	NO ONE at any tea party I've attended would ever think of bringing Bush back even if it was possible.
4439	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	The near instantaneous growth of the tea party after the elections was because we all thought we could put the calamity of the Bush years behind us and get on with repairing the nation.
4440	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	Instead we were presented with an even more incompetent idiot clown without ANY clue of what the Presidency means or how to even begin doing the job.
4441	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	And now approaching 2 years later, he shows on a daily basis that he is in fact a clown that history will find hilarious, but not for many, many years.The good news is that he has started another vacation.
4442	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	This time on Martha's Vineyard for 10 days.
4443	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	Did they get unpacked from the last one?
4444	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	But when he's on vacation, he's doing less damage to the nation.
4445	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	Failure on a daily basis must be so extremely exhausting that he needs constant vacations.
4446	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1403	When the liberals lose control of Congress in Nov. he will need overlapping vacations from then on.
4447	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Are you claiming that the Muslims that are trying to convert that Wal-mart building into a community center are radical Muslims?
4448	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense - why you would associate them with the Al Qaeda that is responsible for 9/11.
4449	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	It would be understandable if they were, that they would not be a welcome sight anywhere near Ground Zero.
4450	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I have no doubt that there would be some Christian (wealthy person) that would be more than generous and would donate the land, but most of the ones complaining are more interested in just denying these people their Constitutional right and have created this &quot;sensitivity&quot; bs, since the building is not even that close to Ground Zero.
4451	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I realize that, but conservatives do less that resembles what Christ would want them to do when it comes to politics, that I wonder why so many believe they are doing what Christ would want them to do.
4452	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I wonder if Christians were the ones building a church and the Muslims were complaining, if the Christians would be as willing to move or would they do what so many of them do, and become violent and hateful.
4453	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Like when they are told to remove a statue of the 10 Commandments out of a government building - and they go against all the laws?
4454	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	If these Muslims are willing to build somewhere else, that would be great, but I cannot see where we can disregard what the Constitution guarantees just to placate people's sensitivities.
4455	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Christians have to be sensitive to the feelings of others, too.
4456	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	She was attributing the long waits at the airports and other changes we have had to get used to, due to the horrible crime committed on 9/11 by some Islamic terrorists, but they do not make up the total Islam religion, so it is wrong to condemn all of them for what some extremists of their religion are doing.

4458	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	We are willing to sacrifice our lives to provide them with a democracy but start whining at their building a mosque, or a community center?
4459	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	You tell me where that makes any sense.
4460	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Unfortunately, most of the ones protesting the community center claim that they don't have anything against Muslims, but if you are not able to distinguish between those that were responsible for 9/11 and those who lost loved ones on 9/11, and want to build something that would be good, the claim becomes blurred.
4461	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	I just read an article where the leaders of the planned community center have decided against building it there.
4462	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	It would seem to me that if they had a malicious agenda they would not have given up.
4463	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	However, how do you feel about this:The New York Republican party is also said to be planning a hostile television campaign.Doesn't sound like a bunch of Christians to me.
4464	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	What evil could they possible be planning?
4465	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	If they are really such evil motivated people, again, why do most Republicans/conservatives defend the Iraq war?
4466	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Now you have gone and called these Muslims ignorant.
4467	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	That they would not be able to figure out that they are being manipulated, sounds a little condescending and something that I find alarming coming from someone that calls himself a Christian.
4468	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	As if, those that oppose the Mosque are the only ones blessed with the ability to see beyond the obvious, and know what is in people's hearts.
4469	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	There are other mosques in the area, and also bars.
4470	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	So, why does this one hold &quot;special&quot; powers?
4471	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	On Sunday, Jon Kyl (R-AZ) went on “Face the Nation” and suggested, that with all the anchor babies running around, it might be time to scrap the 14th Amendment.Now, the Senate Minority Leader agrees.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is the latest high-profile Republican to say Congress should reconsider the guarantee of birthright citizenship provided by the 14th Amendment, in light of the current debate over immigration reform.http://firedoglake.com/2010/08/03/re...-brown-people/

4473	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	And all I know of their ideology is &quot;tax cuts for the wealthy&quot;!
4474	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Pardon the expression but that is a bunch of crap.
4475	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	That is the same rhetoric that Rush Limbaugh and the rest of the wealthy Republicans are saying because they want to keep their tax cuts.
4476	mertex	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1404	Wow!

4482	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	The developers are within their rights to build it.

4484	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	But having the right does not make building it right!

4495	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	it’s different than what you believe, but maybe we can at least understand each others beliefs.
4496	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I am guilty of calling Obama a few names out of anger and fear and agree its not anything to be proud of, but I do not think it’s a terribly bad sin.

4499	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I am surprised that you think the 3000 families of the dead and double that number wounded would be lying about the harm this thing is going to do.
4500	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	That saddens me that you would think that especially after you are so adamant about offending Obama by calling him names etc. Think about it.
4501	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	3000 families that’s at least six to nine thousand people not to mention the survivors of the other attacks.

4504	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	What by protesting the mosque?
4505	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I agree that some liberal politics are more in line with Jesus teachings, but I would not fear Jesus if I were in a peaceful protest march when he came back.
4506	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I believe the developers of the mosque has hidden motives for building the mosque too.
4507	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I will be interested in seeing where the funding is coming from.

4511	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	With all due respect, you seem less and less like a Christian the more you talk.
4512	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	The ten commandants plaques are tradition in most cases.

4514	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	In most cases it’s the attitude of activist atheists that make Christians bow up.
4515	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	In every case I have seen these atheists want to harm or destroy Christianity by forcing ends to long held traditions.
4516	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	In many cases they want to harm us not to improve anything.

4524	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	There is some ignorance out there, however most traditional christians do not hate all Muslims, just the radicalized terrorists that want to impose their religion on us or murder us.

4526	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I gave several reasons and I am researching this mosque hoping to run down the funding.
4527	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	What would you say if Islamic terrorists were funding part of the Mosque?
4528	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	You are rather insensitive.

4532	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	It depends on how hostile the program is I suppose.
4533	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	Its all bad stuff.
4534	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I fear that the thing will get blown up or after its built something will happen.
4535	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1406	I just wish they would not put themselves and the city full of people in harms way and build somewhere else.

4556	RevAnarchist	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1407	Because its being dedicated on 9/11 being built on nearly on top if not on top of the remains of victims, because the funding is hidden and they will not reveal it, because of the name of the center.

4575	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1411	Not the complete round, but just the bullet itself.If so, you haven't any clue about weapons at all, and are simply a child trolling on this site.
4576	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1411	The only differences in the bullets are, different diameters, different lengths, different weights, different shapes, and cannot be fired from the same gun, either .45, or .50.
4577	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1411	The similarities are that they are both called bullets.

4580	mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	That is what doesn't make any sense.Conservatives cheer and whoop it up that 4000+ soldiers have given their lives to give Muslims in Iraq a democracy and then whine, (*)(*)(*)(*)(*) and revolt over Muslims building a community center.
4581	mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	So, you blame all &quot;Muslims&quot; for what 19 Al-Qaeda terrorists did?
4582	mertex	BigBob	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1412	That figures.

4588	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	The fact that you ignore all the antics of the Tea Party, the crazy whacko's like Sharon Angle and her off the wall suggestions, the rantings of Palin and Michelle Bachmann and claim that the Tea Party is somehow the answer to America's problems is what is truly laughable.
4589	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	The way they bow at the knee at the mention of his name would make one wonder.

4591	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	The near instantaneous growth of the tea party after the elections was because of the &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;anger&quot; that a &quot;black&quot; man was now at the helm.
4592	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	And the instantaneous support geared at Palin (Tea Party fave), is another indication that the Tea Party is not really interested in people who exercise frugality to reflect their conservatism, but rather in someone that uses catchy phrases, made-up words and does not practice conservatism in their own life.
4593	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	Your rantings are truly comical.

4595	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	That is the dream of right-wing fanatics of Bush, because they would love for someone to replace that Bozo in the &quot;worst President&quot; category, unfortunately, it doesn't look like it is going to happen.
4596	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	Already, Obama has been given accolades that Bush doesn't even know how to pronounce.Obama 15th Greatest President
4597	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	Funny that you should mention that, being that Bozobush is known for having taken the most time off than any other president.Vacationing Bush Sets Record on Time Off
4598	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	That would have been Bush, Obama's staff continues to work when he is on vacation.
4599	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1413	It is the constant sniping and whining from the &quot;right&quot; that wears on him, but he is resilient enough to withstand all that vitriol.

4601	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1414	He is showing wear because he is deeply lost.
4602	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1414	In way over his head.
4603	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1414	He's so far out of his capability that he doesn't even realize it, and is confused that nothing works.
4604	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1414	And nothing works because the top, oBum, doesn't know what he is doing.
4605	Dan40	mertex	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1414	And his gang of YES MEN thugs only know Chicago payola and threats politics.

4607	mertex	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1415	Another person that doesn't know the conventional way of posting!Grrr!You've been listening to Faux News too long.

4968	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1498	So the truly awful Republicans [no disagreement there] were replaced by the Democrats who HAVE DONE WORSE!

4977	GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	because when we had a surplus G.W. cut taxes, increased spending, and took a machete to regulations.
4978	GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	When Obama took office right after the http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=IE&amp;h...&amp;v=mEkY7_i7MJs.
4979	GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	Now, instead of raising taxes when we had a surplus and the economy was good, it was thrown away, dribbled into haliburton and the banks.
4980	GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	Because the Bush tax cut for the rich expired 1.4 years into Obama's term, it was meant to make him look like he was raising taxes in a time in recession when in fact it was just a ploy to make the democratic president, whoever it was look bad, because even Bush knew after the havic he knew he'd create no republican would take office after him.
4981	GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	So is Obama perfect?
4982	GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	no. Was he dealt a bad hand?
4983	GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	yes, he had no where but down to go, and without spending for stimulous we'd keep going down.
4984	GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	Is Obama doing what truly needs to be done to fix our broken system of government feeding the rich who gamle our money away?
4985	GodfatherN1	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1500	no, but honestly I think republicans would be even worse, historically speaking than the man in office now.

4991	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1501	Not even Osama bin Laden would finance that group of rattlesnakes (Don't tread on me!) and he has incentive to do so since electing them is the same as electing him.
4992	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1501	Sorry, that dog won't hunt!Seriously, if the Republicans could muster a &quot;real&quot; American candidate, as an Independent, I might vote for him/her.

4997	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1501	Now, all they can do is hobble around on crutches blaming Obama for their inability to run the marathon without tea party help.
4998	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1501	Ohhhhhhhh, the pain of it all!

5002	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1502	It is a groundswell movement of many DIVERSE groups with only a few things in common with one another.
5003	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1502	Out of Control Govt spending and the National Debt would be 2 complaints that most tea party groups have in common.
5004	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1502	How to fix those things and many, many others are points of disagreement in the various tea parties, same as they are in society in general.
5005	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1502	Now some have used the name Tea Party for their own political purposes and gain.

5058	onalandline	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1524	The only cuts that would be allowed to expire as scheduled would be those on people making $250,000 per year or more, or roughly 2 percent of taxpayers.TPM has the exchange, from &quot;Face the Nation&quot;:Bob Schieffer: &quot;I want to make sure I heard what you said correctly: you're saying that you are willing to vote for those middle class tax cuts, even though the bill will not include ... extending the tax cuts for the upper bracket American.&quot; Rep. Boehner: &quot;Bob, we don't know what the bill's going to say, alright?

Joe Courtney, for example) have lately sounded resigned to the likelihood that they will have to vote to extend all the cuts, even on the rich, since doing nothing would result in hiking taxes on the middle class.
5061	onalandline	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1524	And since Republicans, by simply folding their arms and saying no to anything but the full slate of tax cuts, would force Democrats to choose between extending a boon for multimillionaires or delivering nothing and handing their opponents another club to use in the fall campaigns.Why would Boehner blink?Perhaps because, as with so many other issues in the last year, the Senate will carry the day.Today, here's Sen. Joe Lieberman, a registered Democrat who makes a lot of registered Democrats see red, explaining that he'll be holding out for the same thing Boehner is: extending the cuts for everybody.More: http://www.theday.com/article/201009...0403/100919940

5132	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1540	Since the private sector already has to pay every cent of that $121,000.
5133	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1540	Federal largess.

5144	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1543	There isn't one (*)(*)(*)(*) conservative politician today who is saying where they're going to cut $500 billion in spending.
5145	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1543	In the meantime keep those tax cuts and keep running up debt.All that conservative whining about deficits is nothing but hypocritical political horse(*)(*)(*)(*).
5146	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1544	Says someone who is on food stamps/bridge card.
5147	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1544	Why don't YOU pay YOUR bills instead of having someone else pay for them.
5148	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1544	I find it comical you are (*)(*)(*)(*)(*)ing about others paying their bills when you don't even pay yours.
5149	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1544	Typical liberal college kid.

5152	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1545	Otherwise I wouldn't be able to afford to bring business to my local brewery.
5153	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1545	Food stamps help the economy.
5154	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1546	So you are worried about buying beer?
5155	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1546	wow.
5156	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1546	Receiving food stamps is not paying your bills.
5157	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1546	Somebody else (the taxpayer) is. You should be thanking the taxpayer.

5159	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1547	By funding the food stamps program you help me not only afford to eat but use my money elsewhere to support small local businesses.
5160	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1547	Which include breweries and video game stores.

5163	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1548	AND there isn't one liberal politician that doesn't want to increase taxes ON EVERYONE and increase spending on everything.Don't you ever notice my signature?We have to get the politicians out of politics.
5164	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1548	Term limits are NECESSARY for the survival of the country.
5165	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1548	POLITICIANS of both parties got us where we are.
5166	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1548	We need the constant change of real people to get us out.
5167	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1549	Change isn't always good.
5168	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1549	The change we took in 2000 was a disaster.
5169	Eighty Deuce	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1550	And then we went from bad to worse in 2008.
5170	Eighty Deuce	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1550	That is also what is currently on the plate.
5171	Eighty Deuce	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1550	Blame Bush ain't working out so well anymore for the one-trick-pony dopes, now is it.
5172	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1551	2000 was bad, but only a warm up to the total disaster of 2008.
5173	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1552	Yup, I noticed that too.
5174	Iriemon	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1554	Bush was president in 2008.
5175	Iriemon	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1554	I agree it went from bad to worse.Things started turning around in 2009.
5176	Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1555	Yup, I noticed that too.
5177	Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1555	Obama was elected in 2008, not 2000.Check your history books.
5178	bacardi	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1556	but the stimulus is wearing out and soon the economy and the stock markets will both be heading south!
5179	Iriemon	bacardi	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1557	Sure thing.
5180	Iriemon	bacardi	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1557	When's &quot;soon&quot;?
5181	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1558	Your assumptions are incorrect.
5182	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1558	I was commenting on and agreeing with your first sentence, not your second.
5183	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1558	A hint could be found in my quoting your first sentence, not your second.
5184	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1559	No.
5185	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1559	You are spending someone else's money on needs.
5186	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1559	You are spending your own money on things you don't need (wants).
5187	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1559	You are justifying taking someone else's money so you can buy beer and video games, classic liberal.
5188	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Yes.
5189	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	I am justifying getting food stamps so I can afford to buy things other than just food.
5190	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	As such I am helping the economy more than I would be if I wasn't on food stamps and only spending money on food.
5191	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	I have great pride in my decision to get food stamps because I am helping America get back on track.
5192	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	If more of our nation's poor took advantage of government assistance programs designed specifically for them then then even more businesses would benefit.
5193	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Demand would go up.
5194	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	And businesses would be forced to expand to make up for the new demand.
5195	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Which means more jobs which ultimately means less people dependent on food stamps.Food stamps also allows me to be independent from my parents.
5196	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Who can't afford to take care of me. Which means they too can spend money on things like paying off their mortgage so they don't become another foreclosure statistic.
5197	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1560	Thank god food stamps exist so that people like me who struggle with academics and require lots of time studying can afford to go to school and eat at the same time.
5198	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1561	What total rationalizing bullcrap, You are doing NOTHING for the economy.
5199	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1561	The money you're using to buy things &quot;other than food&quot; is not doing anything extra for the economy.
5200	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1561	Because someone earned that money AND the right to spend it as they wished, but it was taken from them in the form of taxes to buy food stamps for you.As my signature says, 2 people spending one person's money DOES NOT help the economy.
5201	bacardi	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1564	I quoted the wrong post LOLYou are sounding like the non-believers that thought the housing bubble would go on forever!
5202	shaker154	bacardi	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1565	true but mass hysteria also creates crises and positive people live longer anyway... they just don't have as much money...
5203	CommonSense184	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1566	Instead of taking food stamps and then spending your time surfing the web explaining how in a round about way you are helping the economy, you could simply go out and get a job.
5204	CommonSense184	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1566	My parents said they couldn't afford to keep me under their roof forever, so I decided to go to college so I could get a job and MAKE MY OWN MONEY.
5205	CommonSense184	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1566	There is no way you can say that getting a job and then spending the money from that job is not helping the economy.
5206	Iriemon	bacardi	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1568	Not at all.
5207	Iriemon	bacardi	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1568	I had opportunities by buy real estate in the 2005-07 time frame and wouldn't touch it.You are sounding like the non-believers that think the gold bubble will go on forever!
5208	TheTaoOfBill	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1569	Food stamps wouldn't exist if it didn't benefit businesses.
5209	TheTaoOfBill	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1569	That's the whole reason we still have food stamps.
5210	TheTaoOfBill	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1569	To allow our poor to spend money on things they wouldn't be able to afford otherwise at minimal cost to businesses.
5211	TheTaoOfBill	Eighty Deuce	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1569	I am indeed helping the economy
5212	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	I'm glad you could handle a full time job and full time school at the same time.
5213	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	I cannot.
5214	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	When I tried my GPA plummeted.
5215	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	A job at some fast food place isn't as important to me as getting through college.
5216	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	So I choose not to work.
5217	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	Just like plenty of other college students.
5218	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	And there is nothing wrong with it.
5219	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	The government will be taking way more in taxes from me after I graduate than the amount I get in food stamps.Also I would not be able to get through college without this assistance.
5220	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	Which means I wouldn't be able to make the high salary I plan to achieve after I graduate.
5221	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	Which means the government would be missing out on hundreds of thousands of tax dollars during my career.
5222	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	So yes.
5223	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	on many factors getting food stamps is helping the economy.
5224	TheTaoOfBill	CommonSense184	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1570	Not only the business end but it is helping it to gain more revenue in the future.
5225	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1571	And thanks to those food stamps I can afford to go to college to get a high salary job which will have high taxes which will be used to pay for some other college kid's food stamps.
5226	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1571	It's an economic fact that more money is pumped into the economy thanks to food stamps than the program itself costs.
5227	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1571	That's why there isn't a politician in their right mind suggesting we get rid of it.
5228	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1571	Only conservatives who don't understand how economics work.
5229	Taxpayer	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1573	A lot of truth in that.
5230	Taxpayer	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1573	Like most things, it's a matter of incentives.
5231	Taxpayer	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1573	Politicians have an incentive to give people what they want and American's consistently want more than they can afford.
5232	Taxpayer	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1573	As long as politicians are allowed to borrow money, the inevitable result is short term patches, snowballing debt, and an eventual crash.
5233	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	You really think those tax dollars &quot;pumped into&quot; the economy wouldn't have been spent had the government not forcibly taken them from people in order to give you the privilege of spending someone else's money?
5234	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	The reason politicians don't shut down this type of forced charity is not because of some greater economic good, it's because more voters want a free ride than are being abused by our tax system.
5235	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	They keep it going to get votes, stay in office, and collect an unearned paycheck.
5236	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	You can, but odds are you won't.
5237	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1574	The fact that the height of your ambition is to get a salary rather than trying to really make an impact on the economy suggests you'll never pay enough in taxes to even equal what you take out of the government much less help someone else.
5238	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	An economic fact that more money is pumped into the economy thanks to food stamps, than the program costs.
5239	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	That is not only a blatant lie, it is also impossible.
5240	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	It cannot pump anything IN after the same program took the money OUT of the economy.
5241	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	Believe the liberal bullsh!t if you wish or make up nonsense as you go along.
5242	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	I went to college working 2 jobs, 1 full time, 1 part time.
5243	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	AND had a wife and 2 kids.
5244	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	No food stamps, no welfare, we provided our own help.

5246	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1575	But I'm guessing you don't really know anything about that.
5247	jthorp24	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1576	He doesn't.
5248	jthorp24	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1576	IF money were truly that big of an issue to him he would go to a much cheaper college and save money.
5249	jthorp24	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1576	I'm tired of this liberal bullsh!t that &quot;I can't work because I need time to study.&quot; That's a bunch of non-sense.
5250	jthorp24	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1576	There is always plenty of time to study.
5251	jthorp24	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1576	Also, once you get a job and go to school, you find ways to better manage your time I have realized.
5252	jthorp24	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1576	But, of course, he needs money for video games
5253	Dan40	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1577	Back in those days there were times when I was dead dog tired.
5254	Dan40	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1577	I had 2 sayings that I would repeat in my head.
5255	Dan40	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1577	One from my Dad, &quot;The more you carry in your head, the less you'll have to carry on your back.&quot; And one of my own, &quot;The more you do, the more you can do.&quot;And with age, I've found that the opposite of mine is also true, &quot;The more you sit, the more you have to sit.&quot;
5256	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	No.
5257	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	You're wrong.
5258	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Food stamps do benefit the economy.
5259	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	This is an economic fact.http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/29/news...ysis/index.htmhttp://www2.hickoryrecord.com/news/2...nomy-ar-89482/http://www.stateline.org/live/detail...ntentId=401013It is a general trend of capitalism for money to get stuck in high income families.
5260	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Wealth just moves it's way up and once it gets there it does not come back down.
5261	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Wealthy business owners only spend enough to make more money.
5262	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	They do not hire just because they have extra money lying around.
5263	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Because if they did that they might lose money if they are more productive than their demand warrants.
5264	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	So the money gets put in a bank.
5265	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Or an inheritance fund.
5266	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Or some other place where it just sits and makes more money on interest or dividends.
5267	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Sure some of it might &quot;trickle down&quot; but it goes up many times faster than it comes down.The income tax was designed from the start to balance this issue out.
5268	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	It was designed to take money from those who aren't spending it and are instead hording it to make more money for themselves.That money then goes to programs to assist lower income families.
5269	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Whether through food, education, healthcare, or just putting a little extra money in their pockets.This in turn creates more consumers, which means more demand, which forces employers to hire more, which makes businesses sell more product.It's a delicate economic system that ensures everyone gets a piece of the pie.
5270	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Some might get bigger pieces but at least everyone is eating pie.
5271	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	This system keeps our economy healthy.
5272	TheTaoOfBill	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1578	Taking those taxes away only insures the rich get richer and the poor gets poorer.
5273	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	I'm glad you could.
5274	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	You're a better man than me. I had two choices.
5275	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	Work a job and still make barely enough to feed myself while watching my GPA drop below 2.5... or focus all my efforts on school get on government assistance and watch my GPA go to 3.3.Sorry.
5276	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	The choice is clear.
5277	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	3.3 is a way nicer GPA.
5278	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	And I'm not going to sacrifice that so I can make minimum wage when I'm doing just fine living off food stamps and loans.
5279	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	It means I'll be in more debt when I get out of school.
5280	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1579	But I'll have an easier time finding a job because of my GPA and the fact that I had time to be the president of a student organization.
5281	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1580	I went to community college for 2 years to get all my gen eds out of the way for basically free (state paid my way).
5282	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1580	And I am currently enrolled in one of the cheapest 4 year universities in the state.
5283	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1581	And Bush and oBum both have spent like drunken idiots and the economy is in perfect shape for all their Govt spending.
5284	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1581	Liberals are lunatics that think something can be made from nothing.

5286	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1583	The continuing high unemployment.
5287	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1583	The continuing avoidance of the real issues.

5295	REDRUM	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1585	ROFLMAO!
5296	REDRUM	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1585	When Bush left office in January of 2009, the nation wide unemployment was 7.2 percent and the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the USA was about $1.65.
5297	REDRUM	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1585	After Spender-N-Chief Obama took the oath of office the nation wide unemployment peaked over 10 percent in October not to mention the fact that 2+ million jobs lost under a Blueneck President.
5298	REDRUM	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1585	President Obama: Chains we can believe in!
5299	Iriemon	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1586	When Bush left office the economy was tanking at -7% real rate and a net 700,000 jobs were being lost each month.Only our conservative friends could find that hilarious.
5300	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	One of the most perverse assertions I've ever heard, too often repeated by those who are unable to earn the lifestyle they demand.More accurately, wealth moves from those that consume much and produce little to those that consume less less than they produce.
5301	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	This isn't a flaw in capitalism, it isn't about money getting &quot;stuck.&quot; It happens because some participants in our economy provide insufficient value to earn money but feel they have a right to spend it.
5302	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	Arbitrarily taking wealth from those who deliver value and gifting it to those who don't doesn't balance out some inherent flaw in capitalism, it masks and excuses the actual failure.
5303	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	The failure isn't that some citizens are &quot;hording&quot; dollars, it's that others are failing to provide anything worth the dollars they covet.If you truly think our economy is best served by maximizing consumption at the expense of productivity, explore the extreme of your theory.
5304	Taxpayer	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1587	If all wealth was collected weekly under a single tax and then evenly redistributed -- how would our economy fair?
5305	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1589	Did the Democratic National Committee take a poll?
5306	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1589	Because NO INDEPENDENT polls are saying anything like that.

5308	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	Obama took office, and the economy was in free fall.
5309	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	The reason we got 10&#37; unemployment has absolutely nothing to do with Barrack Obama.
5310	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	As I said, the economy was already in free fall.
5311	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	But that was not only bush's fault.
5312	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	It was a culmination of 30 years of bad economic policy beginning with Ronald Reagan, continuing through HW Bush and Clinton, and ultimately ending in Bush's administration.
5313	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	Poor policy enacted by the federal reserve also played a major role.
5314	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	So if you truly believe Obama had anything to do with causing unemployment to go to 10% you are delusional and so incredibly partisan that it is a waste of my time to even write this post.
5315	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	But if you are capable of thinking critically, you will realize that is nonsense, and try to actually evaluate policy independently and intelligently.
5316	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	Then if you wanted to blame Obama for the fact that the economy has not recovered more quickly(he could certainly have done more), or the fact that he reformed health care without actually making health care more affordable and accessible for the average person, or that he has failed to competently regulate the banks, etc then I would say you certainly have a point.
5317	frodly	REDRUM	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1591	But if you want to blame Obama for a recession that was already happening before he took office, you are going to have to be incredibly dishonest.
5318	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1592	Newsweek poll August 25- 47% of voters approved of how President Obama is handling his job, 45% of voters disapproved.

5320	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1593	And Newsweek is a left wing rag that is going out of business.That's a fact Jack!Here is a link so you can realize REAL FACTShttp://www.realclearpolitics.com/epo...oval-1044.htmlA compiling of ALL polls shows 49.3% disapprove over all.

5322	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1593	Your spurious and slanted Newsweek poll IS included.
5323	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1596	My opinions are based not on either left wing or right wing propaganda.

5325	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1596	Both by commission and by omission.
5326	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1596	And also what I know about leadership and rating an employees performance.
5327	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1596	And the pres IS an employee of the people.I consider him fired, but the rules say he has thru 2012 to vacate.
5328	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1596	And Reagan's methods were polar opposites of this clown and were showing signs of improvement in spite of a 100% negative press AND 20% inflation.
5329	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1596	RR didn't even have Fox to present a positive view.

5331	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1596	Unless you consider the 54 jobs, &quot;created or saved&quot; in LA AT A COST OF $111 MILLION.
5332	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1596	I'm fairly certain that at $2 million per job, my pet cat could save a bunch of jobs.

5344	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	&quot;Reagan got plenty of good press- reporters loved him.

5347	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	Fox is just a propaganda arm for the RNC- pretty much the same as MSNBC is for the DNC.
5348	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	People were saying pretty much this same stuff about Reagan at this point, and it all turned around.
5349	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	Saint Reagan started off with a screwed up economy and was there for the turn around.
5350	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	Obama started off with a screwed up economy and will be here for the turn around too.But if it hasn't turned around- well then the voters can vote him out of office.
5351	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1599	Thats how things are done via the Constitution.

5359	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1602	Nowhere at any time did I say anyone was being PAID $2 million.
5360	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1602	Read what it says, not what you'd prefer it said.FROM the LA Times, an acknowledged far left publication:&quot;As Tim Cavanaugh noted previously, L.A.&#8217;s comptroller has issued two briefs indicating that two city agencies have so far managed to create just 55 jobs with $111 million in stimulus money.
5361	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1602	Now the Los Angeles Times follows up, noting that the real worry, according to the comptroller, is that the agencies are not spending money fast enough:&quot;The first report I heard was 54 jobs, the LA Times says 55 jobs, close enough for me.
5362	Jollee	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1603	Jollee, California
5363	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1604	So in other words the stimulus was used to pay for infrastructure that cost 111 million dollars.
5364	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1604	A more reasonable price.

5375	Iriemon	The Mello Guy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1607	They made you think that all $111 million was spent and only 55 jobs created.What's really happened is the bulk of that money has been allocated, but not spent, and is waiting for the projects to be OKed, then the money will be spent and over 230 more people put to work.When you've been deceived by the same source over and over again, at what point do you stop gullibly accepting anything they say as if it were the word of the Lord?
5376	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	False.
5377	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Obama has cut taxes.
5378	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	He didn't set the sunset provisions in the Bush tax cuts.
5379	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Bush was President when that happened and obama was not even in the Senate when Bush signed it into law.
5380	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	I've searched all through government websites and have not found anything called &quot;Obamacare.
5381	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	But, the health care reform law that President Obama signed will slow the growth of health care costs for our country and will help reduced deficit spending.
5382	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	That's assuming those big spenders in the GOP don't gain control of the government.
5383	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Which shows what a failure bush and the GOP are on national defense and budget issues.
5384	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	They start a war in Afghanistan as the WoT, then (*)(*)(*)(*) near stop it to start a war on Iraq, that had nothing at all to do with terrorism or our national defense, then allowed al Qaeda/Taliban to grow strong after having them on the run.
5385	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Untrue.
5386	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	Almost a third of the deficits can be attributed to Bush policies, another third to the Bush recession/financial implosion lowering the economic activity and tax collections.
5387	Shanty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1609	And a third in fixing the damage left behind.
5388	Dan40	Shanty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1610	Would you be so kind as to list some of the US Federal Govt programs that have become deeply involved in the private sector and have reduced, controlled, or slowed the increase of costs.
5389	Dan40	Shanty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1610	You may use any programs from 1776 until today and list as many or as few as you wish.
5390	Taxpayer	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1611	I am not a supporter of Obama or his health care bill, but to answer your question I'd argue that the post office is one example.
5391	Taxpayer	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1611	Every year, I sit down with carriers from UPS and FedEx to hammer out an agreement for shipping in the coming year and the existence of the post office as an inferior but sufficient fall back option keeps ever rising costs from both companies in check in a way that competition between the two does not.
5392	Taxpayer	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1611	Real health care reform could have provided a similar inferior but sufficient health service for our citizens that had a similar effect on our health care industry.
5393	Taxpayer	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1611	Sadly, we got Obamacare instead.
5394	Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	According to the US Govt Accounting Office, Not FOX, not the tea party, not any right wing media or publication.
5395	Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	LOSSES for the USPS in 2008 $2.8 BILLION, 2009 $3.0 BILLION, and 2010 looks to be worse.
5396	Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	So whatever savings you THINK you're getting by playing the USPS off private carriers, is more than offset in the taxes needed to support the failing USPS.
5397	Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	But probably, more than any other Govt office, the USPS is trying to be competitive.
5398	Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	But in the real business world, trying to be competitive, but failing, meant bankruptcy.
5399	Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	Now if you're well connected, it means bailout.
5400	Dan40	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1612	If not well connected, bankrupt.
5401	kreo	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1613	Yes, but it is good for the consumers, because it increase competition and decrease shipping cost so it facilitates business overall.
5402	kreo	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1613	That means more money is getting in to the treasury.

5419	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1619	Not a contrary OPINION, but a provable fact, showing that Beck lied?

So if it is a $2 million lifetime cap, the insurance company KNOWS their max exposure and knows what factor to add in to the premium to cover that.
5550	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	These are long standing laws before the actual birth, wherever it was, of obummer.Now the obamacare bill stops pre-existing exclusions and lifetime caps.
5551	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Meaning 100% certain that premiums WILL go up.
5552	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	THEY ALREADY ARE GOING UP!!
5553	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	UNEMPLOYMENT is down 1/2 percent???&quot; From May through August, thejobless rate remained in the range of 9.5 to 9.7 percent.&quot;And in reality has stayed in the same range for more than a year.
5554	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	So the BLS, not me, says you don't know what you're talking about.Fluctuating between 10% and 9.5% is FLUCTUATING, not going down.
5555	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Or is that liberal math?
5556	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	10% MINUS 9.7% EQUALS 1/2 PERCENT?
5557	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1633	Not in the real world.
5558	TheTaoOfBill	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1634	Yup.
5559	TheTaoOfBill	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1634	They're pretty stable and at a very winable number considering the numbers the top republican candidates for 2012 are getting.
5560	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	A poll pitting obummer against ANY REPUBLICAN, said oBum would lose.He started at 65% approval and began losing that as is normal.
5561	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	But as time went on and he became more and more revealed as both arrogant without any reason to be arrogant, AND sadly incompetent at the same time, his approval fell down to his sheeple base of about 46%.
5562	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	That was over a year ago.
5563	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	Slowly some of the sheeple base has been opening their eyes and over the last year he has slowly gone down to 42%.
5564	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	After Nov. he WILL drop into the 30's and then he is finished.
5565	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	Even the Democrat National Committee will then acknowledge him as the empty suit in the White House.
5566	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	Some Democrats already see that.
5567	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	Are you aware that almost universally, Democrats running for re-election are avoiding any mention of obummer or his policies.
5568	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1635	They're trying to make themselves look like pseudo-Republicans.
5569	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	ANY republican ALWAYS does better than a specific republican.
5570	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	Because no two republicans can agree on what it means to be republican.
5571	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	There are the Ron Paul libertarians.
5572	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	There are the moral right Christian conservatives.
5573	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	The younger more progressive conservatives.
5574	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	And everything in between.
5575	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1636	When you put Obama up against any specific republican candidate he generally wins.
5576	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	That is not true.
5577	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	Beginning with the Dem tax increase in 1993, tax revenues grew far faster than the economy.
5578	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	Spending however, grew much slower than the economy, a trend that continued thru 20001.
5579	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	That is the difference between a conservative and a liberal.
5580	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	The conservative says you have a pre-existing condition?
5581	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	Tough just get sick and die.
5582	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	The liberal says everyone shares the risk.
5583	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	We are all Americans.That's why I'm proud to be a liberal.
5584	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1637	Unemployment rate:Oct 2009 10.1%Aug 2009 9.6%http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm10.1-9.6 = 0.5% or 1/2%.I stand by my post.
5585	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1638	A pre-existing condition is something that presented itself before you chose to have the insurance.A person applying for insurance for a pre-existing condition is taking no risk, they know they will use the services they are asking to receive at a discount.
5586	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1638	That cost savings to them will be paid for by others, who risked buying insurance without knowing if they would develop the need.The conservative asks why didn't you buy insurance before you developed this condition when we could all share the risk?
5587	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1638	The liberal answers because I didn't want to risk my money, I'd rather have you take care of me.That's why I'd be embarrassed to be a liberal.
5588	Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	That is not necessarily true at all.
5589	Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	That is the idea behind insurance.
5590	Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	The liberal answers that I had it and lost my job or was dropped by my carrier.
5591	Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	The conservate answers then go ahead and die.
5592	Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1639	That's why I'd be ashamed to be a conservative.
5593	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1640	Then you have no problem.
5594	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1640	When you lost your job you chose COBRA to continue your coverage or you bought new insurance when you were dropped by your carrier.
5595	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1640	In either case, you had uninterrupted coverage and so your current carrier does not consider your current ailment as a pre-existing condition.
5596	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1641	I think you are confusing the ideas of insurance and charity.
5597	Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1642	I'm not.
5598	Iriemon	Taxpayer	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1642	The purpose of insurance is to spread the risk among a population.
5599	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	The purpose of insurance is to TRANSFER the risk to an insurance company in exchange for a premium.
5600	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	Insurance companies are FOR PROFIT organizations.
5601	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	[I realize that the words, FOR PROFIT, are very confusing for liberals.]
5602	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	It means that they MUST take in more money in premiums than they pay out in claims and operating costs.
5603	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	It also means that they must keep the premiums at a sellable amount.
5604	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	It is not necessary for you to believe that, but it is absolutely true.Insurance companies COULD insure anybody, or everybody, for everything.
5605	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1643	But NO ONE would be able to afford the premium they would HAVE to charge in order to be profitable.
5606	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1644	Then you've definitely confused them.
5607	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1644	As I pointed out, the person you are describing has no risk.
5608	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1644	His liability is certain.
5609	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1644	You are not spreading out risk, you are simply spreading his definite cost to others.
5610	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself
5611	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	Then you should be proud and happy to pay for your Utopian liberals dreams, yourself, [its called charity] without bothering those of us who know your dreams are impracticable and unworkable, and unsustainable, and we do not wish to waste our resources on stupidity that does not work.In a disaster, TRIAGE, is done because it does the greatest good for the greatest number.
5612	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	TRIAGE is a FACT of everyday life too.
5613	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	Not everyone is going to make it.
5614	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	That is FACT, your liberalism is dream.
5615	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	In your words:&quot;Oct 2009 10.1%Aug 2009 9.6%&quot;Ahhh, I don't know how to break this to you gently, so I'll just say it.
5616	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1645	ITS SEPTEMBER 2010 AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT IS STILL AT THE SAME PLACE!!!!
5617	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1646	No one said anything about insurance companies, but insurance.
5618	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1646	I agree insurance companies exists FOR PROFIT.
5619	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1646	That means, to MAXIMIZE PROFIT insurance companies will drop people with conditions and try to avoid paying with exceptions in their policies.
5620	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1646	And that is why, because insurance companies exist to MAXIMIZE PROFIT they will not cover you if you are old or have a pre-existing condition because you are more likely to get SICK and need HEALTH CARE.So unless your view is that only those who are young and healthy and who can afford to pay for coverage FOR PROFIT insurance companies provide should be able to get HEALTH CARE, this is exactly why a system of private insurance based on FOR PROFIT insurance companies DOES NOT WORK.
5621	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	There is no &quot;insurance&quot; without insurance companies.
5622	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	And please do not claim Medicare, which is processed through insurance companies for a fee, and Social Security.
5623	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Both of which you want to do cancel.
5624	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	And Medicaid which is welfare, not insurance
5625	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	PROFITABLE INDUSTRIES#1.
5626	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Beverages-Brewers-------------25.9% profit#10 Industrial Metals&amp; Minerals---14.8%#20 Diversified Communications----11.7%#30 Home Health Care--------------08.4%#40 Regional Northeast Banks------07.0%#50 Sporting Avtivities-----------06.0%#60 Aerospace Products&amp;Services---05.2%#70 Consumer Services-------------04.3%#80 Major Integrated Oil % Gas----03.5%#86 Health Care Insurance---------03.3%These are NET profits.
5627	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Besides those listed above, Entertainment, Utilities, Tobacco Products ,Auto Parts, and many, many others are more to much more profitable businesses
5628	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Your last statement is inane ideological nonsense and false.
5629	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Insurance companies MUST be for profit [I said in a previous post that you wouldn't understand that and obviously you don't] and they do exist and they do work and they have worked for many years.The problem with health insurance specifically is that your kind of liberal thinking has screwed it up.
5630	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	You want insurance to be a payor of convenience and it can NEVER be that.
5631	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	It must only cover risk, and the more risk we ask it to cover, the MORE expensive it MUST be.
5632	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	The present problem is that everyone wants the health insurance company to PAY from the first dollar of charges on.
5633	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	That causes the premium to be higher because we are transferring ALL risk to the insurance company.
5634	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	When they also have to cover pre ex and no limits, the premiums MUST go MUCH higher.
5635	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	There is NO way around that.
5636	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	We do NOT ask any other type of insurance to do that, why do we ask health insurance to be a payor of convenience instead of covering our UNACCEPTABLE risk.Would you pay a $200.00 dollar collision premium on a $500 car?
5637	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	No, because the $500.
5638	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	RISK is acceptable.Same thing, even if you went to the Doctor every month @ $100.00 per visit and your insurer paid for each visit.
5639	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	They MUST charge you a premium that will cover their known risk of what might happen with your health AND that premium also has to be high enough to also cover your $100 per month Doc charges.
5640	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	ie the premium MUST be much higher than $1200 per year.
5641	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1647	Probably 2 to 3 times higher since the first $1200 is only recovering their costs.
5642	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	Sure there is government insurance, like medicare and social security.
5643	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	Interesting.
5644	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	So what?
5645	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	Interesting.
5646	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	So what?
5647	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	Right.
5648	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	So the FOR PROFIT insurance company to avoid RISK will cut off the aged and unhealthy.
5649	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1648	That is why it DOES NOT WORK.
5650	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1649	I'll correct the typo:&quot;Oct 2009 10.1%Aug 2010 9.6%&quot;Thanks!

5662	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1652	I'd love to hear your explanation of how an economy going from tanking at -7% real and losing 700,000 jobs a month to growing private sector jobs being added is *not* improving.
5663	RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	The Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Wednesday shows that 28&#37; of the nation's voters Strongly Approve of the way that Barack Obama is performing his role as president.
5664	RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	Forty-three percent (43%) Strongly Disapprove, giving Obama a Presidential Approval Index rating of -15 (see trendshttp://www.rasmussenreports.com/publ..._tracking_poll28% love him 48% have no love for the man. I would personally tar and feather him well no, I don't hate him that much and almost feel sorry for him.
5665	RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	At first and during the election (more like a love Obama orgy 100 millionsum') he seemed like an idealist kid that had no experience but lots of dreams.
5666	RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	(his lack of executive and other experience along with his need to be liked nearly destroyed him and us, ie the nation).
5667	RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	The trouble is the wanderlust kid is taking the nation down by implementing his socialist leaning ill thought out idealism or maybe just wishful fiat thinking that those trillions here and trillions there will come from 'somewhere' and he seems to be trying to make us like him the same way a bad father spoils a child.
5668	RevAnarchist	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1653	We really need a tough love parent...um' president not a perhaps well meaning but naive enabler.ra
5669	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1654	Specifically, what socialist leaning ill thought out idealism has Obama implemented to date that you believe had been tearing the nation down, and do you blame that socialist leaning ill thought out idealism for the fact the economy was tanking at -7% and losing 700,000 jobs per month before Obama ever took office.
5670	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1656	The Health care program hasn't even gotten off the ground yet.Since you have identified the Health care program as the &quot;socialist leaning ill thought out idealism has Obama implemented to date that you believe had been tearing the nation down&quot;, please explain specifically in your view how that has caused the current economic situation or how it contributed to the fact the economy was tanking at -7% real and losing 700,000 jobs a month before Obama took office.
5671	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1656	Personally, I can't see how the health care program had one iota to do with the current state of the economy, proving your assertion is nothing more than baseless, partisan political nonsense.
5672	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	We are talking about people buying insurance and asking to be covered for conditions that pre-existed their having insurance (if they have in place prior insurance that covered the condition, this is a non-issue).What I have said in my previous post is not true for only some, but for everyone who asks to be covered for a pre-existing condition.Everyone of these people is asking for something beyond insurance, they are not trying to share the risk that they might need treatment with others who also might need treatment.
5673	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	They are asking others to pay more, so they can pay less, for treatment they know they will need.If you want to institute this, make the argument.
5674	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	But do not characterize this as simply insurance or characterize it as risk sharing -- it is neither.
5675	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	It is charity.
5676	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	To be clear, I am not saying it is wrong to offer charity.
5677	Taxpayer	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1658	But it is misleading to claim this would be anything other than charity.
5678	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	From one side of your mouth you say Medicare and Social Security are INSURANCE.
5679	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	But on other threads you claim that the Medicare and Social Security beneficiaries ARE NOT entitled to their benefits even though they paid in to the program all their lives and in the case of Medicare they continue to pay at $100.
5680	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	per month per person.
5681	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	You want to take away those benefits to reduce the debt.YOU CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.
5682	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	That is liberalism 101 and it is wrong now, has always been wrong, and always will be wrong.in&#183;sur&#183;ance (n-shrns)a. Coverage by a contract binding a party to indemnify another against specified loss in return for premiums paid.
5683	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	You intimate in previous posts that insurance companies are making a killing.
5684	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Just as your lying clown in the White House constantly claims they are.When the fact is that if insurance companies had a raw material cost like manufacturers do, they could not make it on 3.3&#37; profit.When shown that insurance companies are not making a killing you say, &quot;Interesting, So What?&quot; So what is that is shows your position to be pure ideological nonsense and brainwashing.
5685	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Without any fact to give credence to your nonsense.AGAIN.
5686	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Please read AND comprehend the definition of insurance above.
5687	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	It is obvious you have no idea of the concept of insurance.
5688	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	If you did understand what insurance IS, you would understand that your arguments have no merit whatsoever.And is it possible that you could actually believe that insurance companies have been in existence for well over 100 years and the politicians have not been massively regulating them for many decades.
5689	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	What other 100 plus year old industry has Govt kept their nose out of?
5690	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	RIGHT!
5691	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	NONE, including insurance.Your clown-in-charge lied many times about the man with cancer that had his insurance canceled to avoid the expense by the insurer.
5692	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Every word of that story was a lie.1.
5693	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	It was a NEW policy.
5694	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	2.
5695	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	He had pre-existing conditions that he FAILED to list on the application.
5696	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	3 Insurance regulation BY THE STATE GOVTS allows insurers 2 years to investigate a new policy for pre-existing conditions.
5697	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	4.
5698	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	The man appealed because his pre-ex was not cancer and he had no pre-ex of cancer.
5699	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	5.
5700	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	The insurance company was totally justified in canceling the policy for cause, BUT THEY DID RELENT BECAUSE THE PRE-EX WAS NOT CANCER.
5701	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	They were NOT forced to relent, the insurance company choose to cover the man's cancer treatment and they did.
5702	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	6.
5703	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	He underwent the full range of cancer treatment, paid for by the insurance company.
5704	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	7.
5705	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	He lived another 4 years after the completion of treatment.But the lying obummer said his insurance canceled the man's policy and he died FOR lack OF TREATMENT.Total lies to con bad legislation on the public Luckily all but the brainless sheeple know he was lying..Once a policy is in force and past the 2 year look back.
5706	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1659	Insurance companies BY LAW, cannot cancel a health insurance policy for an individual except for non-payment of premium.
5707	RevAnarchist	Iriemon;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	It's the law of the land, and you seem oblivious to the fact that people that control money are nervous types.
5708	RevAnarchist	Iriemon;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Even a baseless rumor can cause panic and freeze funds.
5709	RevAnarchist	Iriemon;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Don't beleive me try to get a moderately large small business loan (in the hundred thousand dollar range).
5710	RevAnarchist	Iriemon;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I don't have that kind of money but know those that do and they say banks are sitting on it as do other sources.
5711	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	First, with all due respect and accompanying niceties, don't attempt to box me in to your parameters.
5712	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I was making a commentary not a doctoral dissertation or laying out detailed abstract critiquing our economic woes.
5713	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	And lastly a request.
5714	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Please use quote tags as a matter of common courtesy.
5715	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	When someone interprets my bad grammar I don’t know if they are being accurate, as I said here before, I cheated my way through K3&gt; through middle school English, then high school and college English Grammar and sometimes math, and now, because of my ignorance we are all paying for it!
5716	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	So my grammar being bad I understand if you make wrong assumptions etc. Quote tags make it so much easier and lessen the mistaken assumptions and helps everyone.
5717	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Ok I found the post number 1654 page number 166 ; Rev said &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'The trouble is the wanderlust kid is taking the nation down by implementing his socialist leaning' &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;That was an opinion and it means I believe Obama is a socialist at heart and will attempt to mould the USA into a socialist nation.
5718	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	that the nation will not survive as a socialist country IMO, and by taking it down I meant it won’t be a capitalist representative democratic republic as it is today, but rather some type of socialist Nation, with Obama at the helm of course.
5719	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Rev said &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'ill thought out idealism' &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was suggesting that he thought things would work by the power of his personality and popularity.Rev said &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'or maybe just wishful fiat thinking that those trillions here and trillions there will come from 'somewhere' &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;By that I meant that the our fiat currency is allowing him to spend those trillions, making our loan officers nervous.
5720	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I believe they know that we are printing money to pay for Obamas trillion dollar projects/recovery etcRev said &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;'and he seems to be trying to make us like him the same way a bad father spoils a child.
5721	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	We really need a tough love parent...um' president not a perhaps well meaning but naive enabler.'

5723	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I don’t say that lightly my lively hood depends on how well my two non profit missions and churches perform, all three which use federal grants and private donations.
5724	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Now they are performing in the red and have been since the crash.
5725	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Well no, my reply/rant was comment just like most of your posts and others here.
5726	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Partisan?
5727	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	No again, I vote the issues not the party.
5728	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I know I may sound like I vote by the party but that is incorrect.
5729	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	That said (corrected) I agree that the health care atrocity had a demonstrable effect on our economy at the moment, and did not mean to imply that.
5730	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	No it's the entire Obama package makes those that have real money nervous.
5731	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	I am speaking of corporations and those that lend us gadzillion dollar sums.
5732	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	Until they have faith and trust in Obama the recovery is going to drag along.
5733	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1660	ra
5734	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	You think?
5735	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	Hey, I think we have discovered why Murdoc News constantly puts out the negative, misleading information about the economy!
5736	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	What is a quote tag?
5737	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	I quoted your words not because of your grammar but because folks here so often mischaracterize statements, so I try to quote verbatim the relevant statement so as not to mischaracterize.
5738	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	We've been socialist for 85 years now and done OK, haven't we?
5739	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	And we need to restore revenues by increasing taxes.Sorry to hear about your churches.
5740	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	Do churches really get federal $$?
5741	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	I guess that started during the Bush administration?
5742	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	I had thought that was unconstitutional.
5743	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	OK, so its not health care after all that is responsible for tearing the nation down.
5744	Iriemon	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1664	We've clarified that.Instead, it is the &quot;entire Obama package&quot; that makes those that have real money nervous that is tearing the country down.How is the &quot;entire Obama package&quot; doing that, and upon want facts or data, if any, do you have to demonstrate that is the cause?
5745	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	I don't think Medicare is akin to Insurance.
5746	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	SS is. If I said Medicare was I mis-spoke and withdraw it.
5747	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	Medicare is Govt national health care, available only to those over 65.
5748	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	It's not wrong at all.
5749	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	There is no contract that guarantees you SS or medicare benefits.
5750	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	The fact you paid taxes in life does give you entitlements.
5751	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	I've never claimed SS is an insurance policy.
5752	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	I've said it is social insurance, like insurance the pool resources and provide benefits if and only if certain conditions occur.
5753	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	I've intimated nothing of the sort.
5754	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	Quit wasting my time with strawmen.I siad that insurance companies are for profit and therefore will endeavor to avoid paying benefits by excluding coverage on those more likely to meet the condition for benefits.
5755	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	Because it is irrelevant.
5756	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	How do you figure?
5757	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1665	My position is logical and factually supported.
5758	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1666	You do have a sense of humor!
5759	Jollee	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1667	If you worked your entire life, you paid mega money into Medicare, they just borrowed it and spent it wrong!

5763	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1671	Thanks.
5764	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1671	You have a sense of dodging and dancing when you have no argument.
5765	Jollee	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1672	Ha Ha Ha, so funny and maybe true... maybe not......
5766	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	I've lumped all of the above in one quote, since all of it shows you to have no knowledge of the country you live in.The above programs, Medicare, and Social Security are each INSURANCE.
5767	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Both are coverage in exchange for premiums.
5768	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	One is medical coverage, one is social coverage.
5769	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And they are our ONLY 2 &quot;ENTITLEMENT&quot; programs.
5770	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Entitlements are bad mouthed on both sides of the aisle, but what they are lumping in with M &amp;SS are give away programs, which are not entitlements, they are welfare, like subsidized housing, food stamps, Medicaid.
5771	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Our 2 real entitlement programs have PAID their premiums.
5772	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	It is the politicians, both parties, that have blown the Med.
5773	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	&amp; SS money on many things including the welfare programs listed above, that do not pay in a penny but take out Billions per year.But I digress, Medicare and Social Security are insurance programs MANDATED by the Govt.
5774	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	We do not have the choice of paying for them or not.
5775	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	The premiums are taken in the form of FICA taxes.Are you in any way aware of what F.I.C.A. means?Federal INSURANCE Contributions Act.
5776	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And is separate from income taxes.
5777	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	6.2&#37; and 1.45% of income is taken FOR Social Security and Medicare respectively.
5778	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And both are means tested.
5779	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Medicare the more you've made in your working life, the more you've paid in, but you receive only the exact same benefit of anyone that made minimum wage for only 40 quarters of their working life.
5780	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Plus if you make over $100,000 and you're on Medicare, you monthly premium is higher than people making less.
5781	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Plus those in lower income ranges can have premiums lower or waived altogether and co-pays reduced or zeroed.Social Security, the more you made, the more you paid in, the more benefit you receive.
5782	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	THAT is means testing.
5783	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And if one is making over $108,000.
5784	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	their SS tax stops, as does the accrual of any more benefit.
5785	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Yes, those people will get the max SS payout, but they also paid the highest PREMIUMS.
5786	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And if they are still making high incomes they pay income tax on their SS benefits at regular income tax rates on 50% of the benefit, or 85% of the benefit depending on their income.
5787	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	People living on SS alone, do not pay any income tax on their SS benefits.
5788	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Your every post makes it obvious to all readers that you either do hate the rich or you have been ideologically brainwashed into reciting the present day liberal line.
5789	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	In years past the liberal line was TAX BIG BUSINESS.
5790	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	But when they realized that the public KNEW that just meant higher prices, liberals changed to the &quot;hate the rich&quot; nonsense.
5791	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	And you have quite obviously bought into that stupidity, wholeheartedly.
5792	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Again your basic misconceptions about insurance show through.
5793	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Excluding coverage for those WITH pre-existing conditions is done, with 100% approval of insurance regulators[elected or appointed politicians], solely to keep premiums lower for those who are transferring risk to the insurance company in exchange for a premium.
5794	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Covering anyone already needing treatment is transferring COST, not risk.
5795	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	RISK is a necessary factor in the insurance equation.
5796	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Insurance companies CANNOT be in the business of taking on COSTS, they have to take on RISK.
5797	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Don't know why you are UNABLE to grasp that simple concept.
5798	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Your position is one of misconception, and ideological nonsense, and distortions.And I was being kind to say you have a sense of humor.
5799	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	Your fuzzy glimpse of reality is sad, not funny.
5800	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1673	If I was predisposed to feel sorry for people, I'm not, I'd feel sorry for you
5801	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I can see your point.
5802	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I'll agree medicare is like insurance to, in a way.
5803	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	You seem to have the mistaken impression that a political view that the wealthy ought to pay more taxes equates to hate.
5804	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	Of course it doesn't.
5805	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	Cost is a function of risk.
5806	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I completely understand that a person who is aged or has a pre-existing condition carries a greater risk of higher cost.
5807	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	That is why for profit private insurers will seek to cut out such persons.
5808	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	And why a system of private insurance does not work for national heath care.
5809	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I disagree with your opinions.
5810	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	Others can decide for themselves.
5811	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1674	I can tell you are not the kind who would feel sorry for people.
5812	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1675	And I am very comfortable with that.
5813	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1675	Feeling sorry for people instead of demanding they get off their ass and haul their own load is about 70% of our problems in this country.I did the &quot;red thing&quot; because it pleases you so.
5814	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1675	See I have a sense of macabre, err, humor too
5815	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1677	There's no legal contract with SS, and I'm pretty sure medicare as well.
5816	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1677	Again, I have no surprise you are not the kind would not feel sorry for people and are comfortable with it.It's why you are a conservative and I'm a liberal.

5850	REDRUM	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1685	Pardon me but &quot;We The People&quot; bailed out the banks, Wall Street and General Motors.
5851	REDRUM	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1685	I demand retribution and propose legislation for a 1&#37; tax on all stock market exchanges, 1% tax on all bank transactions and a 1% tax on every GM automobile sold, new or used.
5852	REDRUM	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1685	90% of that revenue generated from those taxes will be used as a down payment on The National Debt (Public Debt) and the remaining 10% will be dispersed in checks back to U.S. citizens who pay taxes.
5853	REDRUM	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1685	I am Shoey and this message is surely not White House approved.
5854	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1686	GIVEN, the past was bad.
5855	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1686	How does that make BHO, spending at a faster rate than any of the past pres' GOOD?They were bad, he is equally guilty and then some.
5856	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1686	Before you make some LAME AZZ excuse for him [the hallmark of his presidency] All the bad past people had &quot;good&quot; reasons for their spending too.
5857	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1686	Out of control spending IS out of control spending, no matter WHAT the supposed reason.
5858	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1686	Then and NOW!!
5859	Jollee	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1687	i WILL NOT VOTE FOR HIM AGAIN, HE DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE!
5860	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1688	What was the good reason for Bush squandering a surplus and running up $ 5 trillion in debt?What was the good reason for Reagan taking a small deficit and quadrupling it and tripling the debt?Obama inherited the worst economic situation since the great depression that mandated fiscal stimulus.I agree he needs to reduce the deficits and should raise taxes and trim spending.
5861	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1688	I've said it many times.
5862	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	What you cannot comprehend is that they always have a &quot;good&quot; reason.
5863	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Same as obummer has a &quot;good&quot; reason.
5864	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	But their good reason AND obummer's good reasons are simply excuses put out by the spenders.
5865	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	THERE is no good reasons for spending Trillions we do not have.
5866	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	There was no good reason then, there is no good reason now.
5867	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	And you need to study history with your eyes and ears and mind open.
5868	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	What obummer faced and faces is about 1/2 as bad as what Reagan faced.
5869	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Less than half actually.
5870	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Same bad economy, same bad unemployment PLUS massive DOUBLE DIGIT INFLATION.I lived and worked in those days.
5871	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	If a person made a $2000 IRA contribution to a bank for 22 years, at the interest rate banks were paying for an ordinary CD, they would become a millionaire.
5872	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	You could go to the grocery store a week later and buy the exact same grocery list and pay $20, $25.00 more for the same goods.
5873	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Did Reagan BELIEVE he had a good reason for spending like he did?
5874	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Sure he did.
5875	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	But we are paying today for the precedent he set then.
5876	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	Same as we will pay for obummer's idiocy.
5877	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	We will suffer in the future for obummer's policies today, PLUS inflation WILL run wild again.A chemo treatment that is 100% effective against cancer is useless if it also kills the patient.
5878	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	That was oBum's treatment plan except that it is killing the patient AND it is not effective.
5879	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1689	But it IS more expensive than anything else ever tried in history.
5880	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	During a sever recession there are very good reasons to increase spending.
5881	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	It creates demand and picks up slack caused by the overreaction of the markets and economy to lessen the full effect of the recession or recessionary spiral into depression.
5882	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	Interest rates were high because of the Fed's actions to kill inflation, but Reagan inhereted an economy where the relative size of the debt was the lowest in 45 years and the economy was growing at 7+&#37; real.
5883	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	Obama inherited record deficits, the highest relative debt in 60 years, and an economy tanking at -7% real.Easy choice which one I'd rather walk into.
5884	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	Depends on what you mean.
5885	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	Relatively the Govt spent far more on WWII and probably close to the same for Reagans military buildup.
5886	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1690	And in perspective, the spending on the stimulus is no more than the cost of the mistaken Iraq war, and really only a couple years extra annual military spending compared to 2000.
5887	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Not true.
5888	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Obama has spent like a mad man. Keep drinking the kool-aid.
5889	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Except?
5890	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	You mean accept.

5892	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Please elaborate on the good choices.
5893	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	I can't seem to think of any, oh that's because there are none.
5894	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Everything he does is to redistribute wealth.
5895	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	The unemployment rate has gone way up.
5896	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	He lied many times about health care.
5897	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	The problem is he does everything that is unpopular.
5898	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	He is supposed to follow what the people want.
5899	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Everything he does is opposite of the public opinion.
5900	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	In other words there are more people upset than happy.
5901	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Yeah since he had a choice Obama has only continued the war, drones left and right.
5902	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Well he is the commander in chief, that is his job.As for the criticism...
5903	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	People are finally catching on to his non-sense, even the people who fell for it in the first place.
5904	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Hell yes we are going to criticize him when he is spending our money like it grows on trees to give to people who do NOTHING.
5905	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	No, he doesn't.
5906	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	We aren't moving to a socialist/communist nation.
5907	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	Why give someone a second chance?
5908	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	He's not going to change his ideas.
5909	jthorp24	Ares	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1692	He is set on running America straight into the ground.
5910	onalandline	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1694	You're right.

5914	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Foregoing the obvious quip about a certain other recent President, I'd have to nominate James K Polk as the worst President in US history, considering the fact that he started a blatant war of aggression and territorial expansion on the flimsiest of pretexts, and nearly started another war with Britain for similar reasons.As for Obama, I would say that he's done a remarkable job under very adverse circumstances, and even if his Presidency ended today, he'd be remembered as a notable President with many accomplishments.Let's examine it point by point: - &quot;He has not kept most of his campaign promises.&quot; Really?

5933	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	While Obama certainly could have done better in this regard, he's certainly made improvements compared to his predecessors.
5934	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	For example, you can track exactly where the stimulus money is going at http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/home.aspx - &quot;He has/will raise taxes on everyone (no tax cut for 95% of Americans).&quot;Well duh.
5935	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Anyone who was elected President in 2008 would have had to raise taxes at some point.
5936	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	The Bush tax cuts were simply irresponsible and unsustainable.
5937	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He has increased spending/size of government to record levels.&quot;You're talking about the stimulus bill?
5938	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	I will remind you that two years ago economists from all over the political spectrum were warning of the very real danger of a second Great Depression.
5939	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	In case you've forgotten your high school history, the Great Depression involved unemployment rates in the neighborhood of 25%, thousands of bank failures, huge numbers of American forced to lived in Hoovervilles - makeshift camps for the homeless.
5940	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	You really think averting economic collapse isn't worth spending money on?
5941	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He has /will increase our deficit to record levels.&quot;So a huge recurring, structural deficit to fund tax cuts for the rich is okie-dokie, but a one time emergency expenditure is the end of the world?
5942	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	And weren't you just complaining about taxes being raised?

5944	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He ignores The People and pushes through legislation any way he can.&quot;Errr, weren't you criticizing Clinton just a few years ago for making policy decisions based on polling?
5945	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	And I seem to recall pretty constant complaints about a &quot;Do nothing Congress.&quot; You should really make up your mind which you want.
5946	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He has weakened national security/border security.&quot;How exactly?
5947	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Obama has reduced the stress on a severely overextended US military.

5949	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Honestly, just running around the world threatening to bomb anyone we don't like does not make the US any more secure.
5950	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Considering that it greatly reduces the credibility of threats of military force, I'd say it does the opposite.
5951	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	As for the border, if anything, Obama has increased border enforcement compared to Bush.
5952	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He has several proposed policies that will hurt Americans and our economy.&quot;Such as what?
5953	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	I really have no idea what you're on about with this one.
5954	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	You consider an economic policy that leads to 9% unemployment rather then 25% to have hurt the economy?
5955	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	How exactly do you figure that?
5956	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He is shunning our allies and kissing the asses of our enemies.&quot;Anyone who ever uttered the words &quot;freedom fries&quot; has absolutely no room to speak on this subject.
5957	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Real friends tell you when you're making a mistake.
5958	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	People who simply go along with anything and everything you want aren't friends, they're sycophants.
5959	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	And have you ever considered actually asking our allies what they think of the matter?
5960	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Obama is very popular in Europe and the rest of the world.
5961	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	I happened to be on a trip to England on election day 2008 (I voted by absentee ballot) and when I went to the airport to come back, the guy at the customs desk gave me a hearty congratulations on Obama's election when he saw my US passport.
5962	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	As for our enemies, Iran, at least, is in a much, much weaker position now then it was two years ago.
5963	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Between internal dissension (Which Obama encouraged by holding out a hand in his inaugural) and growing international opposition (Thanks to Obama engaging in actual *diplomacy*) Ahmadinejad's regime has gone from being on the verge of regional domination to severely hemmed in and with few options.
5964	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	- &quot;He continues to spew lies and BS to the American people.&quot;Unless you'd care to provide actual examples, this is a meaningless insult on about the level of accusing Obama of having cooties.To sum up, although Obama has been far from perfect and can certainly be criticized on many points, over all he's done quite a good job under very adverse circumstances.
5965	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Yes, the economy still sucks, but you know what?
5966	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	The President can't simply order prosperity to return.
5967	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	The US economy is a massive thing with a mind of its own that the government has only limited means to influence.
5968	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	There really isn't a magic wand in a safe in the White House somewhere.
5969	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Well, unless you're advocating a change to a command economy...Things are much better then they would have been otherwise.
5970	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Why Democrats aren't running on this is a puzzle to me. Some commentators seem to think that is too complex an argument for American voters to grasp.
5971	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	I sincerely hope they're wrong.So yes, I will very likely vote to re-elect Obama.
5972	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	And no, I almost certainly wouldn't vote for Palin.
5973	Kessy_Athena	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1696	Regardless of what you think of her politics, Palin has demonstrated a disturbingly weak grasp of the issues and her competence to perform the duties of the office are questionable at best.

5980	onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	Obamacare will most certainly be disastrous, and most Americans favor a repeal.

5987	onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	Most Americans were against Obamacare because most Americans know it will not do what Obama thinks it will.

5994	onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	He said it would stay under 8%, yet has gone to 10%.
5995	onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	What makes you think he had anything to do with the numbers not getting worse?
5996	onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	Maybe they would not have reached 10% if Obama left the private sector alone and didn't spend like Paris Hilton on Rodeo Drive.

6003	onalandline	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1698	Just speculation.

6011	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1699	And, when they do -- as I have on occasion -- the DAN-NO rebuttal is more of the same opinionated nonsense.
6012	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1699	Like MOST conservatives, your posts reveal that you &quot;think?&quot; posting the same stuff over and over will convince others you have an argument.

6016	jthorp24	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1700	ONE thing
6017	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	First, you don't know what the tea party is. You only know what your brainwashing elitists tell you to think.
6018	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	The tea party, simply put, is the overwhelming majority of American Citizens.
6019	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Mainstream America IS the tea party, some actually join, others are just sympathetic to tea party ideas.And everything I posted that elicited your derogatory quote is an accurate depiction of liberal statements.
6020	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Made over and over and over.

6022	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Yes conservatives DO have opinions, based in reality and truth.
6023	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Your quote PROVES that liberals have opinions too.
6024	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Based in beautiful theories that cannot continue.You liberals want all things for all persons, beautiful, a wonderful goal.
6025	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1701	Talk to CHARITIES, not Governments.
6026	Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	READERS Please Note!!!Conservatives like to hawk their &quot;views&quot; but seldom supply any &quot;unbiased&quot; sources for their &quot;facts.&quot; Research of their &quot;facts&quot; shows a heavy, fundamental reliance on Republican/Tea Party propaganda.
6027	Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	When challenged for their propaganda, they change the subject or ignore the challenge completely.
6028	Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	Thus, this is NOT debate, but a biased, single minded rehearsed tirade of unfounded, opinionated rhetoric.
6029	Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	Now, I am quick to remind all that it's perfectly OK to have an opinion and to post it no matter how perverse or ill-advised, BUT, in this American democracy, we the people, have the means to research such material and when one does, one is not surprised to discover just how slanted and unfounded conservative propaganda is.Here's an example: Both DAN-NO40 and Onalandline deride the &quot;Stimulus.&quot; How about the report just released today by the WH and confirmed in this article in The Washington Post:Report gives stimulus high marks by Lori Montgomery.
6030	Sassy	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1702	Read it and judge for yourself.

6032	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	It may be that 20 years is your &quot;Right&quot; time to evaluate the current president, but it's a trifle &quot;long&quot; term for me -- and perhaps for you depending upon your age.I was around when Reagan was president and even tho' I voted for Nixon, I found Reagan to be a B-picture actor &quot;acting&quot; like a president.
6033	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	His best performance was convincing everyone he was a &quot;good&quot; president.
6034	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	Further, he likely had Alzheimer's when he was in the WH, and it was reported that he was often caught 'nodding' off during meetings.
6035	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	Personally, I prefer to depend on someone who CAN be aroused at 2 AM with an emergency.I am an Independent, and I agree that Bratboy Bush was the worst president during my lifetime.
6036	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	I did not support Obama during the 2008 campaign (I supported Hillary and was very angry with the DNC for taking Texas away from her and 'giving' it to Obama and for ignoring the 18 million votes she got nationally.
6037	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	I blame Ted Kennedy for that bit of 'political slight of hand.'
6038	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	I never supported any Kennedy, either).But, there is NO way I can support the political perfidy that permeates the Republican party since Reagan.
6039	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	These people are 'off the charts' when it comes to reason and proffering their 'facts' as truth.
6040	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	They are pro-wealth and corporate personhood (Corporations are NOT human and have only one purpose: to make a profit.The Constitution was written FOR the preservation of 'human' life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, NOT profit).It is my opinion that the conservatives on the SCOTUS are a group of anti-Constitutional nincompoops!
6041	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	The best thing that Obama has done so far,in my view, is to nominate 2 more women to the Court.
6042	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	These brilliant women have faced the slings and arrows of sex discrimination by the &quot;good ole boys' club&quot; and likely will write opinions based on humanitarian rather than corporate needs when they must judge some of the crackpot laws the Republican dominated Congress passed and both GWB and WJC signed into law.

6044	Sassy	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1704	May they rue their votes to their political deathbed.

6046	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1706	Both parties are and have been guilty of taking anything out of context and using it to their best advantage.
6047	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1706	For instance, Reid did say what he is claimed to have said, THAT IS A FACT.
6048	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1706	Using it in a manner other than how he meant it IS politics.Simple fact, obummer came in with 69% approval.
6049	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1706	Today only 30% of the public says they would vote to re-elect him.
6050	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1706	That's the public saying that, not the politicians.

6064	Dan40	historycircus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1715	And we make better use of tools than other animals.
6065	Dan40	historycircus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1715	But make no mistake, we live in the same jungle as all the other animals do.
6066	Dan40	historycircus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1715	Ours is often made of concrete and steel now, instead of trees.
6067	Dan40	historycircus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1715	But we only changed its appearance, its still a jungle and always will be.
6068	Dan40	historycircus	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1715	And losers do not rule any jungle anywhere.

6073	TheTaoOfBill	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1716	All we would have needed it 3 republicans to believe in gay rights and we would have had open gays in the military.
6074	TheTaoOfBill	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1716	3 republicans.
6075	TheTaoOfBill	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1716	Don't give me that democrats don't deliver (*)(*)(*)(*).
6076	TheTaoOfBill	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1716	They worked their ass off for gay rights and the republicans said no to yet another civil rights issue.
6077	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	Now, for another lesson in 'truthiness:&quot;Therefore, if you KNOW what a politician or pundit says is a lie, then it's 'freedom of speech' for you to continue to spread that lie?
6078	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	On what moral compass do you set that philosophy?
6079	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	On what the serpent in the Garden of Eden had to say, perhaps?
6080	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	That's the kind of collective dishonesty that the tea party and their conservative fellow travelers use to spread their unAmerican philosophy of ' political hatred,' and their unreasonable goal to foster governmental turmoil and eventual destruction in a stable democracy.How can the tea party/conservative Republican party justify that philosophy without undermining the Constitutional ideals of 'human' life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and that 'all men (mankind) are created equal?'
6081	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	Again, Obama's popularity is NOT the question supporting this thread.
6082	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	It's, &quot;Would you vote for Obama in 2010?&quot; That's 2 years from now.
6083	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	In politics, that's an eternity.
6084	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	IOW, just another example of conservative distraction and manipulation to distort the facts to suit their political purposes.
6085	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1717	Some of us are not so intellectually ignorant or 'needy' for political 'purification.'
6086	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	Since you have hooked up the tea party and conservatives Republicans, it is obvious that you have not looked into it for yourself.
6087	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	YOU are simply repeating and spreading liberal lies.
6088	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	What conservative Republicans, or moderate Republicans, or radical Republicans, have to say does not matter to me any more than what Democrats of any ilk have to say.
6089	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	The Republican Party does not speak for the tea party and the tea party does not speak for the Republican Party.
6090	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	Democrats and Republicans ARE political parties.
6091	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	The tea party is not a political party, it is a grass roots movement of the MAJORITY of the American public.
6092	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	It does not speak with one voice, nor is it coordinated.
6093	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	The liberal media demonizes the tea party because they fear it.
6094	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	Not for violence, but that the liberal media is afraid of losing its power.
6095	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	And it will, precisely because the media SHOULD be reporting facts and events as they ARE, NOT as they'd like them to be.Rather than vomiting out the pablum your liberal loonies have taught you, you should go and see the tea party for yourself and with an open mind.
6096	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	What you will see is AMERICA working the way it is supposed to work.
6097	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	For the people, by the people.
6098	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1718	You should be embracing real America rather than helping spread lies by elitists afraid of losing their powers.The tea party is not a political party, but it is already larger than either the Democratic Party or the Republican Party.
6099	frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1719	Are you claiming that the washington post has a liberal bias???
6100	frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1719	:Laughing: Maybe that was the case in 1970, but that is certainly not the case in 2010.
6101	frodly	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1719	If anything, the Post has a right wing bias, not the other way around.
6102	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	The vote was 56 to 43.
6103	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Yet there are only 41 Republicans.
6104	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	You DID NOT get the Democratic/Independent vote EITHER.
6105	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	So HOW is it the Republicans fault?
6106	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Why are you not pointing the finger at your dissenting Democrats?????For well over a year Democrats had held a 60 to 40 super majority.
6107	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Yet they constantly claimed Republicans were blocking everything, a mathematical impossibility.
6108	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Now the Dems hold a 59 to 41 advantage.
6109	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	When the vote is 59 to 41, THEN you can gripe about Republicans, but it never is 59-41.
6110	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Get your own group in order, then complain.
6111	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1720	Until then blaming Republicans is just another in the long, long, line of liberal excuses and avoiding the blame for their own shortcomings.
6112	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	I couldn't possibly agree with you more, and I am a liberal.
6113	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	It is a lie to convince people who are left wing to continue to support the corporatist, decidedly not left wing Democratic party.
6114	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	So they lie and blame Republicans.
6115	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	Well many Democrats are not that stupid.
6116	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	Many Democrats understand math, and know that for about a year, Democrats could have done whatever they felt like.
6117	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	They could have passed progressive health care reform, that included a public option.
6118	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	Health care reform that benefited the American people, by insuring the uninsured and lowering premiums for the rest of us.
6119	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	Instead what we got was a handout to insurance companies.
6120	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	They continue to try to blame Republicans for their lack of progress, but the reality is they are owned by the same corporate and special interests that Republicans are.
6121	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	They have simply convinced people they are the party of the people.
6122	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1721	That is a lie, we have 2 parties of the rich and powerful, and none who are for the poor or more importantly the middle class.
6123	Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1722	When we really think about it, it's astonishing how much influence the Blue Dogs in the Senate have.
6124	Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1722	Their actions eventually led to the public option being dropped, resulting in poor legislation that is a major reason Democrats are being (*)(*)(*)(*)ted on in the polls.
6125	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	I don't even think it is only the Blue Dogs anyways.
6126	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	Ultimately the Blue Dogs are beholden to the Democratic party leadership.
6127	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	If the party does not fund their campaigns, they will have a hard time raising money themselves, unless they are particularly charismatic.
6128	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	It is the fault of the Democratic party leadership.
6129	frodly	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1723	They could have gotten a better health care bill through if they had the political will to do so, but they didn't.
6130	Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1724	Well that's included in the whole situation but allow them to do what they want and we see what happened.
6131	Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1724	If I'm Reid, Pelosi, Obama, and the DNC leadership I tell them to back this or we're gonna have to end up passing crappy legislation, which is what happened.
6132	Agent Zero	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1724	Ultimately, one party is out of their collective minds, and the other is too much of a wuss to get anything substantial done.
6133	CRIMSON MASK	Sly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1726	More than conservatives.
6134	CRIMSON MASK	Sly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1726	Obama has been at odds with the American people on almost every issue since he took office.
6135	CRIMSON MASK	Devil505	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1727	Really?
6136	CRIMSON MASK	Devil505	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1727	The guy has been giving campaign speeches and pushing his agenda at full speed since taking office.
6137	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	So we subtract $288 billion from the total stimulus and divide that remainder by the 2.5 million jobs that will eventually be created and we get that each job has cost $210,400.00.This you consider good?
6138	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	This you consider a good reason to go another trillion dollars in debt?The New Orleans levees?
6139	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	We have spent many billions to fix and improve the levees over the last 100 years.
6140	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	Not 10 cents on the dollar has ever reached the levees.
6141	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	LA. AND N.O. could teach Chicago things about corruption and graft, and that is really saying something.And the infrastructure?
6142	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	Indeed do the repairs, that was what the &quot;shovel ready&quot; projects were supposed to be all about.
6143	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	But then WHY did obummer ask, within the last month, for ANOTHER $50 BILLION STIMULUS expressly for infrastructure repairs?
6144	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	And $30 billion for teachers, and $26 billion for unemployment benefits to extend to 123 WEEKS!
6145	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1728	Add those amount in on the cost of jobs and it becomes much more than $210,400.00 per job.
6146	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	As a matter of fact, I do.
6147	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Would you prefer the government had used the money instead to directly hire people?
6148	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Or perhaps a direct subsidy to everyone?
6149	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Oh wait, wouldn't that be *gasp* socialism?Of course a more efficient stimulus would be preferable, but unless you have a suggestion on how to actually do that, I really don't see your point.
6150	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	The stimulus was obviously far from perfect, and constructive criticism is always welcome.
6151	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	But it was necessary, and suggesting that we shouldn't have done it is unreasonable, unless you seriously are saying that a depression with 25% unemployment would be preferable to the current situation.
6152	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Sources please?
6153	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	That's quite a claim you're making, I'd like to see something to substantiate it.
6154	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Even if it's true, it's rather beside the point.
6155	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	The NO levees are simply a symptom of a much larger problem.
6156	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Arguing that if LA is corrupt and therefore does not spend its infrastructure money effectively we should not be spending money on infrastructure is rather akin to arguing that if the Chicago fire department is corrupt and ineffective, we should stop spending money on fire protection period.
6157	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Well, for one thing, because because the American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that $1.6 trillion is needed over a five-year period to bring the nation's infrastructure to a good condition.http://apps.asce.org/reportcard/2005/index.cfmLike I said, the US has been neglecting its infrastructure for four decades.
6158	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	A large portion of our current infrastructure, especially the interstate system, was built in the 50's and 60's, with a design life of around 50 years.
6159	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	You do the math.
6160	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	The stimulus spending, even with another $50 billion added on, is just a drop in the bucket of what we really need.
6161	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	An unpleasant reality, but unless you think that you not having to pay taxes is more important then little things like functional transportation, water, electricity, and sewage systems...Yes, spending money on teachers is obviously a massive waste!
6162	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Who needs schools?
6163	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	The education our kids will get on the streets should be more then enough to keep the US competitive for decades to come, right?
6164	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	And unemployment?
6165	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Ha, if someone's out of work, it's obviously their own fault, and we should let their lazy asses starve!
6166	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Right?
6167	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1729	Right??We need to deal with the situation as it really is, and ignoring problems because you think they shouldn't exist is both irresponsible and irrational.Oh, and incidentally - considering that Tea Party backed candidates have been winning some and losing some in Republican primaries, and considering that party primaries are notoriously more partisan and farther from the center then the nation as a whole, I really think that claiming the Tea Party represents the overwhelming majority of the nation is a bit of an overstatement.
6168	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	I'd prefer the Govt stay out of the &quot;FREE&quot; Market.
6169	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	There is not one shred of PROOF that your statement is true.
6170	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Is it one possibility?
6171	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Yes, it is ONE of the possibilities.
6172	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Just as the economy is a living thing, it also could have recovered on its own.
6173	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	That is not saying it would have, just saying that is also one of the possibilities.$814,000,000,000.00 that we did not and do not have.
6174	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Every cent of it could have gone to tax relief.
6175	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	An immediate $814 BILLION in the hands of the people might have really STIMULATED the economy.
6176	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	That is NOT an alternative suggestion.
6177	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Its just one of the many possibilities.The Govt interfering in business was a major factor in the down economy.
6178	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Relying on the same people to fix the problem they caused is hardly the wisest move.
6179	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And before you start with the Bush blaming, I mean politicians of both parties over decades of inexperienced and enlightened interference in business.What the politicians did over time was to change the business heads from can do leaders and fierce competitors, into business politicians in order to get along with the Govt.
6180	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And like ALL politicians everywhere, the business politicians went bad same as the elected politicians do.
6181	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	If you want to substantiate it, do a tiny bit of research on your own and then you'll know.
6182	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	What you are UNaware of is not my problem.And if I wish to say something, I SAY IT.
6183	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And nowhere did I say that the levees should not be funded.
6184	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Saying the money got eaten up by corruption, which it did, is not saying the work shouldn't be done.
6185	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Federal highways and bridges, and Interstate Highways and bridges, are the responsibilities of the Federal Govt.
6186	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	All the other infrastructure is the responsibility of the state where the road or bridge is located.
6187	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Paying teachers is also the responsibility of the state in question.
6188	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Dealing with reality was what I was telling you in regard to the NO levees.
6189	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	Living in an unreal dreamworld is what is irresponsible and irrational.
6190	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And looking to a &quot;Big Brother&quot; Govt for answers is irresponsible and irrational.
6191	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	We will see, won't we?
6192	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And it is tea party, not Tea Party.
6193	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	It is many diverse groups, not a political Party.
6194	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1730	And it is the majority of America as we will see.
6195	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Sadly, Dan40, not every solution produced by the free market is ideal.
6196	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	For example, the it gave us cities with burning rivers, sucg as the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, which caught fire at least 13 times.
6197	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	It also gave us cars that were frankly rolling death traps.
6198	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	The federal government had to drag the auto industry kicking and screaming into even putting in seat belts.
6199	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	And then there were continent spanning monopolies that used ruthless business practices to crush any potential competition, such as Standard Oil.
6200	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Child labor, downright deadly working conditions, slums and poverty, I could go on for quite a while.The point is that the free market is a very powerful and efficient engine for creating material wealth, but that's *all* it does.
6201	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Both the government and the market are tools for creating a prosperous society and dealing with that society's problems.
6202	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Like all tools, each has their strengths and weaknesses, and when used appropriately compliment each other.
6203	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Historical experience has shown that neither a pure laissez-faire capitalism nor a strict command economy work particularly well in the real world.
6204	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	We need a system of checks and balances, where different institutions work toward their strengths, and keep an eye on each other.
6205	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I've been doing my best to research and reference my posts, if there's something I need to further substantiate, I apologize and ask that you please specify exactly which statement you mean.
6206	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	This is my basic argument:1 - Around the time of 2008, the US economy was on the verge of a major collapse, and faced the very real possibility of a second Great Depression.2 - Since then, the economy has moved back from the brink and improved substantially, even though the current economic situation is still far from good.3 - The first Great Depression created 25% unemployment, thousands of bank failures, and extensive homelessness in the US.I didn't think any of those was in dispute.
6207	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you take issue with them, please say so and I will track down some sources for you.4 - The Stimulus Bill has had a substantial impact on the economy, stimulating both GDP and employment.I have already provided extensive substantiation for this statement - if you need your memory refreshed, then just scroll up to my previous posts.
6208	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you still disagree with me on this point, then you either need to challenge my sources, provide sources of your own to contradict my position, or challenge some aspect of my reasoning.
6209	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Simply saying that there's no &quot;PROOF&quot; is not an argument - there's no such thing as absolute proof of anything, simply evidence in support of or against a position.
6210	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I've provided the evidence in support of my position - it's now your responsibility to provide evidence in support of yours.5 - The conclusion to be drawn is that we were in serious danger of seeing 25% unemployment, and that the stimulus helped avert this.
6211	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Therefore, saying that the stimulus should not have been passed is implying that you find running the serious risk of 25% unemployment to be preferable to the current situation with 10% unemployment.This is simple and basic logic.
6212	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you find fault with it, where, exactly?
6213	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I have never stated that 25% unemployment was certain.
6214	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	But the future never is certain.
6215	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	So again I ask, do you think risking such a drastic collapse and massive human suffering is preferable to what we have?If you're saying that pure tax cuts are much more effective at stimulating the economy then anything else, then, you know, actually make an argument for that.
6216	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Most economist say that tax cuts are one of several effective ways of stimulating the economy.
6217	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	For example, in the industry survey of economists I cited above, &quot;Panelists were asked to consider nine of the elements of the stimulus package and rank their effectiveness.
6218	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	The three ranked as most effective were infrastructure of a physical nature (roads, bridges, etc), unemployment benefits expansion, and personal tax-rate cuts.&quot;http://www.nabe.com/graphweek/2009/gw090329.htmlAs a final note, I would point out that when speaking of the Stimulus Bill as it was passed, you tend to say things such as &quot;$814,000,000,000.00 that we did not and do not have.&quot; And yet you seemed to imply that you would have supported the exact same expenditure if it had all gone to tax cuts.
6219	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Perhaps I am misunderstanding you, but it sounds very much as if you're implying that spending the money is fine, so long as you get a big piece of it.
6220	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	On what basis do you assert that government interference led to the recession?
6221	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I've heard lots of theories about the causes, although most people seem to agree that the collapse of the housing bubble and the failure to regulate the derivatives market are major factors.
6222	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	What government interference are you talking about?
6223	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	How exactly did it cause the recession?
6224	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Explain, please.Saying that politics has somehow infected business in the last few decades is frankly absurd - business and politics have gone arm in arm for time immemorial.
6225	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Eve back in the Roman Republic campaigns ran on money as much as modern ones do.
6226	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Err, if you want to make a statement, then it's your responsibility to back it up, not mine.
6227	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I'm very curious where you got the &quot;Less then 10% of the money reaching the levees&quot; figure.
6228	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you need help doing the research, PM me and I'll be happy to teach you.
6229	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	And I have to tell you, refusing to back up your statements makes it sound like you're just making it up.
6230	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Soooooo, it's a terrible thing for the federal government to do this, but if the state governments do the exact same thing, it's perfectly okay?
6231	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	O_o I'm sorry, but I really don't follow your reasoning there.
6232	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	What difference does it make if it's the feds or the states?
6233	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Ultimately it's all being paid for by tax dollars anyway.
6234	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	The federal government has much greater financial resources then any of the states, and many of the states are legally or constitutionally unable to borrow money, even in an emergency.
6235	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	It only makes sense for the level of government with the deepest pockets to do the heavy lifting during hard times.
6236	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you have a plan for fighting corruption and inefficiency, please, share!
6237	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	We need all the good ideas we can get on the subject.
6238	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	And I'm simply pointing out that it at least sounds as if your general solution to problems is to ignore them.
6239	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	If you have constructive solutions to offer, I'd very much like to hear more about them.As for &quot;Big Brother&quot;...
6240	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	Have you actually read 1984?
6241	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1731	I really don't see how there's a comparison between a government that builds roads and bridges, pays teachers, and provides unemployment insurance and a government that has video surveillance in every citizen's home, requires everyone to participate in a &quot;Daily Hate,&quot; and uses physical and psychological torture to brainwash all dissenters into believing that the government is literally omnipotent.
6242	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	You seem to love to credit or blame me for saying things I did not say.
6243	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Your liberal prejudice prevents you from reading what was written, rather you decide what you think I said.
6244	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Which makes it impossible for me to carry on an intelligent debate with you when I say things clearly and you decide I'm saying something other than that.
6245	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	So enjoy your liberal nonsense dreamland.
6246	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	If you ever bump into reality, come back and talk to me.I cannot defend what you wish I said since I did not say what you wish I said.
6247	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	And you list a litany of bad things the free market has done, but you list none of the good things it has done.
6248	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	And seat belts were not mandated by the Govt until cars already had them.
6249	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	WEARING seat belts was mandated, not installing them.
6250	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Same with padded dashes, and collapsible steering wheels and crush zones.
6251	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	All installed in cars by AUTO men while politicians were chasing hookers on European junkets.
6252	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	When real auto men got replaced by political savvy executives, more safety was mandated in cars, and the American auto industry went down the toilet.
6253	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Gas guzzlers were the order of the day, WHY?
6254	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Because it was what SOLD!
6255	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Then until the economy went to hell it was the yuppie SUV's that sold.
6256	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Amazing how tree huggers can ignore themselves driving about in a 4 ton Suburban Assault Vehicle and blame others for damaging Ma Nature.The free market has done some bad, no two ways about that.
6257	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	But it also INVENTED the 'middle class,' The free market came up with the 40 hour week, NOT unions.
6258	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Did you know that?
6259	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	And the 8 hour day, also not a union idea.Would you care to compare all the bad things that Govt has done, with all the bad the free market has done.
6260	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Or do you live on a street called ONE WAY?
6261	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Govt IS and has been, a much, much bigger problem[with no good answers] compared to the free market.And you list 1 2 3 4 5 like they were facts.
6262	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	They are NOT facts, they are liberal opinions.
6263	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	Look up the difference.
6264	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	But you will read this like I said they are wrong.
6265	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1732	They are opinions, neither right or wrong, but not facts.
6266	BigBob	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1734	Yes, I will vote in 2012, but not for my party I have been with since 18 years old!
6267	BigBob	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1734	Something sinister has taken over my party and I know it!
6268	BigBob	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1734	I will not be a part of the destruction of the America I know and love, I love this country and will be true too her!
6269	Jollee	KGB agent	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1736	Your an honest man, I hope smart too...Jollee
6270	TheTaoOfBill	KGB agent	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1737	And I refuse to vote for Putin!
6271	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	&lt;&lt;&lt; Mod Edit: Flamebaiting &gt;&gt;&gt;You say the Stimulus spending SAVED the economy.
6272	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	THAT is an opinion, not a fact.
6273	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	When I say that economies have recovered on their own.
6274	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	That IS a fact.
6275	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	But it is not saying that this present economy would have recovered on its own.
6276	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	We DO NOT know either way, that is a fact.
6277	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	My OPINION, and always stated as such, is that the Stimulus was and is a waste of money.
6278	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	When I said that IF 3.5 million jobs were created, [and my opinion is that they were not and will not be] then those jobs cost $232,000.00 each.
6279	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	Somehow you believe its OK for the Govt to &quot;create jobs&quot; at a cost of $232,000.00 Each, and also OK for the Govt to increase taxes on all those who are &quot;rich.&quot; Meaning they make over $200,000.00.
6280	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	So its OK for the Govt to 'create' jobs that cost $32,000.00 MORE than the &quot;rich line?&quot;When I said the Govt could just as well given the whole Stimulus money to the unemployed, I clearly said that is NOT an alternative suggestion.
6281	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	Yet your prejudicial interpretation blinded you to that and attempted to ridicule me for making such a suggestion.
6282	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1739	Which I did not make.So since you are unable to see or hear, or read, REALITY, and I am unable to wander in your Utopian dreamworld because reality keeps biting me on the ass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Forget it.
6283	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1741	Given the fact the economy was tanking at -7% and losing 700,000 jobs a month when the stimulus was passed and its now growing and the private sector is creating jobs, given that the bi-partisan CBO estimates that millions of jobs have been saved or created by the stimulus, it is an opinion that is well supported by fact.
6284	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1742	You statement is ALSO an opinion.And the CBO is NOT bi-partisan, unless you consider it speaking FOR the party in power to be bi-partisan.And the CBO was correct last,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WHEN??They make 10 year projections.
6285	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1742	Kindly name a CBO projection of 10 or more years vintage that is correct.
6286	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1743	Supported by facts.
6287	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1743	Sure it is. It's not controlled by the party in power
6288	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1743	You confuse projections versus reporting past events.
6289	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1744	This passes for originality in the liberal world.
6290	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1745	Just about as much as the post to which it responded.
6291	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	NET: you cannot name an accurate projection of the CBO.You may use ALL CBO projections since its inception.
6292	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	Is there a single one that proved accurate?And since there IS NOT, why should any citizen pay any attention to CBO projections.
6293	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	We know one thing about their projections from experience, IT WILL BE WRONG.The party in power GIVES the CBO the parameters they want the CBO to consider.
6294	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	The CBO simply projects on what it is given.The party in power gives the CBO a program that the party estimates will cost a trillion over 10 years.
6295	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	They tell the CBO that they will raise taxes in 8 years to get the needed trillion in funding.
6296	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	The CBO 'projects' the program to be deficit neutral.
6297	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	You know, I know, the CBO knows, dust mites in the Congressional carpet know, that no such tax increase will be passed.
6298	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	But that is not the CBO's job, the parameters say the program will be funded so the CBO projects deficit neutral.
6299	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1746	A silly sleight of hand by whichever party is in power.
6300	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1747	No one is talking about projections.
6301	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1747	Why are you?
6302	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1747	Proof that CBO estimates of job creation are based on parameters given to it by the Democrats, please.
6303	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	Talk about seeing the world through rose colored glasses.Once again you present OPINIONS AS FACTS.FACT [fækt]n1.
6304	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	a truth verifiable from experience or observation.O-PIN-ION (-pnyn)n.1.
6305	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	A belief or conclusion held with confidence but not substantiated by positive knowledge or proof:The ny times link is useless, they are an advertising agency for liberals AND they are rapidly going out of business for their stupid choice of yellow journalism.The NABE link is clearly an opinion, no FACTS in evidence.But amazingly, their OPINION is that there is a 10.3% CHANCE that the Stimulus shortened the recession.
6306	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	A 60.3% CHANCE that the Stimulus had a &quot;modest effect&quot; on shortening the recession.
6307	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	And a 29.4% CHANCE that the Stimulus had little or NO effect.
6308	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	Are you sure that's the info you wish to use to justify an expenditure of nearly a trillion dollars that we don't have?hint: CHANCE does not translate into FACT.And the link to Ben Stein's opinion.
6309	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	Did you even read it?He wrote that 3/19/10.
6310	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	Does not voice any strong support for the Stimulus then, nor strong opposition to it either.
6311	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	In any case, again, it is a opinion not a fact.
6312	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	A fact is that the economy is in almost exactly the same place today as it was on 3/19/10.
6313	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	7 months later and improvements to the economy are infinitesimally small.
6314	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	And just as good a case can be made for the Stimulus slowing the recovery as can be made for speeding it up.
6315	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	As can a case be made for NATURAL recovery taking place on its own.
6316	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	As YOUR links bear out!Obummer couldn't look up respect on Google let alone deserve ANY!
6317	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	I'll elaborate if you're confused about my opinion.
6318	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	He IS a closed minded Socialist completely lost in academic theories with no clue of practicality.
6319	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1749	But that is my considered and very experienced OPINION.
6320	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	Yeeeees, Dan, I am well aware of the difference between opinions and facts.
6321	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I also know that facts always come with some degree of doubt and uncertainty.
6322	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	And opinions aren't all created equal, and don't exist in a vacuum.
6323	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	There *are* no certainties in life, no absolutes.
6324	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	We need to weigh all the evidence in any particular case and decide what the best conclusion is based on the information available to us.
6325	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I present the evidence as I find it, and invite everyone to reach their own conclusions and present their own arguments.
6326	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I don't change the evidence to suit my point of view, and I don't cherry pick.
6327	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I change my point of view to suit the evidence.
6328	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	If you want to convince me, then show me. Show me the facts, show me your argument.I'm getting a little tired of people who say that any news source that ever presents anything they disagree with is a mouthpiece for the other side.
6329	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	And yes, there are plenty of liberals guilty of this as well.
6330	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	Any news source that doesn't challenge you and make you question your positions at least from time to time isn't a very good news source.
6331	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	In any case, in this instance, the NY Times is simply reporting on research done by Moody's et al. If you want to discount the information, it's the originator, not the reporter, you need to address.As for the NABE survey, yes you're right, it is a matter of opinion.
6332	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	The opinions of a a large number of professional economists, who study this stuff for a living.And yes, I did read Ben Stein's article.
6333	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	As I stated when I originally posted the link, the point is not that Mr Stein is giving an enthusiastic endorsement of the stimulus - clearly he is not - the point is that a very conservative economist of high standing like Mr Stein, who has criticized the stimulus on many occasions, would seem to imply that stimulus was both necessary and at least somewhat effective.&quot;But the losses to the economy following the failure of Lehman have been on the order of hundreds of billions, maybe trillions.
6334	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	Certainly the rescue and stimulus packages needed in the wake of the Lehman failure have amounted to the trillions.&quot;And if just as good a case can be made that the stimulus slowed down the recovery, then make it already.
6335	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	I must admit that I am rather puzzled by your insistence that the stimulus has hurt the economy in the face of evidence to the contrary.
6336	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	If you have evidence that supports your position, why haven't you shown us?
6337	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	And if you don't, why do you hold so steadfastly to it?And as I pointed out before, 37% of the stimulus bill was tax breaks.
6338	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1750	If it didn't help the economy, that implies that tax cuts don't help the economy.
6339	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	If you wish, you may add an additional 10,000 words, or a million more words.
6340	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	But an opinion will still be an opinion.You said 37% of the Stimulus was tax breaks.
6341	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	I have an opinion on that.
6342	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	The full amount of the Stimulus is now admitted to be $814 Billion.
6343	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	37% of that is $301,180,000,000.00.
6344	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1751	My opinion is that you should recheck your claim.
6345	jthorp24	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1752	There I fixed it for you.
6346	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	Calling my position an opinion (which it is) does not make it any less well founded or grounded in facts.
6347	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	You seem to think that if you call something an opinion, that means it's arbitrary, and you can just as legitimately take any position on the matter.
6348	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	That may be true if you're debating whether chili or stir fry is tastier.
6349	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	It's not if you're debating if the Earth is flat or round.
6350	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	And it's not when we're debating whether or not the stimulus bill helped the economy.
6351	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	Stop trying to hide behind flimsy rhetorical devices, and either show us your evidence or admit you don't have any.As for the exact numbers...
6352	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	[shrug] the nominal costs and revenues related to any legislation is **always** an estimate.
6353	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	The actual numbers can't be determined until well after the legislation has run its course - for *any* bill.
6354	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	And there will always be differences between the estimate and the actual number, that's why it's called an estimate.
6355	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1753	Your point being?
6356	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	This is your exact quote:&quot;And as I pointed out before, 37% of the stimulus bill was tax breaks.
6357	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	If it didn't help the economy, that implies that tax cuts don't help the economy.&quot;Now my eyes are not what they once were, but I do not see the word estimate anywhere.
6358	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	But if you wish to retract and now call it an estimate, OK. And I will say that $301 billion in tax breaks is a wildly insane estimate.Now can a statement be an opinion and also be true?
6359	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	Yes of course an opinion can prove true.
6360	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1754	EQUALLY true for both my opinions and yours.
6361	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1756	The stimulus bill, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is meant to create jobs and boost the economy.
6362	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1756	It cost $787 billion, including $499 billion to fund new roads, hire teachers and generally keep people employed, and about $288 billion in tax breaks to individuals and businesses.
6363	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1756	http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-me...hird-tax-cuts/288/787 = 37%.
6364	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1756	Tax cuts were 37% of the stimulus bill.
6365	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1756	It's lower if you count additional stimulus monies added since then.
6366	Jollee	sablegsd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1758	No way!
6367	Jollee	sablegsd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1758	Thats like asking me if I want America too fail!

6371	onalandline	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1761	Just being sarcastic.

6373	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	Do you not independently try to find out the TRUTH for yourselves?
6374	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	Why do I listen to both FOX and MSNBC?
6375	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	Because I want to hear both sides and decide who is lying MORE.Here are some sources for you to peruse.
6376	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	NONE of them right leaning or tea party connected:http://washingtonindependent.com/wp-...10/08/cfrb.pngfrom Bloomberg:Aug. 20 (Bloomberg) -- The Congressional Budget Office lowered its estimate for the cost of the Obama administration&#8217;s economic stimulus package to $814 billion from $862 billion.The CBO adjusted the estimate because it &#8220;revised its economic and technical assumptions,&#8221; the agency said in a report issued yesterday.This from the Washington Post, a definite liberal publication:The CBO cautioned that the the act's effects are expected to &quot;gradually diminish during the second half of 2010 and beyond,&quot; leaving the private sector to pick up the slack in an economy that is already showing signs of deteriorating rapidly.
6377	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	On the bright side,[ now THAT's FUNNY] the CBO revised the cost of the package downward: Originally estimated to cost $787 billion over 10 years, the stimulus was later estimated to cost $862 billion.
6378	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	But in the report released Tuesday, the CBO said it now expects the measure to cost only about $814 billion through 2019, with 70 percent of those costs incurred by the end of this year.
6379	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	This from the CBO itself: You will find the CBO&quot;S revised estimate of the ARRA Act &quot;Stimulus Bill&quot; on page 9.They estimate the bill to cost $787 billion at passage, revised the cost upward to $862 billion a few months later and have now settled on the lower estimate of $814.
6380	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	billion.Do you want more proof that you have no clue that your masters are lying to you?
6381	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	I could, if I wished, cite 20 to 50 more neutral sources.
6382	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	But you'd be better off doing some REAL RESEARCH, and learning on your own.
6383	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1763	Your misconceptions have become a bore.Would you please start learning what is really happening in our country or STFU.
6384	Jollee	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1764	Jollee the PEOPLE OF THE USA are the only entity that you can trust, unfortunately!Jollee
6385	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	WRONG again.
6386	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Misinterpreting an opinion as a fact.
6387	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	It says it is EXPECTED that the effects will be diminishing over time.
6388	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	That ASSUMES there was an effect, it does not prove ANYTHING.
6389	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Is English NOT you native language?The report of the CBO neither proves there was or proves there was not an effect caused by the stimulus.
6390	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Remember many many economic downturns have happened throughout our history.
6391	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Some had some kind of Govt intervention, others had NO intervention whatsoever.
6392	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	ALL eventually recovered, NONE had a Stimulus Bill.
6393	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	The one with the most Govt intervention was the Depression.
6394	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	With massive and unrelenting Govt intervention, the depression lasted from the early 30's until the END OF WWII.
6395	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Some help!When the Stimulus was passed, THAT DAY, I predicted that the recession just got extended by 2 years minimum.
6396	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Now 21 months later, the economy is still all but FLAT.
6397	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Was my prediction correct?
6398	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1766	Not yet, but we're getting there.And when this recession really does end, you may ABSOLUTELY count on unpleasant inflation.
6399	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	[Looks amused] So you're happy to quote the CBO when you feel it's supporting your position, but when I point out it's actually doing the opposite, it suddenly becomes an opinion?
6400	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Yes, yes, I know you're just trying to turn my own liberal brainwashing propaganda against me, or some such.
6401	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	(Incidentally, that's sarcasm, and not intended as a serious representation of your position.
6402	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	And are the shouting and personal insults really necessary?
6403	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	They really don't strengthen your argument at all, you know.)And as I've already explained, there's no such thing as absolute proof, and any single piece of evidence certainly doesn't &quot;prove&quot; anything.
6404	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	But when multiple lines of evidence all point to the same thing, you can have a pretty good amount of confidence in that conclusion.
6405	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	And so far all the evidence is pointing to the Stimulus Bill having helped the economy.And yes, you are right that the economy will almost certainly completely recover on its own.
6406	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	But I don't think that's a reason to not use the tools at our disposal to help the situation.Some historical corrections: Obama's stimulus policy has been pretty much the same as that used by Presidents of both parties in every recession since the Great Depression.
6407	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	The details vary, but the overall strategy is the same - cut taxes, extend unemployment benefits, increase spending, do whatever's necessary to get money flowing again.The Great Depression is generally considered to have lasted from 1929 until the start of WWII, not the end.
6408	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	The Depression hit its lowest point in 1933, and after that began a slow but steady improvement.
6409	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Economic conditions had improved a lot by 1937, when the conservative coalition convinced FDR that the economy had improved enough that it was time to return to a more normal policy.
6410	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	New Deal programs were rolled back, taxes increased, and spending cut to try to balance the federal budget.
6411	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	The result was a second crash, where industrial production fell almost 30% in a few months, and unemployment went from 14.3% in 1937 to 19.0% in 1938.And no, your prediction has proven to be wrong.
6412	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Right now the economy is stagnant, not in recession.
6413	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Things aren't good, but they're not getting worse.
6414	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	True, that makes little difference to the folks who are out of work, but the economy booming makes little difference to someone out of work.
6415	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Just to clarify, flat = stagnant, going down = recession, going up = recovery.To sum up, as bad as things are now, all the evidence indicates that without the Stimulus Bill, things would be appreciably worse.
6416	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	As for the policies being advocated by the Republicans...
6417	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	As far as I can tell, they are saying they want to cut taxes and balance the budget.
6418	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Setting aside for the moment that in order to balance the budget, you'll realistically have to raise taxes *and* cut spending, those policies are an awful lot like the ones that Hoover followed at the beginning of the Depression, and that the conservatives coalition convinced FDR to try in 1937.
6419	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1767	Balancing the budget will be a short term hit to the economy - it always has been.
6420	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	REALITY is all the strength my arguments needs.
6421	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	And at no time and in no way have I attempted to use CBO statements as facts.
6422	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Making that error is strictly your domain.
6423	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Whether I agree with anything the CBO says or not, does not in any way assign factual credence to their opinions/projections.
6424	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	I ALWAYS know their reports are conjecture, not fact.
6425	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	When you agree with them, suddenly they are stating facts.
6426	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	That's silly.Unemployment remains at 9.6% for September.
6427	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Essentially FLAT for all of 2010.
6428	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Talk about your phantom 'recovery' to those people.Read the entire BLS report.
6429	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Especially the part that says that those no longer counted as unemployed because they have stopped looking for a job is now 503,000 higher than September 2009, WHEN THAT FIGURE WAS 697,000.
6430	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	Its now 1,200,000.
6431	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1768	The Stimulus is serving them well, is it not?Perhaps I should point out that these are statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and are supposed to be facts, not opinions, since you seem to have great difficulty with the distinctions.
6432	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1769	Flat might not be much of a recovery.
6433	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1769	But it's not a recession either.
6434	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1769	In fact it's leaning more towards recovery than recession because we are growing.
6435	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1769	We're just not growing at a fast enough rate.
6436	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1770	And what proof do liberals have that our very slow, almost non-existent &quot;recovery&quot; in not caused by natural recovery as HAS happened many times in the past.
6437	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1770	Is it Stimulus OR is it wounds healing on their own?
6438	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1770	Neither you nor I can PROVE either premise to be true or false.oBum is first to point out that, &quot;IT'S NOT MY FAULT.&quot; No matter what the question.
6439	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1770	So maybe the recovery, what little there is of it, is not his &quot;fault,&quot; either.
6440	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	No proof is needed.
6441	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	It's a basic understanding the stimulus spending increases consumer demand and thus results in shorter recession.Yes the economy theoretically could have recovered on it's own.
6442	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	But there is no way that after a financial collapse and a collapse of the 3 largest job produces, the auto companies, we would have been out of the recession less than 2 years after it started.
6443	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	It is just economically impossible for the recession to end in less than 2 years without government assistance.
6444	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	In no previous example where we've had a complete financial failure and a major industry failure at the same time and it has recovered on it's own in less than 2 years.
6445	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	That just doesn't happen.
6446	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	It's not possible to do.
6447	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	Government intervention ended the recession faster and thus saved us money.
6448	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1771	I don't know why you are so against saving money.
6449	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	And fires will go out on their own also.
6450	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	But we usually think its best douse them with water to reduce the overall damage.I predicted 2 years ago that if the Economy recovered, Conservatives would say it would have done so faster without the stimulas.If the Obama Administration hadn't pushed the stimulas plan and the economy was 4 times worse than it is now, the few of us still with jobs would be blaming his administration.I do know that 2 years ago, my 401k was half the size it is now, people were wondering whether GM would survive the year, whether the entire banking industry would go under, and how far housing prices would tumble.
6451	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	There was panic in the air.Now there is no more panic.
6452	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	The banking industry is stable, GM is working, housing prices have largely stabilized and industry is picking up- slowly.
6453	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	Perfect?
6454	SFJEFF	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1772	No. But this recession was years in the making, and its recovery will not happen overnight.
6455	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	So we should have squirted water on the economy?
6456	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Or throw money at forest fires?
6457	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Or can we make arguments that are not pure nonsense.
6458	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	YES, water on fires.
6459	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	NO the economy is not a fire.
6460	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	And I predicted that the economy would take longer to recover due to Govt INTERFERENCE.
6461	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Well the economy HAS NOT recovered.
6462	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	So much for your 'prediction.'
6463	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	The majority of us with open minds ARE blaming his &quot;administration.&quot; You, and he, should have noticed that but so far you haven't.
6464	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Nov.3 might be a wake up call.
6465	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	I have a number of investments that are still below their peak, well below.And GM did not survive.
6466	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	GM went bankrupt and was WRONGLY bailed out by the Govt.
6467	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	GM paid back the bailout money from the $50 billion in stock that the taxpayers bought without agreeing to buy.
6468	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	That stock is today worth 75 CENTS a share.
6469	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	There is a plan to reissue &quot;real&quot; GM stock in an IPO soon.
6470	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	If that IPO does not generate high participation and prices.
6471	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	We, the taxpayers, stand to lose most or substantial parts of that $50 Billion.
6472	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	I DO have to agree with you about PANIC.
6473	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	But it was panic by politicians of both parties, led by Democrats.
6474	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Democrats passed both the TARP and the Stimulus.
6475	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	The TARP had Republican help.
6476	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	The Stimulus was a purely Democrat panic.
6477	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	And panic was what they both were and are.
6478	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	TARP was $700 Billion to purchase or insure sub prime bundled non-secure &quot;securities.&quot; Odd since Fannie &amp; Freddie insured those &quot;securities&quot; even before the bubble burst.
6479	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	We didn't buy the securities, we lent the money to the banks.
6480	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Why was it panic by the politicians?
6481	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	We only put out about half the $700 Billion.
6482	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	That shows the knee jerk panic.
6483	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	And we will lose just under $100 Billion on the deal when its all said and done.The Stimulus panic, pretty much the same.
6484	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Much was to go to 'shovel ready' projects.
6485	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	It went to bailing out Democrat states debts.
6486	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	It has been added to numerous times and now totals over a Trillion Dollars.
6487	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Much remains unspent.
6488	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Could the Stimulus be responsible for any private sector jobs?
6489	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Yes, the Stimulus &quot;COULD&quot; be responsible for a number of private sector jobs.
6490	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Is there any actual proof that the Stimulus is responsible for even one private sector job?
6491	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	NO.What we do have is the FACT that we are now in the slowest recovery since the Great Depression.
6492	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Not a very Stimulating Stimulus, is it?
6493	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	I again agree, this recession was many DECADES in the making and wholly the fault of bad legislation passed by both Republicans and Democrats over many years.
6494	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	So YES the recovery will take a long time.
6495	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1773	Expecting those who caused it [politicians] to fix it is just stupid.
6496	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1774	We are not growing.
6497	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1774	Take off the glasses.
6498	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1776	So we pass $700 Billion in TARP and over $1 Trillion in Stimulus to get a &quot;LEAN.&quot; The LIEN we got is AGAINST the countries future.
6499	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1777	You're (*)(*)(*)(*) (*)(*)(*)(*)ing straight we did!
6500	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1777	And we saved trillions doing it!
6501	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1777	Do you know how much a long drawn out recession costs this country!?
6502	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1777	Why are you so against saving money!
6503	Sassy	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1778	All the Boehner Republicans promise is more of NeoCon Bratboy/Cheney egotistic, military saber rattling in the name of &quot;the WAR on terror!&quot; when Iraq was a simplistic power grab to corner and dominate the oil market fueled by a economic policy of greed that redistributed the wealth earned by stealing jobs from the working class middle American to feed the gluttony of the of the top 2% Republican oligarchy striving to turn the world into their own version of the United Business Nations; and the deluded tea party Republicans who wrap themselves in the stars and stripes, carry guns to rallies to convince themselves they are in tune with the American Constitution they not only don't understand but probably have never read.
6504	Sassy	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1778	It is obvious from the home made signs at their hate filled rallies that they get their Constitution &quot;education&quot; from a Mr. MaGoo-like, Glenn Beck, the cry baby synthetic Mormon whose shriveled brain is fried from alcohol and drug abuse, much like his mentor and collaborator, Rush Limbaugh.
6505	Sassy	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1778	These guys are so charismatic and appealing they turn &quot;red-necks&quot; and &quot;bimbos&quot; into the elite.Republicans haven't a clue or produced one as to how to get this country out of a &quot;depression/recession&quot; other than to bombastically whine about and with shrill, moronic complaints about how &quot;slow&quot; the Democrats are at it.
6506	Sassy	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1778	In point of fact, all Republicans know how to do is to drive the country into a recession (Hoover, Reagan/Bush and now Bratboy).
6507	Sassy	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1778	They are the least competent to devise a plan to get our country out of one.
6508	TheTaoOfBill	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1780	She didn't say those exact words of course.
6509	TheTaoOfBill	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1780	But she did claim that Alaska's proximity to Russia gives her foreign policy experience.
6510	TheTaoOfBill	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1780	(Which of course it does no such thing)
6511	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1781	Palin was a Mayor of an Alaskan city.
6512	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1781	Palin was the Governor of Alaska.
6513	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1781	Both are executive positions.
6514	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1781	Maybe not &quot;big Time&quot; executive positions, but still executive positions.Did you note the BH Obama had not one second of experience at any type of executive position in his life?
6515	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1781	Nor had he had one second of experience at anything approaching an executive position.And since Jan. 09, it is painfully obvious that he was NOT ready for the job, and it is equally obvious that he is NOT learning on the job.
6516	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	One with only a few thousand people.
6517	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	And she left it in massive amounts of debt.
6518	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Yeah.
6519	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	And she couldn't take the pressure of the job and quit.
6520	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Her sudden resignation cost the state hundreds of thousands.
6521	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Her experience includes being a failed mayor and a quitter governor.
6522	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	If that's your best defense for Palin then that's sad.
6523	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Actually he was incharge of a large staff when he was community organizer and he was the president of the Harvard Law Review.
6524	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	Those are two executive position.
6525	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	And regardless he is now president of the united states.
6526	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1782	He now has more executive experience in his pinky than Palin has in her entire failure of a career.

6530	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1783	The recession is not over regardless of whatever silliness liberal academics wish to claim.With regularity and stealth, both the CBO and the BLS keep DOWNGRADING their previous conclusions to less growth and fewer jobs.
6531	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1783	Quietly they revise their earlier OVERSTATEMENTS downward.

6533	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1783	And I consider both the CBO and the BLS to be liberal biased sources.
6534	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1784	Even the Wall Street Journal...a conservative leaning business news report...

6549	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1786	It ended by the textbook definition of what a recession is. A shrinking economy.

6556	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1788	In other words unemployment stays high long after a recession has ended.
6557	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1788	And the debt increases in prosperity periods as well.
6558	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	So you are an advocate of borrowing and spending one's way out of debt.
6559	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	Good luck with that.
6560	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	There is a Hurricane named INFLATION heading for your wallet.Here is an interesting graph from the same Govt Agency that calculates the GDP.http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/GovView.asp.Please note the widening gap between income and expenditures of the US Govt.
6561	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	The gap noticeably widens with the installation of the Democrat controlled Congress in Jan 2007 and widens much more under the reckless spending of obummer.Yes BUSH spent way too much too.
6562	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	But this shows that against income he was a miser compared to &quot;Riverboat Barak.&quot;It also cracks me up that liberals wish to blame Bush for the expenditures through 9/30/2009, the end of the last Bush fiscal year.
6563	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1789	But want to credit obummer for all the imagined 'good' that happened between Jan 20 09 and 9/30/09.

6567	Dan40	We report you decide?	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1792	If you had the intelligence to watch them, you'd know they are the most fair network on TV.

6592	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	As long as demand is low we are pretty much immune from inflation.
6593	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	And when demand starts to pick up again then all it will take is for the fed to raise interest rates to keep inflation under control.

6598	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	That is to be expected.

6600	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	The very clear problem is the sudden drop in revenue.

6602	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	Because democrats know how to pay the bills.

6604	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1795	And thus our revenue plummeted and we lost hundreds of billions of dollars.

6624	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1800	Now, Congress must ensure that old flame isn't rekindled.A new Government Accountability Office report nonsensically concludes that the funding ban doesn't apply to Affordable Housing Centers of America (AHCOA), formerly ACORN Housing Corp., which occupies ACORN's former Philadelphia offices.
6625	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1800	This, despite GAO previously saying ACORN Housing received about 1 million taxpayer dollars -- and Housing and Urban Development's inspector general urging &quot;inactive status&quot; for AHCOA until questions about its handling of previous federal grants are settled.U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., wants Congress to &quot;legislatively clarify that AHCOA should not receive any federal funding.&quot;ACORN's Washington sweethearts must think taxpayers -- and lawmakers -- have awfully short memories.

6628	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	Which is, of course, perfectly fine, but it's really better not to mix the two up.You should *never* get your information from just one source, no matter how trusted.
6629	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	Even the best of us make mistakes from time to time.
6630	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	I think the best strategy is to use several centrists sources.
6631	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	The sources on both extremes seem to have little compunction about distorting information, or even out right lying.As for Mr Beck...
6632	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	I've listened to his radio show once.
6633	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	(This does also mean I'm not really in a good position to make an assessment of him overall.)
6634	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	And in that program, I heard him make one statement in particular that... well, I don't know if it was a deliberate lie or just blazing stupidity.
6635	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	He was complaining about an American history textbook he had recently come across.
6636	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	He made several points about the book, and some seemed well founded to me, but he then went on to site a passage in the book which said something about the US's founding fathers &quot;furthering&quot; the ideals of democracy.
6637	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1801	He denounced the use of the word &quot;furthering&quot; with incredulity repeatedly, leaving the impression that the US invented democracy.I don't know what Mr Beck's thinking behind such a statement was, but it was certainly bizarre, and left an extremely poor impression with me.
6638	jthorp24	losttexan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1804	Can't be serious...
6639	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1805	Obama is a good man who's policies are saving America.
6640	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1805	What's not to love...?
6641	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	Once again you present your opinions as factual and berate me for stating my opinion.
6642	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	IF you were fully aware of all my posts in re: media sources, you would know that I have never heard even a second of Beck's radio show and have never watched his TV show from start to finish.
6643	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	You would also know that I read liberal papers and watch liberal &quot;news&quot; sources, including Keith and Chris.
6644	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	Each are so radical they make Beck seem like a shy lamb.I listen to both sides, research what each side has to say, double check the research sources for their agendas, and weigh it all against my 7 decades of experience in life and starting and running multi-million dollar businesses.
6645	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	What I have stated is that FOX IS right leaning but is the most fair network on the air.
6646	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	They more than ANY other news source present BOTH sides of an issue.
6647	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	They REGULARLY have on very far left liberals to present the liberal view.
6648	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	And they do not demonize the liberal view, nor marginalize it as liberals constantly do to the conservative views.
6649	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	FOX does not have, nor does it care to have any words to use against liberals like &quot;teabaggers.&quot;I present here MY opinions, not FOX's opinions.And I'll stack my opinions up against yours using NEUTRAL sources at any time.Here is something that is a fact.
6650	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	FOX is outselling every one of the liberal slanted news sources.
6651	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	FOX is making money while NBC et al. is loosing viewers and the NYTimes and others are looking at bankruptcy.
6652	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	Liberals and Democrats attribute that to the public being stupid.
6653	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	Well my OPINION is that the public is actually very smart and the public has seen through the liberal nonsense.
6654	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	The upcoming elections are the proof.
6655	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	The Republican and 'teabagger' challengers are running on the issues of too big Govt and too much spending.
6656	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1806	While the Democrats are begging the free ride parasites to get out and vote for Dems or lose their free ride on people that actually have ambitions and goals,.
6657	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1807	You know there are sources of information that are neither liberal or conservative.
6658	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1807	But in general I've seen you label those sources as liberally biased simply because they go against your world view and ideology.
6659	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	I do not accept NOR USE biased sources.
6660	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	Since I do not use conservative sources against liberals, I do not accept liberal sources against conservatives.Your opinion of an unbiased source is one that is not radically far left.
6661	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	My opinion is one that is as neutral as possible in either direction.When I cite a source like the Bureau of Labor Statistics and get a rebuttal from a liberal using a source like MoveOn.org.
6662	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	I laugh at the tragicomic stupidity of that liberal.
6663	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1809	Both for attempting to use that source and for believing any words on that site.
6664	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1810	What policies are SAVING America?
6665	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1810	America is built on freedom and capitalism.

6667	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1810	Turning America into a socialist country is hardly saving America...
6668	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1810	It's destroying it.
6669	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	You know, Dan, this constant harping on fact and opinion is really starting to irritate me. You seem to think that you can label my positions as opinions, that all opinions are equally valid, and that therefore your position cannot be refuted.
6670	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	That's a load of BS, and frankly, I'm insulted that you'd try to hide behind such a transparent rationalization.
6671	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	In the real world, the line between opinion and fact is not as absolute as you like to imply.
6672	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	There is *always* some uncertainty in *any* information, and ultimately *anything* can be characterized as an opinion.
6673	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	The law of gravity is an opinion, since you have to take as accurate the information supporting it.
6674	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	The same with the germ theory of disease.
6675	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	Or the idea that the Earth is a giant sphere floating in space.
6676	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	It's an opinion that you can see the upper portions of an approaching ship at sea first because of the curvature of the earth.
6677	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	It's an opinion that all the photographs of the Earth from space aren't faked.
6678	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	It's an opinion that GPS uses satellites, and not some mechanism that's kept secret to conceal that the Earth is actually flat.So unless you want to join the tinfoil beanie crowd, quit trying to pretend that all opinions are equal.
6679	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	They aren't, and it's inane, insulting, and just plain childish to keep saying they are.
6680	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1811	And frankly, if the only way you can challenge my positions is by trying to use an underhanded yet pathetically transparent rhetorical trick, you're as much as admitting that I'm right.
6681	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Just to pick one insanely DUMB thing out of the Health Insurance Bill.
6682	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Deficit neutral??????????
6683	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Since passage the CBO has revised the costs UPWARD a few times already and we are at the barest beginning.
6684	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	It will cost, according to the CBO just about a TRILLION dollars.
6685	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	That will be paid for in mandated coverage[being challenged in 20 lawsuits now with more to come], increased taxes, and by taking $500,000,000,000.00 out of Medicare.
6686	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	So HALF the funding of obamacare is to come from the insurance coverage that covers the people that will need it the most.
6687	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Where is the logic in that?
6688	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Plus we are talking about over 50 million Seniors, and those Seniors VOTE.
6689	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	obamacare does not specify where and how HALF A TRILLION dollars will be taken from Medicare, But I'm willing to bet that no politician seeking another term EVER is going to vote to take away HEALTH CARE from 50+ million seniors that vote.I predict here and now that obamacare, if allowed to proceed, will incur a 10 year cost well in excess of $5,000,000,000,000.00 $5 Trillion dollars.
6690	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	And I further predict not not only will half a trillion dollars NOT come from Medicare, but the Medicare funding will INCREASE.50+ million voters will not be angered.That is only one aspect of obamacare.
6691	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	Another is increased coverage without underwriting is not possible without large premium increases and liberal politicians are well aware of that FACT, not opinion.
6692	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	They are planning to do a &quot;correction&quot; sometime in the future that will screw the country royally, or they are more stupid than we can believe.HOW is it that insurance companies have been regulated by politicians for all of your life and before, yet they are screwing the public.
6693	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	And how is insurance companies being regulated under obamacare going to be any different.Before obamacareInsurance companies could NOTCancel an in force policy except for non payment of premiums.Cancel a policy because someone got sick.Raise an individual's premium for any reason, sickness, age, whatever.These regulations existed before obamacare and were &quot;enforced&quot; by elected or appointed politicians.
6694	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1812	obamacare changes nothing in this area.And before you argue with me, look it all up on State Govt websites under Insurance Commissioners or Insurance Regulators.
6695	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	How about preventing a second Great Depression?
6696	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	That doesn't qualify as saving the US?
6697	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	And socialism does not exclude freedom *or* democracy.Actually, I'm curious, why exactly are we arguing about labels from a nineteenth century ideological debate?
6698	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	Surely we've learned something about how to run an economy and a society in general in the last two centuries.
6699	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1813	Such as that neither a pure laissez-faire capitalist system nor a strict command economy work terribly well in the real world.
6700	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1814	We are in a depression, well I think everyone can at least agree that we are in a recession.
6701	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1814	What did he do to save it?
6702	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1814	It wasn't like he waved a wand of anything.
6703	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1815	Who says we are in a depression?
6704	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1815	Rush?
6705	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1815	Sean?
6706	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	The Great Depression in the US saw 25% unemployment, thousands of bank failures, and large numbers of Americans forced to live in shanty towns called Hoovervilles.
6707	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	You tell me, jthorpe, does that sound like what's going on today?
6708	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	The economy right now is stagnant, not in recession.
6709	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	It's bad, but at least not getting worse.
6710	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	And certainly a lot better then it was two years ago.
6711	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	And no, President Obama didn't wave a wand - he got the stimulus passed.
6712	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	And as we've already examined in detail in this thread, the stimulus *did* help the economy, and things *would* have been worse without it.
6713	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1816	(Yes, Dan, we know you completely disagree with this, no need to repeat yourself.)
6714	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	Sorry but I will not let you get away with stating an opinion as a fact.
6715	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	Your OPINION and obummer's opinion and his Harvard economists opinions are that 700,000 jobs, or 2 million jobs or 3.5 million jobs have been &quot;SAVED&quot; [an absolute bullsh!t term] or created since the Stimulus.
6716	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	None of those numbers are provable.
6717	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	When tried, even the liberal media stated that they were vastly overstated.But whatever number you wish to opine, fine.There is also a group of economists that believe that 2 million jobs have been LOST since the Stimulus was passed.Your opinion would disagree with their opinion.
6718	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	I actually do not have an opinion on which side is correct or most accurate.
6719	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	What I see with my own eyes is businesses closed up.
6720	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	Chain restaurants with multi-promotions and lower prices.

6722	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	With all the talk about foreclosure paperwork problems, obama said he does not support a moratorium on foreclosures.
6723	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1817	That is the single wise economic statement he has made since taking office.
6724	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1818	Actually its the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office's estimate.
6725	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1818	Not Obama's or his team's.
6726	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	You don't have an opinion?
6727	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	Bull.
6728	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	You couldn't have made your opinion any clearer if you'd rented every billboard in Times Square.
6729	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	At least have the decency and courage to stand by your own position.So tell me, who exactly are these economists?
6730	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	Let's see some names, some quotes.
6731	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	If you're going to cite someone, actually cite them.
6732	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	Yes, it's an opinion that the Stimulus helped the economy.
6733	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	And I and others here have provided ample evidence to support it.
6734	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	You've even inadvertently provided supporting evidence yourself.
6735	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	And despite being challenged many times, you have yet to provide a single shred of evidence to the contrary.
6736	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	I really fail to see how any other conclusion can be reasonably reached or supported.
6737	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	Yeees, Dan, as *everyone* agrees, the economy sucks.
6738	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	No one says any different, the situation is bad.
6739	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	But it could be a heck of a lot worse.
6740	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	We're nowhere near the levels of misery seen in the Great Depression.
6741	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	The stimulus has helped.
6742	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	How bad would things be now if President Obama had done nothing, just sat back and watched?
6743	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	No one knows for certain, but I, for one, am glad we didn't have to find out the hard way.---------On a lighter note...I'm working on getting back to you about health care reform, but it's kind of annoying having to track down the insurance regulations of every state.
6744	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	[mutters] 50 different sets of regulations for one country, this is why the states rights people are mad.
6745	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	[j/k] LOL It *is* kind of a pain, tho.
6746	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1819	But I will get back to you on it.
6747	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	As ALWAYS you tell me what I meant!
6748	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Get over yourself.I said I don't have an opinion on who is right on creating or losing jobs, because I do not have an opinion on who is right.
6749	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	I'm sure that any jobs created are not as numerous as the admin and its cronies claim, and I'm sure that the jobs lost figure is at least somewhat inflated by the admin's POLITICAL opponents.I have the opinion that the Stimulus was unnecessary and has extended the recovery by 2 years or more.
6750	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	And the only opinion I have about pro or con politicians, and jobs losses or gains, is that neither is overly concerned with the truth.
6751	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	And whom did you quote other than administration cronies?
6752	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Do you want me to quote ultra conservatives.
6753	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Or are you claiming that there are no ultra conservatives saying the Stimulus lost jobs?
6754	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Why name names when I do not put any faith in the accuracy of either side?
6755	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	And you already know, or should, that there are opponents with contrary opinions.
6756	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	You inability to see anything does not in any way change conjecture into fact.
6757	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	But you do LOVE to state your opinions as facts.
6758	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	---------Yes, it could be worse and yes it could be better.
6759	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	History may tell us which, since currents events only show what is happening with massive Govt intervention.
6760	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	And massive Govt intervention IS what caused the recession in the first place.
6761	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Relying on the same idiots[politicians, not just liberals] to fix the problems THEY caused is about as far from wisdom as we can get.
6762	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Just as Wall Street and the banking industry were HEAVILY REGULATED by politicians LONG BEFORE the financial &quot;crisis.&quot; So was the insurance industry even MORE heavily regulated long before, many decades, before obamacare.
6763	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Insurance companies were heavily regulated long before obama was even born.A few moments of clear thinking ought to make you say, &quot;Of course!&quot; &quot;How could they NOT have been regulated all these years.&quot; Besides simple logic, it is also FACT.
6764	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Each year, TRILLIONS of dollars pass through both Wall Street and insurance companies.
6765	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Do you think ANY politician, liberal, conservative, Democrat, Republican, Independent, Whig, or any other group would ever ignore any industry handling TRILLIONS of dollars?
6766	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	EVEN for a DAY?
6767	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1820	Let alone a hundred years?
6768	onalandline	losttexan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1821	Yeah, because Obama is really helping Seniors.
6769	TheTaoOfBill	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1822	At least you can count on him not privatizing social security.
6770	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1823	But you can count on him raising prices for health care.
6771	Agent Zero	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1824	Surely private insurers would never do such a thing.
6772	jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	Key word... private.
6773	jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	Not government.
6774	jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	It's what they have to when a bunch of people who can't pay for healthcare, get it paid for by others.
6775	jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	Redistribution of wealth at it's finest.
6776	jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1825	Undeserving people riding the system on the $ of others.
6777	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1826	Not necessarily.
6778	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1826	There are 20 states repealling Obama care and the case is going to be heard.Take a look at this:http://www.silobreaker.com/judge-dec...81518310637623
6779	jthorp24	Agent Zero	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1827	
6780	jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1827	I sure hope this happens.
6781	jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1827	Especially since I live in Michigan.
6782	jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1827	I remember hearing this soon after it originally passed, but since I haven't really heard anything of it.
6783	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	Sorry, I did not realize my first post was botched up.
6784	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	It's one of those links where you keep clicking on them and I just fixed my post.I heard it on the news last night from one of the attorneys that are on this case.
6785	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	He had some good points on why he thinks this could go to the Supreme Court.
6786	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	I think most people are concerned about Medicare cuts and the Cap &amp; tax part of the bill.
6787	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1828	I am not altogether sure.
6788	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	So it's perfectly okay if large numbers of people are given the shaft so long as it's done by private companies?
6789	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	If people are driven into bankruptcy, denied health care, that's fine so long as someone's getting rich off of it?
6790	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	Personally.
6791	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	given the choice between having my health care administered by a private company that's unaccountable to anyone and has a profit motive to sit back and watch me suffer and die, and having it administered by a government agency that's ultimately accountable to the voters, I'll take the government.And how exactly do you decide who's undeserving?
6792	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	If someone is poor they must obviously be that way because they're lazy or stupid or just generally a bad person, is that it?
6793	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	You should be careful about saying that people deserve whatever they can squeeze out of the system.
6794	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	The real law of the jungle means *no* holds barred, period.
6795	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	A large part of the government's job is to level the playing field and ensure that everyone plays by the rules.
6796	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	Even Hammurabi said four millennia ago that he was given his throne &quot;so that the strong should not harm the weak.&quot; And we all benefit by living in a society where the government actually does a half decent job of it.
6797	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	Taxes are the price of living in a civilized society.
6798	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1829	I find it interesting that many of the same people who complain about people getting government benefits having a sense of entitlement seem to feel entitled themselves to the benefits of that civilized society without having to pay for it.
6799	Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	It's boils down to what is constitutional in the bill.
6800	Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	Private insurers will have much more say in what tests and procedures are approved in regards to your health care.
6801	Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	There is a panel who will make these decisions regarding your care in the Democratic bill that Congress passed.
6802	Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	Now concerning the cost and I am no economic major.
6803	Jiyuu-Freedom	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1830	I do see where this is absolutely ludicrous.
6804	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	Rich people shouldn't be entitled to pay for anyones health care that is the problem.
6805	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	Healthcare is a service not a right.
6806	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	You don't have any right to someone else's money.
6807	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	You don't have the right to someone else's service.
6808	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	It's just an anomaly to think you are entitled to healthcare from a doctor.
6809	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	So if I want my lawn cared for...
6810	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	I should be entitled to someone else's service?
6811	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	Even if I can't afford it?
6812	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1831	The rich should pay for it?
6813	jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1832	I just can't get over how people think we are going to insure millions of new americans and it is going to lower the overall cost of healthcare.
6814	jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1832	It's just a lack of logic.
6815	jthorp24	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1832	Nothing more than a bunch of sheep listening to their Messiah.
6816	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	Yes, and I failed to mention in my post that the Dems think it will actually reduce the deficit by $131 billion over 10 years.
6817	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	We need someone to do the math here.
6818	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	Have they mentioned the amount of tax revenue they plan to come up with?
6819	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	Not that I have heard.
6820	Jiyuu-Freedom	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1833	Anyone?

6822	Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	IF all that is done, the CBO originally said obamacare would be deficit neutral over 10 years.
6823	Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	But the CBO has already revised their cost estimate upward a couple of times and the program hasn't even started.So the politicians seeking re-election each year will have to publicly VOTE on the higher taxes each year, and those taxes will have to be higher than the first estimates.
6824	Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	So the tax funding is unlikely.The premiums or penalty funding is already being challenged in 20 different court tests and WILL end up in the SCOTUS.And last, which re-election seeking politician from any party will take a dime from the 50+ million VOTING seniors on Medicare.
6825	Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	It ain't gonna happen.So as usual a Govt program WILL cost 5 or more TIMES more than first estimated, [it happens all the time, and the opposite NEVER happens] and the tax funding WILL fall WAY short.
6826	Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	The premium or penalty part will be found unconstitutional, so ZERO funding from that nonsense.
6827	Dan40	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1834	And the Medicare dollars will never exist.If not repealed in 2013, when obama is sent back to re-organize ACORN in Chicago, the &quot;health insurance expansion bill&quot; will cost in excess of $5 TRILLION UNFUNDED DOLLARS.
6828	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	Sadly, jthorp, a social contract involves both rights and responsibilities.
6829	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	Like it or not, we are all part of one community, and all have a responsibility to make that community work.
6830	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	And ignoring the needs of a large segment of the population is one of the best ways I can think of to tear that community apart.We all benefit from living in a prosperous, peaceful society.
6831	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	Tell me, just how rich would the rich be if we couldn't count on the lights coming on when we flip the switch, clean water coming out of the tap, trash being whisked away, police and courts to protect us, and so on and so on?
6832	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	An awful lot of that prosperity is due to the productive and technological capital that we've been building up for many many generations.
6833	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	How can any of us claim a special right to the legacy of our ancestors?
6834	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	We all rely on it, whether we realize it or not.If you really want to just sit back and watch while people suffer and die, you're both immoral and a fool.
6835	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	If those on the bottom of the socio-economic ladder are kept impoverished with precious little real chance of advancement, what incentive do they have to buy into society?
6836	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	And if large numbers of people stop buying into society, it's just going to fall apart.
6837	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	It's just plain flat out in the best interest of the wealthy to look after the lower classes, as well as being the only decent and moral thing to do.We live in an extraordinarily wealthy society, and we have both the ability and the responsibility to care for everyone.And before I hear the usual platitudes about hard work and personal responsibility...
6838	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	Personal responsibility is very important.
6839	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	So is collective responsibility.
6840	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	We ignore either at our peril.
6841	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	And as admirable and necessary as hard work is, saying that all of society's ills would be solved if only everyone would work hard enough is naive.
6842	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	If all it takes is hard work to reach the pinnacle of society, why is anyone poor?
6843	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1835	The fact is that not that many people manage to move really dramatically on the socio-economic scale.
6844	Jollee	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1836	No! I will be for the Chamber of Commerce, who promotes small business and hiring!@
6845	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	At what point is your wholly imaginary &quot;social responsibility&quot; met?
6846	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Today the top 25% of wealth pays 86.6% of our income tax and the next 27% pays the remaining 13.4% of our income tax.
6847	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Leaving 47% of the nation that TAKES out, rather than paying IN anything.We have a fiscal responsibility to fund the operations of the Govt.
6848	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	We do not have a social responsibility to support those that will not support themselves.CHARITY is there for that, Charity is the means for those that wish to exercise their own imagined &quot;social responsibility.&quot; And charity is encouraged through tax deductiblity.
6849	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	If you want more charity, work for more charitable tax deductions.
6850	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	What came first, the chicken or the egg?
6851	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Most all of what you cite above is a direct result of A PERSON deciding to INVEST, at great personal risk to themselves, their time, ideas, brainpower, future, and money.
6852	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Part of their decision might have been their genius, or their simple desire to improve something, but part was also for their own personal gain.
6853	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	The &quot;poor&quot; benefit from their accomplishments in technology and productivity.
6854	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Is it too much to ask that the investor that made it possible, enjoy the lion's share of their accomplishments without being vilified?
6855	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	&quot;Suffer and DIE&quot;?????????
6856	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	That is next to non-existent in the USA.
6857	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Our &quot;poor&quot; are those families of 4 making $22,000.00 per year or less and our &quot;rich&quot; are those making $200,000.00 or more per year.
6858	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Both POLITICAL ARBITRARY numbers.
6859	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Based solely on vote buying, not reality.
6860	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Our &quot;poor&quot; have homes, cars, multiple TV's, cell phones, designer clothes, overnourished bodies, and a free education AVAILABLE.
6861	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	While 80% of our &quot;rich,&quot; make under $500,000.00 and are the primary source of small business job creation.You want to give more to those who already have more than they have earned by taking away from those who make it possible for the &quot;poor&quot; to have more than they have earned.
6862	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Hard work and personal responsibility are not &quot;platitudes.&quot; They are essentials to a free democratic republic functioning or not.&quot;COLLECTIVE&quot; is a favorite Communist word.
6863	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	There is no collective responsibility.

6865	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	It takes brains, and determination, and ambition.
6866	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	And an idea and a goal.
6867	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	The poor have little of any of that AND for the most part, DO NOT work hard.
6868	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	When starting out in business, I worked harder, longer, and hopefully smarter than any employee I had.
6869	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	And less money, and sometimes NO money, went in my pocket, while the employees did get paid.
6870	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	All the while not KNOWING, but taking the chance, that what I was doing WOULD be successful.
6871	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Now retired, over the course of my working life I've provided jobs, GOOD jobs, for over 1000 people.But never for a minute did I hesitate to fire anyone trying to 'coast' through the job.This country became successful because we each have had an EQUAL OPPORTUNITY to try to become successful.
6872	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1838	Nothing in our history, until liberalism, ever said everyone has an equal RIGHT to share in others success.

6874	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	Why is it suddenly wrong to provide the same health and safety in medicine, like every other developed nation does.
6875	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	People are dying and forcing their family into bankruptcy over medical bills and you're complaining about taxes?

6877	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	No one should be allowed to profit off of denying people health and safety.
6878	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	That's as simple as it gets.
6879	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	Food companies don't get away with it.

6881	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1841	And insurance companies shouldn't get away with it either.Maybe you should care less about the profits of insurance companies and more about the health and well being of your fellow Americans.
6882	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	Your arguments stand on the philosophy of Bleeding Heart Liberalism, NOTHING ELSE.You firmly believe in the liberal philosophy, Good fer you.However, as I've said many times before, your belief, your opinion, your philosophy.
6883	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A FACT.There are other philosophies, other beliefs, and other opinions.
6884	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	Just as righteous, just as provable, as yours.You &quot;CLAIM&quot; anarchy and chaos without your liberalism.
6885	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	That is plain and simple bullsh!t and that is a fact, not an opinion..
6886	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	As I stated, CHARITY could solve EVERY problem liberalism purports to solve.
6887	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	WITHOUT enlarging the Govt to the point [LONG PAST] where we cannot afford our own State OR Federal Govts.It should be obvious to any clear thinker that Government is not an answer to anything.
6888	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	Government is a necessary drain on our lives and our economy and it must at all times be tightly controlled and minimized.
6889	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	We have NOT been doing that, Democrats or Republicans, and look at the financial horror we are in.
6890	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	How is that helping the poor?
6891	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	And it IS the Govt's fault that the poor are suffering.Liberals CLAIM to be seeking answers from the Govt, but in reality you're trying to make yourself feel good using other peoples money.
6892	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	And the present day looked at with 20/20 vision should show it does not and can not work.And has ALL that came before give me an advantage and a head start?
6893	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	Yes, ABSOLUTELY it did.
6894	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	THE EXACT SAME ADVANTAGE THAT EVERY LAZY WORTHLESS PARASITE GOT AS WELL.
6895	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	I just made the most of the same advantage instead of whining and looking for handouts.And how about an answer to the question.
6896	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	How much is ENOUGH?
6897	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	With the so called 25&#37; rich now paying 86.6% of all our income tax and your 'poor' and the remaining 47% of the public paying NOTHING.Should the rich pay 99.999%?
6898	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1842	And if you think that, I can tell you that many liberals would want much more.
6899	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I'm sorry, I thought it was obvious that we're discussing philosophy at this point.
6900	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And I **never** claimed to be righteous.
6901	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I am not, never have been, and never will be righteous.
6902	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I have no special insight, no divine inspiration, no special connection to some absolute Truth.
6903	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And I most certainly do not have all the answers.
6904	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I'm just one fallible person doing my best to figure things out and maybe contribute a little to making the community a bit better.
6905	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	If I'm wrong, then show me. Show me where I'm wrong, give me a convincing argument, or show me some evidence, and I'll change my mind if it measures up.
6906	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	But don't expect me to take you seriously if all you have is &quot;cause I say so.&quot;Chaos and anarchy are very real possibilities when the people at the top of the socio-economic ladder neglect those farther down.
6907	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	History is full of examples of revolts and revolutions when people are pushed too far.
6908	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And even more examples of great civilizations falling into darkness when their leadership neglects the big picture.
6909	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	From the First Intermediate Period of Ancient Egypt to the Russian Revolution of 1917, chaos and anarchy is a specter that our society has always lived with.
6910	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And if we let things fall apart, it *can* happen here.
6911	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	The US is subject to the same forces as every other nation in our world's history.
6912	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	If we wish to avoid the fate of so many of our predecessors, we need to learn from their examples, both what they did right and what they did wrong.

6914	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Neither can be neglected if we want this grand experiment we call the United States to succeed in the long term.Tell me, why do you think government assistance programs were instituted in the first place?
6915	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Because private charities simply weren't getting the job done.
6916	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Government is not inherently evil, any more then any other social institution.
6917	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	It is simply a tool, and whether it does good or ill depends entirely on how it's used.Do you honestly believe that poverty (as relative a term as that is) exists solely because those who aren't rich are all &quot;lazy worthless parasites&quot;?
6918	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	You see poverty as only being a personal moral failing?
6919	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Then why in the world is poverty still a social issue?
6920	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Do you think it's fun being poor?
6921	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Do you think that living on government benefits gives you a luxurious lifestyle?
6922	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Then you need a serious reality check, my friend.
6923	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	I assure you that none of that is even remotely true.
6924	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	And generally speaking, the poor most definitely do not use benefits to buy designer clothes.
6925	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	Paying the basic bills is enough of a challenge, I promise you.How much is enough?
6926	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	There is never a firm answer to that.
6927	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	It's something that we as a community must decide through the political process, through consensus and compromise, through actually listening to each other.
6928	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	What we need are practical, pragmatic people from all over the political spectrum to talk, to give us their points of view, to make suggestions, to be as forceful an advocate for their positions as possible.
6929	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	We need to take the best that each of us has to offer, even the parts that you don't agree with.
6930	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1843	But we need serious ideas, not, &quot;I don't want to pay taxes,&quot; not, &quot;But why should *I* have to so something about it?&quot; not, &quot;Hey, man, it's not my job.&quot;
6931	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	The revolts in the past have been against &quot;the power&quot; being used to stop individualism and freedom.
6932	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Pretty much what liberalism is trying to do now.
6933	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	There have been NO revolts in history against a free market.
6934	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Right now LIBERALS in Europe are revolting, striking, and looting and destroying, and even KILLING because the fiscal mess cannot be supported any longer and they are losing a tiny bit of their FREEBIES.
6935	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	And for that they are willing to kill.
6936	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	That is LIBERALS willing to kill to keep their unsustainable giveaway programs.
6937	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	You cannot SEE the danger there?????Conservatives are trying to say and have said for years, &quot;Let's NOT follow Europe, let Europe follow us.&quot; But liberals insisted that we follow Europe.
6938	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Can you not see where that ends.
6939	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Bankrupt countries, fiscally AND morally bankrupt under the guise of doing good and being 'compassionate.You ask for proof, you ask I make a good argument against liberalism, Simple, EUROPE!Europe should be the little kid tagging along behind and trying to get the big kids to play with them.
6940	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	Instead, if we do not change our ways, Europe is showing us our own bleak future.ENABLING people to BE poor is what liberalism does.
6941	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	It does nothing to ennoble people it only enables them.Liberals say that placing demands on the poor is demeaning them.
6942	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	That is the exact opposite of the truth.
6943	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	MAKE them earn everything, and they will find ambition, pride, self esteem, and drive.
6944	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	And personal responsibility.If we can afford to give to the poor, we can afford to make work for them to do instead.And your claim that charity was not doing the job is completely fallacious.
6945	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	No giveaway programs were started to make up a charitable shortfall.
6946	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	ALL giveaway programs have one purpose and one purpose only.
6947	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1844	And that is not to help the poor, it is to help the politician buy votes.And NO conservative is saying, &quot;I don't want to pay taxes.&quot; We are saying, &quot;We refuse to pay even MORE taxes until the Govt stops wasting 50 cents of every tax dollar we pay now.&quot;
6948	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Why on earth would we pay for permanent jobs for the poor?!
6949	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Assistance is only supposed to be a temporary thing.
6950	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Providing jobs just for the sake of providing jobs has the potential to be a lifelong commitment!
6951	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	It would cost more money for about the same amount of benefit!
6952	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	The only jobs government should be creating for the sake of improving the economy is temporary jobs.
6953	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	And they should only be creating those in times of economic slowdown.
6954	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	We don't want to set ourselves up for a bunch of life long commitments unless it's going to seriously improve our economy.
6955	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Temporary assistance is all most poor people need.
6956	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Most people on welfare get off it within a few years because they are able to find a job and support their family.
6957	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1845	Welfare helps the poor get back to work.
6958	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1846	&quot;WELFARE HELPS THE POOR GET BACK TO WORK!&quot;HOW???There is NOTHING temporary about the giveaway programs we have for the poor.
6959	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1846	The only changes to the giveaway programs is they get increased.
6960	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	It's a fact that the average welfare family only stays on welfare for a few years that the most.
6961	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	The welfare life is not a life of luxury.
6962	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	People want to get off it as soon as possible.And welfare does help people get back to work in that it keeps demand up in recessions which causes businesses to hire again sooner.
6963	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	In the end welfare saves us more money than it costs because welfare is a recession buster.Want to end a recession quickly and effectively?
6964	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1847	Increase foodstamps and extend welfare benefits.
6965	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	And pass the costs on to INFINITY?Only 2 things wrong with your &quot;plan.&quot;1.It doesn't work2.
6966	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	We cannot afford it.A Govt is no different than you and I. If we keep running out of money before the end of the year, we KNOW we have to CHANGE what we've been doing.
6967	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	And since, like the Govt, we can only marginally increase our revenue, we must stop our outflow.
6968	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	That is not painless or welcome to an individual or a Govt.
6969	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	Things that cannot be avoided and MUST be done are seldom relished.
6970	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	But still must be done.
6971	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1848	There is NO alternative choice except for things to get worse and worse until collapse!
6972	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Welfare has already been proven to work.
6973	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Hence why it's been around for 80 years.
6974	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Hence why every economic school teaches that an extension of welfare benefits is an economic stimulus.
6975	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Back before republicans went crazy stupid they knew this fact as well.
6976	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Extention of welfare in bad times used to be a bipartisan thing because everyone who knew anything about economics knows welfare benefits the economy like every school child knows the earth rotates around the sun.
6977	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Just because you don't understand how it works doesn't mean it doesn't work.We aren't running out of money because welfare costs too much.
6978	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	We're running out of money because our taxes have been way too low for about 30 years now.
6979	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Since Reagan cut them.
6980	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	Conservatives would rather see more in their paycheck then see a country where people do not starve to death or die of a curable disease simply because they couldn't afford food and medicine.
6981	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	And they think they are following Jesus in doing so.
6982	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1849	What a joke.
6983	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1850	Welfare did start under a liberal president in the 1930's.
6984	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1850	It worked so well that the Great Depression ended shortly after the end of WWII in the later 1940's.
6985	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1850	Way to go!Tax, Spend, Tax, Spend,Hup, Hoop, hreep, harr,Tax, Spend, Tax, Spend,Hup, Hoop, hreep, harr,Tax, Spend, Tax, Spend,Hup, Hoop, hreep, harr,

6987	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1851	I want my lawn cared for.
6988	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1851	Are you going to help pay for it?
6989	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1851	You know, since you are such a &quot;patriot.&quot;
6990	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1853	What does lawn care have to do with health and safety?
6991	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1853	We're talking about people dieing of curable disease.
6992	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1853	That's not at all comparable.
6993	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1854	Because I'm going to get depressed if my lawn doesn't look good.
6994	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1854	Nobody dies from preventable disease in America, nobody is denied healthcare already.
6995	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1855	Here's a fact or 2.You are a liberal.
6996	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1855	Sadly, around 20% of Americans still are liberals.And you just played the race card against an opponent.
6997	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1855	Not because your opponent is racist, but because its the only thing your Kool-Aid purveyors have taught you to do.
6998	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1856	Your last 2 paras are liberal dreaming of a perfect world that WILL NOT happen.
6999	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1856	Its had 50 years to happen in Medicare so far and it has not happened ever.
7000	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1856	Politicians from both parties claiming THEY will stop Medicare,[insurance] and Medicaid [welfare] fraud are old, old news.
7001	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1856	NONE has any real money to show for their promises.
7002	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1856	And $500 BILLION is the silliest claim EVER made.
7003	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1856	And it won't happen

7005	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1857	It's a hard choice to put your family through tens of thousands in debt or just die a quiet death and leave your family debt free.
7006	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1857	A lot of Americans choose the latter.

7009	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1857	It's paying for it afterwards that's the problem.
7010	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1857	And no body should be forced to put their family into debt to survive.

7018	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1858	It's a lot more money, through taxes and insurance.
7019	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1858	It's worse healthcare for the people paying for the healthcare.
7020	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1858	It's free healthcare for people who contribute nothing.

7028	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1858	That's the whole point of insurance, you know to insure yourself from being in the position to choose between outrageous prices and not getting the healthcare.

7031	SFJEFF	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1859	Absolutely wrong.If your health insurance won't cover it, and you don't have the money, many, many diseases will not get treated, and you get to die.
7032	SFJEFF	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1859	While it is true that if you are without insurance you can go to an emergency room for treatment, that doesn't mean you can automatically get whatever treatment is necessary.

7045	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1864	However, you seem to have the need to be so one sided on the issue.

7048	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1864	Then would you not agree that it was a good thing our brave soldiers ended up getting rid of him and at least hundreds of his secret death squad police?

7050	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1864	For example, is your country free of killing innocents?
7051	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1864	What about the treatment of the Aboriginals?

7056	CommonDenominator	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1866	Your poll is missing &quot;depends&quot;as in, my vote will depend upon the candidates....I am not particularly happy with Obama, but the GOP will have to put up an &quot;electable&quot; candidate to get my vote.I would vote for Obama over Sarah Palin, but Mitt Romney I would consider.Anyone that would vote for the GOP or any political party without considering the candidates that are running is letting others make up their mind.I would love to see someone like Ron Paul to get a real chance.I admit he is a little rigid in his beliefs, and they are not necessarily popular with a lot of people.
7057	CommonDenominator	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1866	But if you listen to him, his logic is sound.
7058	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	LOL you claim I don't provide sources then you make this rediculious claim that the entire reason healthcare costs are high is because of legal costs.
7059	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	That's absolutely ridiculous.
7060	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	And I will cite this one:http://washingtonindependent.com/634...pending-by-0-2The cbo estimated that only .5&#37; savings would come out of tort reform.
7061	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	And .2 of that .5% would come from people being less likely to use medical services.
7062	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	In other words because of the fact that Tort reform has already passed in most states, a nationwide tort reform would do next to nothing in terms of healthcare savings.
7063	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	Are you really this daft?
7064	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	People die from treatable cancers all the time because they don't have the insurance to cover regular checkups.
7065	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	Sure you can go to the emergency room after you're pissing blood.
7066	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	But by then you're already dead.
7067	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	Yeah.
7068	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	And if your job lets you go because you have cancer and can't work anymore and you lose your employers healthcare good luck getting a new insurance plan.
7069	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	Basic healthcare is the ability to get regular checkups.
7070	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	And no we don't have that for all Americans.
7071	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	Only those who can afford it.
7072	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	And regular checkups save lives.
7073	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	You cannot simply go to the emergency room and expect to survive.
7074	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	And if you do you have just put your family into tens of thousands of debt.
7075	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	If we had universal healthcare that wouldn't happen.
7076	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	Why do you think people in countries with universal healthcare live longer than us and have better birth rates than us?
7077	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	You don't think it's sad that the richest country on earth has the worst healthcare of any developed nation?
7078	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1868	Or are you one of those idiots that just closes their eyes and pretends because we are America that means we are number 1.
7079	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1869	Seriously why should my money go to protecting people who won't even pay a few extra dollars to see everyone have free on delivery healthcare without insurance bull(*)(*)(*)(*).Sad when people defend the profits of corporations over the basic health and safety of Americans.
7080	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1869	I don't even understand the mindset.
7081	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1869	Especially when in the end it's a cheaper system for America.
7082	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1869	They'd rather have more money in their pockets than a more healthy country.
7083	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1869	And these are the so called patriots.
7084	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	You cite liberal biased sources, that reinforce the liberal policy.Cite a source like the AMA.
7085	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	They say things like between 2000 and 2006 17,700 uninsured people died with preventable diseases.
7086	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	Did they die because they had no insurance?
7087	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	NO, they died because they did not do check ups, did not take care of themselves.
7088	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	You and the liberal idiots will say that's because they had no insurance, that's why they did not get check up's.Here is a simple fact, not an opinion, that even liberals should be capable of understanding.
7089	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	It costs MORE to have insurance to pay for check ups than it would to pay for check ups on our own.Insurance IS a for profit business.
7090	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	IF they did not charge more in premiums than they pay out, they would not be able to pay for anyone's care for anything.
7091	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	And the insurance companies profits are regulated by politicians.So obamacare changes nothing there except trade state politicians for federal politicians.
7092	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	And you wanna bet the state politicians keep their expensive jobs while a whole new set of federal politicians and bureaucrats come on the scene and PAYROLL.And the people that died for the own lack of caring for themselves, COULD have gone to their COUNTY HEALTH SERVICE [an already in place Govt health care plan] for regular medical care.
7093	Dan40	SFJEFF	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1871	They would have paid for routine care according to their individual ability to pay Again obamacare does no change here just adds a layer of costs to already existing programs long in place.
7094	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1872	You don't pay tax money.

7096	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1872	I don't want to hear you talk about tax money.
7097	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1872	If you are on government assistance you don't have a right to (*)(*)(*)(*)(*) about where tax money is going.
7098	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	you Think the cbo is a liberal biased source.
7099	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	Which demonstates your inability to determine what is and is not liberally biased.
7100	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	To you anything that disagrees with the republican world view is a liberal source.
7101	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	Link please.
7102	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	And it can continue to be even after universal healthcare.
7103	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	There are profitable insurance companies in Europe and Canada.
7104	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	Then that's just prove that the for profit healthcare system is broken.
7105	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	Which is why universal healthcare would be better.
7106	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	Those services are far too few and far too spread apart to make a real dent in healthcare costs.
7107	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	It forces insurance companies to take in preexisting conditions.
7108	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	That's a good thing.
7109	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	And if it puts insurance companies out of business then so be it.
7110	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1873	Government could be doing their job better anyway like it does in every other developed country.

7141	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1881	That's just swell, until the person loses their job and then with health care coverage with it and can't find new employment with health coverage until the pre-existing limitations period expires.
7142	JLB	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1882	You do know that health insurance can be purchased independently from your employer, right?
7143	Iriemon	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1883	They now have rights to continue coverage under Cobra.
7144	Iriemon	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1883	But someone who just lost their job can't often afford the Cobra insurance rates, which are usually mulitples higher than what they paid when employer because the employer often pays for some or all of it.So they lose their insurance, and if they don't get replacement insurance within a short period of time they can get screwed by the pre-existing.
7145	JLB	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1884	No, you buy your own insurance and opt out of your employer's plan.
7146	JLB	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1884	That way you keep your insurance before, during, and after your employment.Once the Republicans dismantle Obamacare and allow insurance policies to be marketed across state lines, bringing in competition to the mix, then rates will fall.Be patient...
7147	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1886	Actually, allowing insurance companies to sell across state lines would have the opposite effect.
7148	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1886	Because the health insurance companies will all do the exact same thing the credit card companies have done - move to the state with the least regulations and fewest consumer protections.
7149	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1886	Considering that some states place *no* restrictions at all on policy premiums or rate increases, somehow I doubt they're going to reduce their rates out of the goodness of their hearts.
7150	Iriemon	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1887	Wonderful idea.For that small percentage who lose their job and still can afford to pay for insurance on their own.

7165	jthorp24	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1889	That is common sense.

7167	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1891	But if the overall cost goes up marginally less the per capita costs decrease.
7168	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1891	Plus you don't have the cost of relying on emergency rooms for primary care.

7178	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	And it'll make everyone not notice that you provided no evidence or references, did not actually address anything I said, and what you did say is incoherent, and doesn't actually work out to be a criticism of the health care law at all.Of course the total amount spent on health care hasn't gone down.
7179	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	No one ever said it would.

7181	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	As I said, the health care law was aimed primarily at expanding coverage and reforming insurance regulation.
7182	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	It has several measures aimed at improving efficiency in the health care system and works to shift the focus of treatment away from expensive specialists and toward preventive care and general practitioners, all of which should help contain costs in the long run.
7183	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	But cost containment is not and was never said to be the main intent.
7184	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	There are also several pilot programs in the law to explore ways to contain costs, but there are no easy answers.
7185	Kessy_Athena	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1895	Besides, with a growing population, and rising costs far in excess of inflation, it would be virtually impossible to actually reduce the total costs.

7192	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	An opinion strongly supported by evidence and shared by most economists.
7193	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	And your opinion that it hasn't helped still has absolutely no support of any kind whatsoever.Bush took us from a surplus to a recurring, structural deficit during a time of prosperity mainly for the sake of giving the wealthiest Americans large tax breaks.
7194	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	Obama came into office in the middle of the worst recession since the Great Depression, and ran up a deficit with one time stimulus measures to prevent the economy from collapsing completely.
7195	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	Plus, a large portion of the current deficit is simply due to lower tax revenues because of the bad economy.
7196	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1896	Once the economy recovers and the stimulus money is spent, Obama's contribution to the deficit will almost completely disappear.Deficit spending during a national emergency (such as a severe recession) is a good thing, a necessary thing.

7223	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	&quot;But the losses to the economy following the failure of Lehman have been on the order of hundreds of billions, maybe trillions.
7224	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Certainly the rescue and stimulus packages needed in the wake of the Lehman failure have amounted to the trillions.&quot; While I certainly can't speak for Mr Stein, I would imagine he would argue that the stimulus money could have been better spent to much more effect, but that's not the same as saying that the stimulus has had no effect at all or even made things worse.http://spectator.org/archives/2010/0...-of-depressionIn any case, $288 billion of the stimulus, 37% of the total, went to tax breaks of various kinds.
7225	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Are you going to argue that tax cuts don't stimulate the economy, onalandline?Basically, it comes down to this.
7226	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Are you going to deny that we were on the brink of another great depression?
7227	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Are you going to deny that we've moved back from the brink since then?
7228	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	You can argue exactly how much the stimulus helped the economy, and you can certainly make the case that the money could have been spent more effectively.
7229	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	But if you want to say that the stimulus had no effect at all, I'm afraid you're going to have to back that up with something fairly substantial.
7230	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Maybe the economy would have stopped short of the brink on its own, and maybe it wouldn't have.

7232	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	and once again we come back to the simple question, which is preferable, 10% unemployment, or 25%?Yes, the current deficits are history-making and record-breaking.
7233	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Because the recession is history-making and record-breaking.

7245	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	As I just said in another thread:That is a sufficiently misleading statement as to qualify as a lie in my book.
7246	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Unless there's a recession, tax revenues pretty much always go up, regardless.
7247	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	But so do expenditures.If you set the tax rate to zero, you obviously get zero revenues.
7248	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	So the blanket statement that lowering taxes always increases revenues is patently false.
7249	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Lowering taxes has two effects.
7250	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	It decreases the rate of taxes paid, which tends to decrease revenues.
7251	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	And it stimulates the economy, which enlarges the tax base, which tends to increase revenues.
7252	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	When tax rates are very high, the economic stimulus effect predominates.
7253	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	When taxes are very low, the decreased rates predominate.
7254	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	There's a curve, with peak revenues somewhere in the middle.
7255	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	The question is which side of the curve we're on right now?
7256	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Considering that current US tax rates are really very low, both by historical US standards and compared to other industrialized countries, and considering that Bush's tax cuts clearly created a large deficit, I think the answer is fairly obvious.
7257	Kessy_Athena	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1902	Then why has it been used by Presidents of both parties and all philosophies in every economic downtown since the Great Depression?

7499	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1952	How do you define &quot;recession&quot;?
7500	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1953	It is over a year after the fact.
7501	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1953	The recession ended June 2009.
7502	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1953	We know for a fact the recession ended then.If the economy starts to shrink again then that would be another recession entirely.
7503	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1953	Though I don't know where you get that things are getting worse... the economy is continuing to grow, though not as fast as people would like.
7504	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1953	However it's only a matter of time till jobs start coming back.
7505	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1953	Companies are reporting record numbers of cash on hand.
7506	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1953	They just need more assurance that this is a stable economy that isn't going to crash again.
7507	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1953	And more and more we are seeing that slowly but surely the economy is stabilizing itself.
7508	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1953	It's only a matter of time now.
7509	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1954	In whatever way makes Obama look bad.If by 2014 Obama is still president and we have 4.5&#37; unemployment he'll be saying we're in a recession because there are still people who are unemployed.
7510	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1954	Or we're about to enter a recession.
7511	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1954	One of those.Republicans we're saying we are about to enter a recession all throughout the 90s.
7512	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1954	The recession never did happen all the way up until 2007.
7513	TheTaoOfBill	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1954	Turns out Clinton's policies kept us recession free for 15 years.
7514	Iriemon	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1955	I'm just curious if he asserts we are still in a recession, what definition he is using and the source for his definition.
7515	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1956	Actually, that's not true, Bill.
7516	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1956	The US had a recession in 2000 - 2001, caused largely by the tech bubble bursting.Let's be honest here, folks, the economy is an enormous beast with a tremendous amount of inertia that tends to do as it pleases.
7517	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1956	The government has only a limited ability to influence what it does, and within the government the Federal Reserve has much more ability to effect the economy then the President and the Congress.
7518	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1956	There's only so much *any* President can do, positive or negative.And for the umpteenth time, the economy right now is stagnant, not in recession.
7519	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1957	You've probably noticed, in real life, that &quot;stagnant&quot; has a certain unpleasant odor about it.Do you know the difference between humor and odor?Humor is a shift of wit!Just tryin' to lighten up.
7520	Iriemon	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1958	Good post, but there are recessions and then there are recessions.The 2001 &quot;Clinton recession&quot; as conservatives often call it was more like a slowdown.
7521	Iriemon	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1958	As GDP figures were ultimately calculated, GDP never went down in two consecutive quarters, which is the classic test of a recession, and in the worst year, FY2001, real GDP increased 1.1%, and actual GDP increased over 3%.I know you didn't compare them, but the 2001 &quot;recession,&quot; if it is even fair to call it a recession (I know the NBER classified it as such) was a much different beast that the recession Obama inherited.
7522	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1959	[giggles] Yes, you're absolutely right, Dan.
7523	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1959	Stagnation sucks, big time.
7524	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1959	But recession sucks more.
7525	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1959	It's like the difference between a wildfire that's raging out of control and one that's been contained but not put out.
7526	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1960	That's cute.Though I am curious as to your response to my question:How do you define &quot;recession&quot;?When you accuse others of &quot;drinking koolaid&quot; I'd expect you could at least defend your position as to the basis for that assertion.
7527	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1961	But it 'hain't' no way to get re-elected!Do you know the difference between an epileptic oyster shucker and a prostitute with diarrhea?The epileptic oyster shucker shucks between fits!

7531	shaker154	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1962	Government bond anyone?We need recovery, Just like BO needs vacations to recover
7532	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1964	Actually no there was no recession in 2000-2001.
7533	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1964	A recession is 2 sequential quarters of economic shrinkage.
7534	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1964	There was never 2 quarters of shrinkage between 2000 and 2001.
7535	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1964	So there was never a recession.
7536	TheTaoOfBill	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1964	Just a slowdown.
7537	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1965	Tsk, tsk, Bill.
7538	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1965	If you're going to reproach others for presenting facts in a deceptive way, you really shouldn't do it yourself.
7539	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1965	US GDP fell in the first and third quarters of 2001.
7540	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1965	Technically not a recession, but for all practical purposes it was.
7541	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1965	It was also a worldwide slowdown, and many other countries *did* meet their technical definitions of recession.
7542	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1965	Yes, it was a very mild recession, but don't try to explain it away.
7543	Kessy_Athena	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1965	It's really not a good idea to hide behind technicalities.
7544	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	I stand by my claims.
7545	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	I asked you to provide quotes to back up your claims however they are non existent.

7548	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	Now you ask what has the United States done so well?
7549	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	She is a super power and the world leader like it or not.
7550	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	That is not a arrogant statement, it is a statement of fact.

7555	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	You say these things, and just in your gun control argument you cling to studies funded to say what you want to hear.
7556	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	Sorry that fails in debate.
7557	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	Your first and second sentence why your entire idea about the USA is incorrect.
7558	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	If we hadn't been all that I highly doubt your countries would exist.
7559	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	In WW2 if the USA had not of assisted your country it would of been overrun for example.
7560	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	And FWI, your statement about the USA's 'rather immoral' behavior is another example another hypocritical statement, because other countries immoral behavior are often exceedingly worse than the USA's.
7561	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	All countries sometimes act in 'rather immoral' ways because that is what must governments do to ensure the continued existence of their host countries at times.
7562	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	However compared to other countries I would rather be an POW etc in the USA compared to almost any other country.
7563	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	If the USA was truly immoral I wouldn't say that.
7564	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	You have insinuated as much, which is worse because you can not man up enough to put what you mean in plain words.
7565	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1967	Ok, to the rest of the forum I apologize for zinging this far off topic, I will not comment on this with MD again unless we start a new thread.ra
7566	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1968	I can tell you Obama seems to be swilling Jim Jones koolaid like his name is Otis Campbell drinking Mayberrys finest hooch if he thinks he is going to be reelected.
7567	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1968	We have a terrible job market and I can tell Obama that spending trillions here and trillions there has failed.
7568	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1968	The smoke and mirrors of the white house imaginary jobs is a pathetic attempt to save Obamas butt.
7569	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1968	However read my lips, Obama is gone in 2013.
7570	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1968	And, that's all I have to say about that, except that I am exceedingly happy the majority of Americans even a goodly number of the original jaded Obama lovers have seen the golden boys color fade from gold to his true color; pewter gray.
7571	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1968	For a time I thought my fellow Americans had lost leave of their senses nearly worshiping the Harvard 'professor' (a misnomer really).

7599	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1978	The hallmark of this liberal administration and the Kool-Ade drinking liberal groupies, EXCUSES.
7600	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1978	Never before in human history have so many excuses, been made so often, by by so few.
7601	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1978	That has a familiar sound!!!
7602	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1979	But I thought government can't create jobs.
7603	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1979	So what do you want Obama to do exactly?
7604	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1979	Oh wait.
7605	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1979	You're one of those people who said we should have done absolutely nothing at all.
7606	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1979	I wonder what sort of excuses you would have given by now.
7607	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1980	There IS no PROOF that doing nothing would have made anything worse, just as there is no PROOF that the massive never ending flow of various Stimulus plans have accomplished anything but more debt.
7608	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1980	Of that and that alone, THERE IS PROOF!And the Govt can create jobs.
7609	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1980	But they are only Govt jobs and thus are a burden on a vibrant economy rather than an impetus to the economy.
7610	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1981	You can't mathematically prove anything in economics.But there is lots of evidence that the Stimulus has had a significant impact, as logic would tell you it would.
7611	jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	Really?
7612	jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	Logic would tell us that?
7613	jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	Unemployment is still close to it's peak.
7614	jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	We spent $860 billion.
7615	jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	Next to nothing has been done.
7616	jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1982	Just wait until the effects of the wasted money.
7617	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1983	Logic would tell us if the Govt hadn't pumped a few hundred billion in spending into the economy creating demand for jobs and paying for jobs for folks who would otherwise have been fired, unemployment would have gotten much higher and the recession would be worse.Conservatives tell us all the time that tax cuts spur economic growth, so if you believe that, logic would tell you that the hundreds of billions in tax cuts had an efffect as well and that the economy would have been worse and unemployment higher without it.Finally, logic tells us from empirical data, including FDR's new deal and WWII, that Govt spending stimulates the economy, and finally the fact that in this period the fact the economy went from tanking -7&#37; real and losing 700,000 jobs a month to growing and the private sector adding jobs suggests the stimulus had a positive effect, as the bi-partisan and most economists agree.While $860 billion is a lot, I agree, and it is almost as much money wasted in the mistaken war in Iraq, comparatively it represents just over 5% of the economy.
7618	Iriemon	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1983	Given that both Govt spending and the deficit were cut in FY2010, we shouldn't be surprised that this modest amount of stimulus, while logic and evidence suggest it helped turn the economy around and stop getting worse, wasn't sufficiently large to really set it on fire.Unfortunately, fiscal mismanagement by the prior three Republican administrations left the nation in such a precarious state of debt that only a limited amount of stimulus was prudent.
7619	Hijothis	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1984	Oh things have been done alright.

7622	jthorp24	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1985	Need I say more?
7623	frodly	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1986	Well, since you didn't actually say anything, my first instinct would be that in fact yes, yes you do.
7624	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1987	I agree 100&#37;.

7630	TheTaoOfBill	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1988	Which is why it confuses the hell out of me when conservatives say they want more common sense in government.
7631	TheTaoOfBill	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1988	Sorry but government policy is complicated.

7634	TheTaoOfBill	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1988	I want people with uncommon sense in government.
7635	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1989	Right now we have people in power with:No common sense,No uncommon sense,No practical sense,Just nonsense.They have consistently repeated that if enough money is spent and we wait long enough, their unproven theorems, will eventually work.If the Government HAD $4 or $5 trillion extra dollars laying around doing nothing, perhaps, and only perhaps, a case could be made for their theorems.However when every cent the people in power are spending on Stimulus is BORROWED money with no end in sight or any method to pay it back, the theorems go out the window.The rescinding of the Bush tax cuts are not even an issue.
7636	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1989	They WILL hurt the economy and they WON&quot;T lower the debt a single penny.It is all liberal window dressing and sleight of hand.
7637	jthorp24	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1990	$860 billion is now considered &quot;a few billion,&quot; to liberals now?
7638	jthorp24	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1990	It's really getting sad.
7639	jthorp24	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1990	People just don't realize how much money that is.
7640	TheTaoOfBill	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1991	Not that much at all compared to the losses we would have endured.
7641	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1992	Oh please.
7642	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1992	Paying billions of dollars to save a few jobs.
7643	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1992	It's getting quite comical.

7646	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1992	That's 2 million per job.
7647	jthorp24	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1992	2 million!
7648	Dan40	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1993	The obamalama claimed that the stimulus &quot;CREATED&quot; 50,000 NEW 'WINDFARM' JOBS.
7649	Dan40	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1993	The only problem is those generators were up and running BEFORE the obamalama became president.
7650	Dan40	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1993	Another 50,000 jobs 'created' in his own mind.Even if the stimulus did create the 3.5 million jobs claimed, which nobody believes, including the liberal media.
7651	Dan40	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1993	It still comes to $232,571.43, cost per job created.So with 14.8 million unemployed, we only need $3,442,057,164,000.00 more stimulus to achieve full employment.And our great, great, great, great, great, great, grand kids can worry about the debt.
7652	Dan40	TheTaoOfBill	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1995	The $232,000.00 is the cost of a Govt created job, not the salary.The private sector cost of creating a job is $31,000.00, not the salary.
7653	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1996	lol wut?
7654	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1996	Do you just pull these numbers out of your ass or something.
7655	TheTaoOfBill	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1996	Where the hell does 31,000 dollars per job in the private sector come from?

7658	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	The recession is/was wholly caused by the Govt meddling in the free market.
7659	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Then the politicians BLAME the free market for all the problems the Govt caused.You liberals scream about deregulation of the free market and clamor for more regulation.
7660	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Well we had regulation, the Govt repealed many, very good, very effective regulations, in order to further THEMSELVES politically.
7661	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Now a new financial regulation bill has been passed in great haste and in a completely partisan manner.
7662	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	ALREADY it is seen as ridiculous.
7663	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	The SEC was exempted from new regs.
7664	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	You want Wall Street to toe the line and you [liberals] exempt the SEC?
7665	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Even Barney Frank blanched at that.
7666	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	He said that the bill was passed so quickly he didn't have a copy to read.
7667	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	That is an absolute intentional LIE.
7668	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	And indicative of the problem of the Govt meddling where they are sadly incompetent, the free market.You personally and liberals in general keep repeating that if the Govt had not WASTED well over a TRILLION dollars we'd be in such bad shape.
7669	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	This is OPINION, NOT FACT.
7670	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	A fact is that many recession in the past have corrected themselves without any Govt intervention.
7671	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	would this have been another one to correct itself?
7672	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	We will never know that because we HAVE HAD massive intervention by the very same people that caused the recession.
7673	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	And the SEEDS of this recession were NOT planted by Bush or Republicans.
7674	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	The clock was running long before Bush, and both parties are equally to blame.The Stimulus did not and HAS not worked.

7676	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	And in addition to the failure, we now have more debt accumulating than any other president in history.Bush increased the debt by an average of $625 billion per year.
7677	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	obama IS increasing the debt by $1.5 TRILLION per year.
7678	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	And you liberals claim Bush was terrible.
7679	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	You ARE right, Bush was terrible [and he was &quot;the Govt.&quot;] and now obama is the Govt and he is 2.4 times WORSE than Bush.Why does Freddie and Fannie now need ANOTHER $300+ BILLION to further bail them out?
7680	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Because F&amp;F invented, bought, and guaranteed the fictitious &quot;sub-prime&quot; loans.The free market did not invent those worthless loans, calling them what they are, F&amp;F &amp; &quot;THE GOVT did that for the good of all of us.
7681	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Liberals scream about the ruthless crooks on Wall Street.

7683	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	YES.

7685	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	Are they running for re-election on the merits of obamacare?
7686	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	NO!Are they running on the great jobs reports?

7690	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1998	They're saying, the pooch is screwed, and you can't hear them because your ears are full of the Kool-Ade.

7695	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	The reality is, government did play a role in the current economic crisis, but the reality is also that the market did as well.
7696	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Government did keep interest rates too low, but they also deregulated the whole industry(that means less government, not more), and the market failed.
7697	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Banks did act incompetently.
7698	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	They did, when given more freedom, cause a massive problem.
7699	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	The same is true of consumers of housing.
7700	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	People bought houses they couldn't afford, not because government made them, but because they made irrational decisions.
7701	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Irrational decisions are not taken into account in the laissez faire fairy tale story.
7702	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Nor are market failures, externalities, etc.But that is the problem some of us are able to see the problems government solves and the problems it creates.
7703	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	We don't need a black and white world where X is the problem and Y is the solution.
7704	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Not when the reality is that sometimes X IS a problem, but it is also sometimes a solution.
7705	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Just like Y is sometimes a solution, but it can also be a problem as well.
7706	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	That is the reality of the market(I don't call it the free market, as that is a mythical concept made up in the laissez faire fairy tales.
7707	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	It is sort of like a unicorn), it can do some things extraordinarily well, but cannot do others things as well.
7708	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	Government is the same.
7709	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	But that takes a level of nuance and recognition of complexity that too many are incapable of recognizing.
7710	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	I really do tire of the simplistic arguments where either government is the source of all problems, or greedy corporations are the source of all problems.
7711	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	1999	The reality is they are both capable of doing good things as well as bad.
7712	Jollee	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2000	No, just like I dont let my dog soil my carpet.....
7713	frodly	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2001	Is this meant to be a folksy home truth that offers some simple insight into the issue at hand?
7714	frodly	Jollee	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2001	If it is, please explain what in the world you are talking about, because at the moment it makes no sense to me, and just seems like nonsensical gibberish.
7715	Jollee	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2002	In other words, no I am not voting for him!Jollee
7716	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	[giggles] My ears are full of Kool-Ade?
7717	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Dan, I think your metaphor has kinda derailed here.
7718	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Look, like I've said before, I'm a pragmatist - I go with what works, and I go where the evidence leads me. If you want to convince me of your position, then show me evidence.
7719	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Or a thorough argument.
7720	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Or *something* that's a reason to think that.
7721	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Just saying that government is evil and always the problem over and over isn't going to cut it, you need to show how and why government is the problem.No one is saying that the market is evil or needs to be done away with or the source of nothing but problems.
7722	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Well, at least not anyone with an ounce of sense.
7723	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	The free market is an extraordinarily powerful engine for creating material wealth.
7724	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	But that's really all it does.
7725	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	As I've previously pointed out, the market left to its own devices can create some pretty bad situations.
7726	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	It needs to be balanced with other institutions.
7727	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	That doesn't necessarily need to be government, but at least so far, government has been the most effective (if very imperfect) tool for doing that.
7728	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	If you have a better suggestion, please share it.I am not especially interested in laying blame for this recession.
7729	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	I'm much more interested in figuring out what to do *now.* I agree completely that the seeds of this recession go way back, and many hands helped plant them.
7730	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	But that doesn't help us find a way out of it now.
7731	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	As I said before, fiscal stimulus is about the only tool available to the President and Congress to fight a recession.
7732	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	If you have a suggestion for something else to try, please share that too.In general, I believe in balanced budgets, and don't like deficit spending.
7733	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	But there are times when deficits are both appropriate and necessary.
7734	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Just like you should generally keep your family budget balanced, but sometimes you need to borrow because of unusual circumstances.
7735	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	A family emergency, an accident or other unforeseen expense not covered by insurance, etc. The comparison between Presidents Bush and Obama is not about how big their deficits are, but what they're being run up for.
7736	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	President Bush ran up a recurring structural deficit during a time of prosperity primarily to fund tax cuts for the top earners.
7737	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	This would be sort of like quitting your well paying full time career and instead taking a part time job, without changing your spending.
7738	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	President Obama, on the other hand, has run up a deficit with emergency, limited spending to deal with the current crisis.
7739	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	This is more analogous to if you had a fire in your house, and your insurance didn't give you enough coverage to fix everything, so you take out a loan to get things back to how they should be.I don't like bailouts any more then you do, but they are necessary.
7740	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Just look at the damage letting Lehman Brothers fail caused.
7741	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	What would have happened if we'd allowed, what was it?
7742	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Something like a dozen major companies?
7743	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	What if we'd let all of them fail at the same time?
7744	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Sometimes life doesn't give you any good options, and you have to choose the least bad one.
7745	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Surely you ran into situations like that running your business, when you had to make a hard choice between the lesser of two evils?Yes, the stimulus *has* worked, just not enough.
7746	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	We've been over this at length already, do I need to go over the CBO reports, unemployment and GDP figures, independent economic analyzes, surveys of economists, and all of that *again*?
7747	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	This will be, what, the fourth time now?
7748	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	Something like that.
7749	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	You had no answer to all that evidence before, do you have one now?As for the way Democrats are running their campaigns this year, I have to admit I am completely mystified.
7750	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2003	But then political campaigns are often not governed by reason and facts...
7751	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	I'm not much for laying blame either.
7752	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	But in this case, the blame is on &quot;THE GOVT,&quot; the same people you hope will fix WHAT THEY BROKE!
7753	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Not Democrats, Not Republicans, not liberals, not conservatives--------POLITICIANS of both parties caused our recession, unknowingly, and have no knowledge of how to fix it.Over and over, and over again, you post like liberal OPINIONS ARE FACTS, They are not facts same as my posting aren't facts unless I can point to a proof.You say Stimulus HAS worked, just not enough.
7754	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	That is FAILURE.
7755	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	That is the rewarding of the mediocre as liberals are wont to do.
7756	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	TRYING is just trying.
7757	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	DOING is accomplishment.What happens if this company fails or that company fails?SOMETHING ELSE TAKES THEIR PLACE.
7758	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	That is the free market.obamalama said GM must not fail, Many of your 'esteemed' economists said GM must not fail.
7759	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	GM did fail and is still an unconstitutional Government manufacturing company.
7760	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	In the process of becoming a Govt manufacturing co., &quot;THE GOVT,&quot; violated long existing bankruptcy laws as they were inconvenient to the Govt.
7761	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Bond holders got screwed, the taxpayer got screwed, and GM was GIFTED to the UAW in exchange for votes.
7762	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	And &quot;THE GOVT&quot; that you place SO much faith in, sweetened the pot for the UAW and GIFTED $60 BILLION in cash in addition to the bailout billions.
7763	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Then this same wonderful GOVT claims that GM paid back all of the bailout.
7764	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Yes they did, they paid it back with part of the $60 billion in WORTHLESS STOCK &quot;THE GOVT&quot; purchased for GM.
7765	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Stock presently worth $00.75, IF it were traded.
7766	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	AND THAT IS A FACT!!AND&quot;THE GOVT,&quot; GAVE Chrysler to FIAT.
7767	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	Someday we will learn why, other than somehow helping the UAW more.How much do you REFUSE to see?
7768	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2004	There is much, much more.
7769	Jollee	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2005	I would never buy a car that was Government owned, I wont give the reasons why....
7770	Jollee	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2005	But I think the Republic is smart enough to know.....
7771	JLB	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2006	Translation:JLB is far too smart for me. I tried tangling with him, and he handed me my ass.
7772	JLB	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2006	I intend to stay on the porch and not run with the big dogs, and I suggest you do the same.
7773	frodly	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2007	Translation:
7774	frodly	JLB	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2009	Ok. Thanks for the input.
7775	frodly	Lophophora	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2011	You would, wouldn't you?
7776	frodly	Lophophora	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2011	Or at least stop making predictions.....
7777	frodly	Lophophora	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2011	I guess some people never learn.
7778	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	Dan, breaking the economy and fixing it are two different things.
7779	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	While what was done wrong to get us here is important to learn from in making decisions in the future, giving the economy a boost now *is* something we know how to do.
7780	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	Fiscal stimulus has been being used successfully by administrations of both parties since the Great Depression.
7781	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	And as I've already shown, there is ample evidence that the stimulus *has* helped the economy.
7782	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	You insist on clinging to the sliver of uncertainty inherent in everything in life just because you don't like where the evidence leads.
7783	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	That's your privilege, of course, but you can't expect anyone else to pay attention to you if that's what you choose to do.If you hit a nail with a hammer, and the nail is only driven partway in, do you declare the hammer a failure and toss it away, or do you hit the nail again?
7784	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	If *one* company is going under, then sure, let the market do its thing, even if it's a really big one.
7785	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	But if there are a lot of large companies all going under at the same time?
7786	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	As a thought experiment, consider the extreme case - if every company in the country failed at the same time.
7787	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	It would be a total disaster, right?
7788	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	Each company that fails represents a hit to the economy.
7789	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	Individually, each failure is small enough that the economy as a whole can handle it.
7790	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	But if you get too much at one time, especially if the economy is already weak, it can cause a real problem.
7791	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2012	The economy is resilient and can take a lot of punishment, but there is a limit.
7792	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	You present the &quot;Doomsday Scenario,&quot; and of course, the result would be Doomsday, SURPRISE.
7793	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	The idea of bailing out Wall Street WAS to ease the credit crunch.
7794	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	They took the money and kept it and now report record profits, while not easing credit at all.How many would have failed?
7795	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	YOU DO NOT KNOW and I don't know and obamalama doesn't know.
7796	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2014	But it sure looks like crooked but not so smart politicians got hosed by crooked but smarter businessmen.
7797	JLB	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2015	I can see you can't stop thinking about me...
7798	JLB	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2016	Burger King is hiring.
7799	JLB	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2016	That would suit your capacity very well.Be all that you can be.
7800	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I only meant it as a thought experiment to point out that if a lot of large companies all fail at once, that would have larger implications beyond just those companies.
7801	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Obviously I'm not suggesting that there's any possibility that every company in the country could actually fail at the same time, that's a rather silly scenario if taken literally.No, nobody knows how many would have failed if the government had done nothing.
7802	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	But we do know that Lehman Brothers *did* fail, and it had major repercussions for the entire economy, and helped push us into recession.
7803	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	And we do know that quite a few large financial firms were also in trouble at the same time.
7804	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Would it really have been worth the risk to do nothing?And I'm no happier about the behavior of a lot of those firms after they got the bailout money then you are, but what can we do?
7805	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Should Congress try to pass a law to make them do the right thing?
7806	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Of course not, talk about government intruding on the market, and it probably wouldn't work anyway.
7807	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	So the choice we have is, do we hold our noses and help a bunch of undeserving schmucks solely because they've managed to worm their way into important positions, or do we let them go down and take the risk they'll take the rest of down with them?Besides, a lot of the TARP money has been paid back, and I believe the program is actually expected to turn a nice profit for the taxpayer when all is said and done.As for the stimulus...
7808	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	If each time you hit the nail it's driven in just a tiny bit, even if it's a microscopic amount, after a trillion hits you'll have moved the nail appreciably, even if it's not been driven all the way home yet.
7809	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Besides, what else are you going to do if you toss the hammer aside?
7810	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Try to drive in the nail with your mind?
7811	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	[j/k] We've gone from a major recession with a shrinking economy shedding jobs at a breathtaking rate to a stagnant economy with stable yet unacceptably high unemployment.
7812	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	That *is* progress, even if we still have a long way to go yet.
7813	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	And there is plenty of evidence, as I've shown, that the stimulus helped.When it comes to the campaign...
7814	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	[shrugs] What can I say?
7815	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Democrats are a bunch of wimps?
7816	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I really don't know what's going on with them.
7817	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I've heard some talking heads on TV speculate that the people running the campaigns think that, &quot;It may be bad, but it would have been a lot worse if we'd done nothing,&quot; is too complicated an argument to get across in a campaign.
7818	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I've no idea if they had any idea what they were talking about or not.
7819	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	It seems like the Democrats lost the spin war and just kinda gave up.
7820	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Don't ask me why.It seems to me (yes, this is purely my impression) that people are upset about the economy and scared for their future.
7821	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	Which is, of course, completely understandable and justified.
7822	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	But a lot of times people who are scared and upset react more emotionally, maybe the Dems are afraid that people are too emotional right now to listen to facts and figures?
7823	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2017	I really don't know, I'm purely speculating here.
7824	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	They have you thoroughly and completely brainwashed.
7825	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	The liberal party line, the public is confused, the public is scared, the public is emotional.
7826	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	And here you are, insulting us just like your masters do.We are not confused, we know what is going on.
7827	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	We are not afraid.
7828	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	We are a bit emotional, PISSED about being talked down to by an incompetent idiot whose strings are being pulled by Soros, pissed about being insulted, pissed about being told we don't know what we're doing, and pissed about the bastardization of the American Dream.And pissed about The Communist idea of &quot;redistribution of the wealth.&quot; And pissed about ruinous wasteful spending with NO plan to pay it back.
7829	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2018	Pissed about a long string of lies, bribes, earmarks, and technicalities used to pass a health-care INSURANCE bill that up to 70% of the nation does not want.So yes we are emotional to get this puppet clown out of power and then out of office.
7830	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	I'm sorry if what I said sounded condescending or insulting, that wasn't my intent at all.
7831	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	So please accept my apology, I retract what I said about it.However, I do question whether it's a good idea to judge what's going on in the real world based on what politicians say, especially politicians running for office.
7832	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	Wait a minute Dan, that almost sounds like you're complaining about the government *not* spending money.
7833	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	LOL Isn't it a good thing if it took less money to deal with the problem then was originally thought?
7834	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	I don't know for sure how much, if any, of the bailout money has been paid back, and I don't really want to argue about it.
7835	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	(To be honest, I just don't feel like doing the work to come up with hard numbers.)
7836	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	That's not really the point.
7837	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	TARP was designed to keep the financial system from completely collapsing, which it did.
7838	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	Do you think liberals *wanted* to bail out Wall Street?
7839	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	We had to do it because the danger of severe damage to the economy was too great.
7840	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2019	Besides, Dan, what would you be saying now about the government's incompetence if the bailouts hadn't happened, and it had dropped the floor out from under the economy?
7841	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	Once again, unrelentingly, you present opinions as facts.The floor DID drop out of the economy.
7842	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	Would it have been worse, OR NOT?
7843	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	We do not know.
7844	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	But we do know that the problems WERE caused by politicians.
7845	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	To push the politicians to the side and LET the FREE MARKET WORK, could have been the much wiser thing to do.
7846	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	But while there is no proof of that, neither is there any proof that letting the people that caused the problems continue to manipulate the free market to their own ends was wise either.WE ARE where we are now.
7847	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	And the people in power now have had and do have but one single plan.
7848	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	BORROW MORE, SPEND MORE BORROWED MONEY!Sorry that you are unable to realize that the majority of Americans do not agree with that &quot;plan.&quot;This from a liberal site:10/04/2010The federal government&#8217;s unpopular &#8211; and often vilified &#8212; $700 billion bailout program officially came to an end when the clock struck midnight early Monday morning.The Troubled Asset Relief Program&#8217;s (TARP) formal sunset date means that no new programs will be funded under the initiative and no more money will be doled out to prop up ailing banks, although existing programs &#8211; such as the government&#8217;s foreclosure prevention efforts &#8211; will continue to run their course with the money that&#8217;s already been allotted.Capitalists, tax-paying Americans, and even lawmakers who voted for the bill that made TARP possible two yearsago to the day have criticized the government&#8217;s massive intervention in the financial system.Initially, this monumental rescue effort was expected to cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars &#8211; a figure that prompted outcries and protests across the nation.
7849	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	But with banks now turning a profit and repaying their TARP dollars, and even the automakers and insurance giant AIG expected to be able to pay back at least part of their capital injections, the program&#8217;s price tag has shrunk to a fraction of that.The latest reports on the Treasury&#8217;s estimates put the total cost of TARP at less than $50 billion.
7850	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	Some officials have even gone so far as to say they expect the government&#8217;s bailout efforts to actually turn a profit for taxpayers when all is said and done.Numbers released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in August are not too far off from the Treasury&#8217;s figures.
7851	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	CBO&#8217;s assessment is that TARP will carry an expense of $66 billion.
7852	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2020	Treasury says $50 billion, CBO says $66 billion, liberal writer says, &quot;not too far off.&quot; Just $16,000,000,000.00 OFFTHEY-DON'T-KNOW- WHAT-THEY-ARE-DOING!

7858	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	You'll note the LOL on the end?
7859	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	And once again, unrelentingly, you try to avoid reality by calling it an opinion and pretending that makes it equally valid to claim that the stimulus hurt the economy.
7860	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	That makes as much sense as saying that the idea of a round Earth is an opinion (which it is) and therefore it is equally valid to say that the Earth is flat.Why are you so determined to cling to an idea that both all the evidence and your own theory says is wrong?
7861	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	37% of the stimulus was tax breaks, and I have yet to hear *anyone* claim that tax cuts don't stimulate the economy.
7862	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	I've repeatedly challenged you to come up with a single shred of evidence that says the stimulus didn't help the economy and you've repeatedly utterly and completely failed.In any case, are you seriously suggesting that if the financial sector had completely collapsed that things wouldn't have been much, much worse?
7863	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	As in Great Depression levels of worse?
7864	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Is that 100% absolutely certain?
7865	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Of course not, nothing in life is. It's not 100% absolutely certain the sun will rise in the East tomorrow morning.Yes, politicians are human and fallible, and yes they don't entirely know what they're doing.
7866	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Just like everyone else in the world.
7867	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Here's a news flash for you, Dan, the free market is made up of humans who are just as fallible and just as often don't know what they're doing.
7868	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Nobody forced the banks to make all those subprime mortgages, nobody forced the banks to encourage people to borrow more then they could afford, and no one forced them to bundle those bad debts as derivatives that have lead to so much grief.
7869	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	The politicians bear a lot of blame for getting us where we are.
7870	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	So does the market.
7871	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Your argument about &quot;Why should we trust politicians to get us out of this mess when they're the ones who got us in it,&quot; can just as easily be applied to the market.
7872	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	There is no one single villain in this story, and there's no single quick fix, either.And as for the $16,000,000,000.00, you seem to have no sense of scale when it comes to money.
7873	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	that sum can just as easily be expressed as 0.016 petadollars or as 1,600,000,000,000,000 millicents.
7874	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	So what?
7875	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Changing units and moving a decimal point to make something look bigger or smaller is a silly tactic.
7876	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	The difference between 50 and 66 is not huge, especially when you're talking about estimates of something there is a *lot* of uncertainty about.
7877	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2026	Even if it is in billions of dollars.

7887	SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2031	The fact that the statement was about as divorced from reality as it could get.

7899	frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	The reality is government certainly had a role to play in causing this crisis, but they were not the only catalyst, nor the main catalyst.
7900	frodly	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2032	There is plenty of blame to share between government, banks, and people who took out debt they couldn't possible service.

7902	SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	The government was the initial mover of sub-prime loans.
7903	SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	They were the ones that initially pushed banks into issuing loans, and, because those loans were so risky, they pushed the GSEs into bundling them to mitigate the risk.
7904	SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	No one in the private sector wanted to touch that market, originally.
7905	SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	It was the GSEs, with their wink and a nod hint that these bundles would be insured by the government against loss, that spurred the initial private investor involvement.The only truth at all to your words is that the private sector and Wall Street investors were deeply involved by the time it all crashed.
7906	SideTraKd	frodly	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2033	It had taken a life of it's own in the private markets, leaving the GSEs with less than half of all bundling.But it was government involvement in the markets that got the ball rolling, in the first place.
7907	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2035	Sometimes Dan seems to have a bit of a tendency to sound like government is always the cause of all problems, and letting the free market operate unfettered is the solution to everything.
7908	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2035	My point was simply that the mess we find ourselves in was not caused simply by Washington ordering banks and other institutions to make unwise financial decisions.
7909	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2035	Bad policy decisions in the government certainly played a role, but decisions made in the private sector were a big big factor in causing the recession.Just pointing out there's plenty of blame to go around.
7910	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2035	Like Alan Greenspan said about the behavior of mortgage lenders, “Those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholders’ equity, myself included, are in a state of shocked disbelief.”http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/24/bu...y/24panel.html

7915	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	VERY NEARLY.
7916	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Yes the private sector did jump in and take FULL advantage of the license to steal that the Govt gave them.
7917	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Should that come as a surprise?
7918	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Had the Govt NOT created the atmosphere and opportunity for near illegal business practices, the private sector would not have BEEN ABLE to take advantage of a situation that did not exist.Being the old fart that I am, I remember the days when bankers were the most cautious business people around.
7919	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	The old joke was that to get a loan, you had to prove to the banker that you absolutely did not need the money!If you did not have 20% down and excellent credit and a good and permanent job, RENT.
7920	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Because you would not get a loan.Bankers had no intention of changing their attitudes and practices, the Govt insisted that ALL had a right to own a house whether they could afford it or not.
7921	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	As totally stupid as that sounds, our elected representatives actually said such things.
7922	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	And REQUIRED that bankers act toward that end.Do you leave your car running with the doors and windows open and the keys in it , parked on a downtown street while you go shopping?
7923	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	NO, you don't.
7924	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	But that is what the Govt did with the mortgage and financial industries.
7925	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	Yes the private sector still had to be dishonest and drive away in the car, so they are not blameless.
7926	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2037	I know myself to be absolutely honest, but I've never been tempted with BILLIONS with no fear of prosecution.
7927	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	Well, that would be one of my problems with Greenspan.
7928	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	Because once the government implied that they would back those bundles against loss, even though it wasn't supposed to be true, it opened the door to full fledged involvement of the markets.
7929	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	Of course, it was reckless, but they were doing what the government wanted them to do.
7930	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	A lot of people saw the problem develop and tried to put a stop to it.
7931	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	Sad that Greenspan was astonished by it all.
7932	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	That self-interest of the lending institutions had the government interest of pushing the sub-prime loans super-imposed on top of it.What really galls me is to see Obama, of all people, wag his finger at the banks, as if he had no personal involvement in the entire mess.
7933	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	And now, we're supposed to forget what started it all, and accept Obama's tired analogy of Republicans driving the car into the ditch.
7934	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2039	It's quite ridiculous.
7935	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	Your logic is completely flawed.
7936	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	If not for government, the environment to do these sorts of things would have happened naturally.
7937	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	With no restrictions in place, they would have done the same thing.
7938	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	Without restriction, a license to steal exists naturally, only curbed by others ability to use force to protect their assets.Government NEVER required banks to do what they did.
7939	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	They did it because they were short term thinkers who ignored the long term consequences of their actions, in order to gain the short term benefits.
7940	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	That has nothing to do with government, and everything to do with the modern business environment.
7941	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	The assumption that underlies most right wing economic thought is that we assume rational actors.
7942	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	The reality is, that assumption cannot accurately be made.
7943	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	People's actions are far too often irrational to make that assumption.
7944	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	The irrationality of the actions of bankers and people taking loans, combined with the artificially low interest rates(an idea advanced by Friedman), created this mess.
7945	frodly	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2040	So government had a role to play, but to say that very nearly all blame lies with government is beyond absurd.
7946	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	Oh, for crying out loud, Dan, I was only citing the NY Times to source the Greenspan quote, and I only used that because it was the first source Google found for me. Since there's no real dispute about what he said, I didn't feel the need to wade through the minutes of the Congressional hearing he said it at.
7947	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	:PAnd don't you see the irony of accusing the government of encouraging &quot;near illegal business practices&quot; considering that it's only the government's actions that make illegal practices illegal in the first place?
7948	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	Errr, what personal involvement?
7949	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	Obama was strictly a private citizen before Jan 2005, and not involved in the financial sector at all.
7950	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	And while I'm certainly not an expert, I don't recall any important financial legislation going through the Senate between then and Jan 2009.
7951	Kessy_Athena	SideTraKd	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2041	Unless someone can correct me on that?
7952	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2042	I certainly can.Although many other Senators and Representatives had a much deeper involvement with blocking meaningful reform at the GSEs, Obama himself was one of the top five recipients of funds from the GSEs during his term as Senator.
7953	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2042	During that time, Senate Bill 190 was released from committee favorably to the floor, but was never brought to debate because the Democrats made it very clear that they were in lockstep opposition to it, and Republicans did not have enough votes to push for it on their own.Obama was one of those Senators.
7954	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2042	http://www.govtrack.us/users/questio...=bill:s109-190This is the bill that McCain unsuccessfully sought to revive during the election, and Obama refused to do so, even though, by then, the problem was VERY apparent to anyone that was paying attention to it, and had grown far worse even just since the bill was first released from committee.Now, that does nothing to say that Obama was anywhere near as involved as certain others, especially Dodd, who had so much involvement with the housing crash that he literally retired at the end of his term.
7955	SideTraKd	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2042	But Mr. Obama's current rhetoric on the causes of our economic situation simply flies in the face of reality, and he is far more culpable for the situation than he would like anyone to believe.

7974	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	&quot;Climate fraud&quot;?
7975	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	And you accuse liberals of drinking kool-aid?
7976	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Come on Dan, the debate over the reality of climate change is over.
7977	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	It ended 29 August 2005.
7978	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The evidence that it is happening is absolutely overwhelming at this point, and trying to pretend there's a scientific debate about it is about on a level with the big tobacco execs going before Congress back in the 80's and saying that they didn't believe that their product is addictive or causes disease.If you're thinking of the so called climategate email - the one that said something about finding a trick to hide the decline - I'm afraid you've been bamboozeled.
7979	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	That was one email out of more then a thousand, taken completely out of context and given a heaping helping of innuendo.
7980	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Using those methods, you could make almost anyone look like an ax murderer.
7981	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The trick was as in, &quot;Hey, I just learned a great new trick for solving differential equations,&quot; and the general context was a discussion of finding a way to integrate very different kinds of data into a coherent whole.
7982	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Which usually ain't easy, let me tell you.
7983	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The people involved in that email have had their work gone over with a fine toothed comb, and absolutely no wrong doing or data manipulation has been found.
7984	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The worst they were guilty of was griping about having to hand their raw data over to someone they felt would misuse it.And even if you chose not to believe that, you could throw out the entire life's work of those guys and there would still be a mountain of evidence saying that climate change is real and it is happening.
7985	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	In some cases literal mountains - alpine glaciers have been retreating dramatically around the world for decades.
7986	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	You have the historical climate records of the last century or two, ice cores from Greenland, Antarctica, and alpine glaciers from around the world, tree ring data from around the world, lake and ocean sediment evidence from around the world - all of which point to the exact same thing: CO2 levels in the atmosphere have spiked and temperatures are rising dramatically.The debate now is about how bad the effects are really going to be, and how much we can and should do about it.And even if you still insist on denying climate change, how can you seriously argue that getting off of fossil fuels, particularly oil, is an important and urgent priority?
7987	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Being depending on oil imports form the Middle East has big and obvious political and economic effects.
7988	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	And we've hit peak oil - even with improving technology the total amount of oil produced is going to start an inexorable decline from now on.
7989	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	That plus the surging demand for oil from rapidly developing parts of the world like India and China...
7990	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	supply and demand, anyone?And before you start saying that the market will take care of it...
7991	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	We've known since the 70's that we need to get off of oil, and what has the private sector done about it?
7992	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Not a thing.
7993	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	We've been sitting on our thumbs for decades.
7994	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	The Brazilians, for example, have not.
7995	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	They decided after the oil shocks of the 70's that they were going to be energy independent, and guess what?
7996	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	They are.
7997	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Thanks to determined action, the Brazilian economy mostly runs on home grown sugar cane ethanol - they import virtually no oil at all.Oil prices are going to start going up inexorably from now on, that's just a fact of life.
7998	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	If that rise is gradual, sure, then the market will be able to deal with it.
7999	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	But what if it's not gradual?
8000	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	We saw just a few years ago that prices can spike dramatically in a very short amount of time, even without things like terrorism or international politics getting involved.
8001	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	What if oil prices double in a month - for several months in a row?
8002	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2052	Is that a risk worth taking?
8003	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	Once again you do it.There are 2 paragraphs highlighted.
8004	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	You pick the first onlt and then drone on and on with opinion stated as fact.
8005	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	Your unceasing habit.
8006	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	You believe Climate Change to be a reality, but no such FACTUAL reality has been proven.
8007	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	I'm not saying it is not real, I'm very doubtful as climate does fluctuate, but I don't know either way.
8008	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	But you ignored the second and more important paragraph.
8009	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2053	If BHO IS deeply involved in the CCX, then he serves only his bank account when talking about energy bills, not the USA.
8010	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	And once again you do it, trying to ignore inconvenient facts by labeling them as opinions.It is a fact that the evidence for anthropogenic climate change is overwhelming, not an opinion, and even cursory research would tell you that.
8011	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	And you completely ignore the fact that the real concrete goal of cap and trade is to get us off of fossil fuels.But, since you want me to directly address President Obama's personal involvement in CCX, let's review:
8012	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	Noungrant (plural grants)1.
8013	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	The act of granting; a bestowing or conferring; concession; allowance; permission.2.
8014	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	The yielding or admission of something in dispute.3.
8015	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	The thing or property granted; a gift; a boon.4.
8016	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	A transfer of property by deed or writing; especially, au appropriation or conveyance made by the government; as, a grant of land or of money; also, the deed or writing by which the transfer is made.Nounfoundation (plural foundations)4.
8017	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	A donation or legacy appropriated to support a charitable institution, and constituting a permanent fund; endowment.5.
8018	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	That which is founded, or established by endowment; an endowed institution or charity.You will note the distinct lack of words like &quot;loan&quot; &quot;investment&quot; or &quot;repayment&quot; in these definitions.
8019	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	How then does the Joyce Foundation have any financial interest in the worth of CCX?
8020	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	And even if they did, how would that financially benefit President Obama?
8021	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	Being a former board member does not give him a financial stake in it.
8022	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	And even if he did have some sort of investment in it, which I don't think is even possible with a charitable foundation, Obama's assets have been put in a blind trust, like all Presidents.
8023	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2054	So, Dan, I'm afraid your logic fails not once, not twice, but three times.
8024	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2055	Naive, to infinity.
8025	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2055	CCX is not a charitable foundation.
8026	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2056	Nooooo, but the Joyce Foundation is. And you still have three gaps in your argument to bridge.
8027	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2057	Not too many take out newspaper adds of their corruption.
8028	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2057	They don't want you liberals looking too foolish.

8045	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	Climate change!!!!!!!!!!!Now I'm more than a bit older than you, but still I've been around for well less than a century.
8046	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	A mere 70 years.In that time I've lived thru:A cold period in a general warming trend.A warming period in a general cooling trend.A very warm period of a general warming trend.A very cold period of a general cooling trend.Stable periods in a generally unstable climate.Unstable periods in a generally stable climate.ALL of the above have been &quot;official&quot; decrees by learned people that study such climatic events.All of the above are not possible in one short lifetime, yet they all have been official proclamations.Now we are told that we have warmed up a small part of A DEGREE since 1900.
8047	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	Less than one half of one degree warmer now than it was 110 years ago.
8048	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	In order for that to be true, we must assume that temperature recordings in 1900 were accurate to within less than one half of one degree.
8049	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2070	So do you BELIEVE that temp recordings 110 years ago were accurate to within 100% to 99.75%I have very serious doubts that they were.
8050	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Well, in order to decide what to make of something like changing pronouncements on where the climate is going, it helps to understand a bit about the nature of science.
8051	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Science is never absolutely certain, and is never finished.
8052	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	The basic premise of science is to admit that neither a researcher or their instruments can ever be perfect - you do the best you can, make an estimate of how close you figure you probably got to the truth, and then leave the best record you can as a guide to the next person to come along and tackle the problem.
8053	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	That's true of even the most well established and respected theories in science.
8054	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Take the theory of gravity - it doesn't get much more certain then gravity, does it?
8055	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	And yet just a few years ago NASA sent up a satellite called Gravity Probe B to try and poke holes in it.
8056	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	As far as scientists are concerned, it's a win win - if they can find holes, then they can address them and make the theory better, and if they can't, it increases the confidence they have in the theory.So I'm not really sure what &quot;official pronouncements&quot; you may have heard, but I can guarantee that no peer reviewed article would have made such a claim with absolute certainty.
8057	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	In fact, I figure it's more then likely that what you heard wasn't coming from scientists at all; it was probably the news media taking some tentative research and blowing it up to make a good headline.
8058	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	You know how people complain that one day scientists say that food X will make you live a hundred years, and the next day they're saying it'll kill you?
8059	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	That's not science doing that, that's the media.
8060	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	A scientist will say, &quot;Well, after following so many people for so many years who were eating so much of food X, we saw the following outcomes.&quot; Science is in the business of dealing with very complex and hard to understand things, it's in the business of nuance.
8061	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	As I think we all know, the news media doesn't much care for complexity or nuance.So, does all this apply to climate change?
8062	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Yes.
8063	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Are scientists absolutely certain that human caused climate change is happening?
8064	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	No.
8065	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Could it turn out later that this was all a big mistake, a misinterpretation of faulty data or something?
8066	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Absolutely.
8067	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Then why should we listen to warnings of climate change?
8068	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Because life never gives us certainties, and all we can do is make the best decisions we can with what we have.Generally speaking, science gets better as time goes on.
8069	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	What a scientist says today is going to be more reliable then what they were saying yesterday.
8070	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Global warming has been a major topic of research for a good thirty years now, and as time goes on, the evidence that it is happening has mounted, and the uncertainties shrunken, until today there is consensus in the scientific community that the evidence overwhelmingly says it is happening.
8071	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	It's about as certain as science ever gets about anything.In fact, the uncertainty is now so low that the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) have issued quite literally unprecedented statements about climate change.
8072	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	They're saying that climate change is happening, we're the ones doing it, it's going to be bad, and we'd better do something about it.
8073	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	The AAAS and NAS have *never* issued a call to action like that before, about anything.
8074	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Why should you listen to them?
8075	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Because they're the most prestigious, most well respected organizations of the smartest, most well informed, and geekiest people on the planet.
8076	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	They've been around since the mid nineteenth century and have huge reputations to protect - their reputations are their bread and butter.
8077	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	There are probably no organizations on the planet with a stronger reason to make sure they never ever say anything that could later make them look foolish.
8078	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	These guys are the crown jewels of science, and what they say is about as close as you're going to get to an official pronouncement of what science knows.
8079	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	If you're not convinced by what they say, then nothing from science will ever convince you of anything.And it's not just the scientists.
8080	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	The Pentagon takes climate change so seriously that they didn't even consider the question of its reality in the February 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and went directly to considering how to deal with its effects.
8081	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	There's even an organization of major industries called US Climate Action Partnership calling for immediate action on the issue, that includes companies like Alcoa, Ford, GM, Chrysler, GE, Dow and Dupont.
8082	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	These are some of the companies that are going to be most directly effected by action to tackle climate change, and they're saying we need to do it, now.If you're not going to believe these guys, who are you going to believe?
8083	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Seriously, that's not a rhetorical question.
8084	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2071	Who are you going to believe?AAAS statement: http://www.aaas.org/news/releases/20...tatement.shtmlNAS statement: http://www7.nationalacademies.org/oc...get_Review.aspFeb 2010 QDR, p. 84, Crafting a Strategic Approach to Climate and Energy http://www.defense.gov/qdr/QDR%20as%...N10%201600.pdfUSCAP homepage: http://www.us-cap.org/
8085	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2073	Youngster, many,,,,,,Thousands,,,,,,,,,,Maybe millions of very definitive statements were made by scientists, writers, reporters, mathematicians, farmers, etc.etc. Definitive statements on about every subject imaginable.
8086	Dan40	Kessy_Athena	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2073	All before our present ridiculous &quot;Age of Political Correctness.&quot; Now none open their mouths without &quot;plausible deniability.&quot;The fact that few have the stones to make a statement today, does not mean that it was not commonly done in the past.
8087	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	Hey, I'm not saying that scientists aren't just as human as everyone else.
8088	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	We all have a bad tendency to overstate our certainty at times, including me. But the basic principles of the scientific method have been firmly established for centuries.
8089	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	And there's a big difference between what a scientist may say in casual conversation, or even when being interviewed by a reporter, and what they put in their formal articles for peer reviewed publications.There is no such thing as absolute certainty, ever.
8090	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	None of us are infallible, and we all believe things now that will later turn out to be wrong.
8091	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	You me, everyone.
8092	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	And science is in the business of not only being aware of that inherent uncertainty in life, but to actually quantify it.
8093	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	And the uncertainty we have in the reality of climate change is now really really small.
8094	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	I mean, think about it - is the Pentagon in the habit of chasing after the latest intellectual fad?
8095	Kessy_Athena	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2074	If the military takes climate change seriously enough to devote significant resources to planning for its effects, don't you think that maybe you should take it seriously too?
8096	MegadethFan	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2075	I know what you mean, old people are really dumb in America, and they tend to be very politically correct when it comes to Israel.

8100	Dan40	Agent_286	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2079	At this point in time before the 2008 mistake, his unbelievable incompetence, obamalama had not announced he was running to destroy the presidency.
8101	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2081	Yes, the Republicans have a tall order to fill, but with Obama still at the helm, and Reid still in charge of the Senate, it will most likely be gridlock, which is not so bad when you look at Obama's agenda.
8102	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2081	There is still plenty of Democratic face in Washington.

8112	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2083	He'll be able to beat Obama because the Dems are too timid (read politically inept) to nominate a candidate with a stainless steel backbone and political acumen sufficient to beat the Fox News corporate, propaganda machine.

8211	Dan40	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2108	So between now and the 2012 elections a dozen or more candidates can appear in the limelight.

8289	Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2141	The issue was hardly that Japan thought the US would be a quiky.
8290	Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2141	Roosevelt was thirsting for war, and did everything in his power to provoke it (as the Congress was staunchly isolationist).
8291	Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2141	To quote the United States General Hugh Johnson: &quot;I know of no well informed Washington observer who isn't convinced that, if Mr. Roosevelt is elected (in 1940), he will drag us into war at the first opportunity, and that, if none presents itself, he will make one.&quot;He wasn't so concerned with Japan, but rather Hitler and seized upon the opportunity the Axis' tripartite agreement afforded.

8293	Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2141	So he had to settle for oil embargos (which I fully support, by the way, but that's neither here nor there).No one is going to be attacking America, a nation of over 300 million people and the size of the European continent, a nation which has the strongest army, airforce, and navy every known, the nation that hosts the UN and the worlds financial headquarters.

8308	Dan40	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2144	Or that N Korea or Iran is not insane enough to attack us.And an attack on us was unthinkable, BY US, in the 30's too.
8309	Dan40	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2144	But Japan thought that a single devastating blow would cause us to sue for peace.

8326	Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2146	Nor am I attempting to argue that the Axis used methods differing from the above when attacking the US.
8327	Plymouth	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2146	What I am saying, however, is that our involvement in WWII was not because the rest of the world thought we were &quot;pansies.&quot; It would be analogous to somebody attacking an even better armed China, the rising military and economic power of the time, on the virtue of them being perceived as &quot;weak.&quot; Obviously no sentiments like that exist today; such was the case in 1938 as well.

8362	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2160	No Obamas liberal ideas (ie abortion), gross ignorance of economic affairs, and lack of executive experience are a few of many defects which disqualify him as presidential material.
8363	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2160	I don't consider personal appearance when voting for a man, if I said why that is so, I may get an infraction.
8364	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2160	Anyway, look at Obama, he looks like a cross between Barney Fife and Dumbo with those ears.

8391	Plymouth	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2164	Nor is it likely that a single Christian president has ever crafted a single policy in error.

8405	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2166	Nor is International politics as simple as cause and effect which depends on logic, far from anything remotely applicable to international politics.

8410	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2166	That's why you self described &quot;non-practicing heathens dream of Marxist utopias in which Muslims actually have rights and people abort children for fun&quot; will never make president, thank God.
8411	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2166	BTW, most abortions aren't for fun, but rather something nearly as sinister and repulsive, they are performed for convenience of the mom and dad.

8429	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	I was using the dual slit experiment as an analogy.
8430	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	The analogy demonstrated that we can know to a degree of probability which slit the particle will take.
8431	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	We know these type of probabilities well enough to make calculations and the probabilistic outcome of these calculations are accurate enough to design circuits.
8432	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	just as I pointed out.
8433	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	Nevertheless, even though we know with an exceedingly high degree which slit the particle will take there is still a chance that the particle will do the unexpected and take the slit that it 'shouldn't' according to the rules of probability.
8434	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	The circuit may fail if that happens.
8435	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	That's bad for circuits but good for people because that tiny fractional lee way is the room we require for free will to exist.
8436	RevAnarchist	Plymouth	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2169	That is because if God knew with an accuracy of 100% exactly the future and what choices we would make our free will would not, and could not exist.

8492	MegadethFan	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2194	Socialism requires some fundamental and core ideas, namely communal ownership of the 'means of production', which Obama has not slightly indicated moving to.
8493	MegadethFan	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2194	And of course, along side this, the eradication of 'private property' as institutionalized legal procedure.
8494	MegadethFan	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2194	Obama has not even contemplated this.

8496	MegadethFan	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2194	His definition of world governance is far different to yours.
8497	MegadethFan	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2194	His is of legal structure - which for America is rather hard to grasp, but not for Europeans who have learned the hard way.
8498	MegadethFan	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2194	In terms of direct management no one is contemplating this, but you are suggesting, in fact loudly purporting that this is his aim.

8505	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Allow me another ?; I do mean to, and usually do say that unless an wayward Freudian slip encroaches upon my published internet font, my verbiage and other presentations will proclaim that Obama merely cleaves heavily to all things socialist, and often adopts those things which is far more dangerous than even a military solution in some cases.
8506	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	The issue isn't not how much he spent but rather the way he spends our money.
8507	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	As I said I am claiming that he is trending towards socialism.
8508	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	In reality I beleive he was and is setting up the necessary culture as preparing wall street and other 'infrastructure' to allow a easy transition to a socialist system
8509	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	I would wager you are wrong about that!
8510	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	I am sure he has contemplated the dream of world wide socialism with the USA being leading the charge down the path to national poverty or worse!
8511	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	World governance is world governance.

8514	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	It's manifesting as bankrupt economies, bankrupt citizens, hungry people, and other failures which are resulting in civil disobedience, protests in the streets, and social unrest!
8515	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	No you Europeans can keep all that, including the international world court.
8516	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	BTW, we are a sovereign nation with a Constitution that grantees our rights and security, additionally that same constitution does not allow other countries to meddle in our affairs.
8517	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Obama is naive that seeks to appease instead of having a spine.

8522	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	So, MD, I hope and pray that we will get Obama out of office before anything else bad happens.

8526	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	In fact at least one of these people has said in print that he enjoys destroying national economies (or playing the game that leads up to destroying that nations currency etc).
8527	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2195	Well, with all due respect the ignorance you speak of is deposited in piles and heaps in your camp.

8598	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	Interesting commentary and heavily weighed in &quot;Southern&quot; philosophy, I suggest.
8599	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	I mostly grew up in the &quot;south&quot; but my higher education is midwest where I was taught &quot;how&quot; to think critically, not &quot;what&quot; to think critically, as my youthful years outlined.
8600	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	I have a summa cum laude degree in Philosophy/Political Science and 2 grad years in Christian theology.
8601	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	That foundation tells me that fundamental Christian philosophy is grounded in socialist philosophy -- as the NT Book of Acts clearly demonstrates.
8602	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	Much of American fundamental Christian theology today is grounded in the OT.
8603	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	It is implied that Christians are now heir to the OT promises of Jewish wealth and favoritism because of their faith and belief in the &quot;Christ&quot; known as Jesus.
8604	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	In point of fact -- if we cite the King James version of the &quot;Bible&quot; -- the &quot;Apostle&quot; Paul is the father of the Christian philosophy inasmuch as it was he who carried the Christian philosophy to the pagan world.
8605	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	Insofar as the NT is concerned, it is not recorded that Jesus ever preached to any others than the Jewish community.
8606	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	Wall Street going &quot;socialist?&quot; Let me see.
8607	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	Just recently, it is reported that American business has moved 40K factories to China, leaving Americans without jobs.
8608	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	Then there's the WTO wherein the rules governing trade supersede the American Constitution in a court of law.
8609	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	These significant actions et.
8610	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	al. took place long before Obama became President; and NAFTA and Wall Street deregulation took place under Clinton, with the blessing of neoconservative Republicans who also pushed vigorously for the war in Iraq.
8611	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	One answer to that conclusion: WTO!!!!
8612	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	I suggest you do some hard-pressed &quot;Goolging&quot; research to find the fallacy in your opinion quoted above.
8613	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	Hitler would have killed a Christian like Obama as he did to many Christians during his attempt to conquer the industrialized world.
8614	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	I would seriously suggest that Obama isn't &quot;dumber than a rock&quot; anymore than your implication suggests that you think your intellect is superior to his.
8615	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	&quot;God help us if the poo really hits the fan?&quot; if your opinion reflects that by a majority of voters in the next conservative, Tea (&quot;t&quot; stands for trouble) Party Republican led election.
8616	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	How about putting a name to that declaration?
8617	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	Or a link to the source?
8618	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	How about we Americans just, like you conservative &quot;fraidy cats,&quot; all stick our heads in the sand and &quot;hide&quot; from the rest of the world?
8619	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2228	How's that for abetting our own extinction?

8622	kk8	Rapunzel	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2230	I have agreed with everything you have said, and thought exactly the same way everytime.
8623	flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	The problem is they would never replace him, I imagine they would be too worried as to what their base would do.
8624	flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	The turn out for an election would drop through the floor PG.
8625	flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	I liked Clinton, she was a wealth of experience.
8626	flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	I may not often agree with her but besides being smart she has common sense.
8627	flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	I think with Obama if he did not learn it in a book he's stumped, and he has that Chicago approach to politics.Now if Obama steps down for the good of the party that would be different, but for a Democrat to challenge him,,,that would be out In my opinion...Even though I am conservative, I think it's a shame if Clinton never gets a chance to run again.
8628	flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	She is one of the few Democratic Icons left...How the Democrats took Obama over her I will never understand,,,ever.Personally I think it was a set up...Lets face it they were never going to go with Edwards, they knew about the affair, and then when Edwards backed Obama it was pretty clear what was planned.
8629	flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	Why would he choose Obama over Clinton?
8630	flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	Did he honestly think he was the better choice?
8631	flounder	Political Guardian	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2231	Most experienced politicians would not agree with that, not if they were thinking about the good of the country anyway.
8632	MegadethFan	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2233	You jealous?

8636	MegadethFan	MaxGeorgeDicksteinXXXI	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2238	The US, imho, would see its approval rating triple world wide if it elected him.
8637	MegadethFan	MaxGeorgeDicksteinXXXI	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2238	He wants to disband the empire (sell bases, disband the CIA etc) - that and endorse actual capitalist policy (cut protectionism, cut taxes, cut subsidies, give back third world sovereignty etc) which would see his Presidency as one of the best.
8638	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	Maybe I do need to lighten up a bit on Obama.
8639	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	I have already much soften my views.
8640	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	I was especially critical of his policies and him personally during the first year of his presidency.
8641	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	Lately he is trying to be more conservative, and he did not do all the harmful leftist things he promised his supporters.
8642	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	His health care bill or at least the most harmful socialist aspects of it will likely be repealed.
8643	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	I was worried about the silence of the moderately conservative americans thinking they had been secretly abducted by Obama aliens and lobotomized or brainwashed into believing that he was the true messiah and could do no wrong!
8644	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; attepted humor&lt;&lt;&lt;.Anyway, I am now satisfied that there is some backbone and the brainwashing is wearing off.
8645	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	Everyone except for the despicable god awful stomach turning pundits like Keith Oberman and even the less abrasive and easier on the ears and stomach Matthews has moderated in our general citizenship.
8646	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	Still Obama is one of our most dangerous presidents and not the Icon that the majority of USA citizens beleive.
8647	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	My biggest concern is does our president know that he is harming and has harmed us?
8648	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	Or does he beleive that we should really start down the slippery slope to one-worldism, and national socialism?
8649	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	If the latter be true, then is is worse than our most dangerous president in history, ie Abraham Lincoln.
8650	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2239	Please, if I have offended anyone* by saying that about Lincoln ask me why I think Lincoln, who is loved by the world and most Americans, shouldn't be an icon or even respected as an upholder of the Constitution etc. I use Lincoln often to drive home a point so my thoughts are not meant to be flammable but rather educational.ra.
8651	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2240	I would elect Ron Paul NOW, except for a few (which I beleive he would agree to moderate) for a few of his proposed policies.
8652	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2240	I most admire him for his position of isolationism of USA, but don't think he goes far enough.
8653	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2240	I would work to win over the entire western hemisphere.
8654	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2240	I like his position on taxes and as well.
8655	RevAnarchist	MegadethFan	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2240	Some of his critics fear his polices would weaken the USA.

8761	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	Without that strong underlying system the under reimbursing Medicare/Medicaid programs would collapse.2.
8762	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	How is the &quot;efficiency&quot; achieved?
8763	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	It is achieved by contracting out to INSURANCE COMPANIES, the total day to day administration of Medicare/Medicaid claims.
8764	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2275	Govt workers are NOT the ones doing the work.
8765	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	Correct!
8766	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	Every working person has a SS account and pays premiums into that account until retirement.
8767	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	It is labeled a &quot;trust&quot; fund, but it isn't.
8768	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	If Congress did not &quot;raid&quot; that &quot;trust&quot; in order to pay for items called &quot;discretionary,&quot; like Bratboy Bush's Republican Congress passing &quot;supplemental&quot; bills to fund the 2 wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, SS and Medicare would be in the black for not just the baby boomers but their grand children.
8769	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	Correct again, which clearly SHOWS THAT MEDICARE IS NOT GOVERNMENT RUN OR A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER!!!!!!!!!!!
8770	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	The Administration of Medicare is a &quot;bid&quot; contract just like every other government contract; EXCEPT for example in the case of a Bratboy Bush campaign donor or crony (aka Dick Cheney) like Halliburton and Blackwater.
8771	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	(Aside, off topic)Want to view some fact filled info that is sorely lacking on today's media, I recommend viewing, online, last night's Frontline broadcast, &quot;Are We Safer; Flying Cheaper; The Spy Who Quit.&quot; Just for the &quot;fraidy cat&quot; conservatives who are all too willing to sacrifice their &quot;rights&quot; for the old adage, &quot;We can't be too safe.&quot; Further note: I totally disagree with the Afghan Intelligence Head who quit because he wants Americans to stay in Afghanistan to win their war for them.
8772	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	If the Afghans want democracy, they will have to be willing to fight and sacrifice for it themselves.
8773	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2278	It is NOT the job of Americans to fight for democracy anywhere but here on our own soil.
8774	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	First you say, and I quote: &quot;The medicare program is one of the most efficient programs in history, even if one compares it to &quot;private&quot; business.&quot;Then you agree with me that it is efficient BECAUSE it is done by PRIVATE INSURANCE companies.And then you go off on a Bush Cheney rant about spending.Do you know the worst spending of the Bush era came after Jan 2007?
8775	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	It is a fact!
8776	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	Jan 2007 is when the Democrats took TOTAL control of both the House and the Senate.
8777	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	With that spending included, the EIGHT YEARS under Bush saw our national debt increase by $5 TRILLION dollars.
8778	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	You want to say that is AWFUL and I will totally agree with you.
8779	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	Now I say that in just TWO YEARS under the obamalama our national debt has increased by $4 TRILLION dollars.
8780	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	I'm old and not up on 'the new math,' so you tell me which is worse.
8781	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	$5 TRILLION over EIGHT YEARS [$625 Billion per year average], or $4 TRILLION over 2 years?
8782	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2279	[$2 TRILLION per year average]But we are in agreement that politicians of both parties have raided the &quot;trust funds&quot; with regularity and impunity.
8783	Jollee	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2280	2.7 billion dollars in welfare and Medical benefits in one year payable in LA County alone, where is your state?

8790	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Not at all.
8791	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Just because a private company gets the contract doesn't make it &quot;more efficient.&quot; The government sets the guidelines for the product and the company who wins the contract.
8792	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	It is proved time and time again that &quot;waste&quot; in government contracts is propagated thru &quot;loopholes&quot; (which I showed in an earlier post how lack of oversight can cost millions).
8793	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Why is that?
8794	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Mostly because there aren't sufficient people in the bureaucracy to check every figure on the invoice, especially, if there's a loophole not covered in the contract.
8795	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	There is fraud in Medicare because, e.g. a doctor commits fraud by using medicare accounts for procedures not done without the patient's knowledge.
8796	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	The point I wanted to make about Bush/Cheney is that the money used for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was NEVER included in the Budget.
8797	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	NEVER!!!
8798	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	The wars were (note I say, &quot;WERE&quot;) paid for by supplemental appropriations passed by Congress.
8799	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Those bills are still being paid for in the national debt.
8800	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	I don't have time to &quot;check&quot; your figures and unless you can give me an &quot;unbiased&quot; source for them, excuse me, if I doubt the figures you quote are accurate or realistic.Yes, we do agree about the raid on the SS trust fund.
8801	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	It is shameful.
8802	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	Now you neoconservatives want to repeal it, taking away from people the promise of dignity in old age they have paid for in a lifetime of work.
8803	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2284	IOW, they will NOT be getting what they paid for.
8804	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2285	Read 'em and weep!http://www.usdebtclock.org/http://thenationaldebtcrisis.com/the...-by-president/http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/r...ebt_histo5.htmOr do you wish to argue the treasury direct figures?Not FOX, not the RNC, but the US treasury official figures.And remember the figures in the second link.
8805	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2285	Bush over $3 Trillion in his last 4 years--------------the last 2 years of which were under a controlling majority of ALL of Congress by the Democratic Party.
8806	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2285	Or do you wish to argue that too?The simple net answers are:Bush WAS bad.
8807	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2285	$625 billion per year added to the debt!
8808	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2285	BHO is much, much, much WORSE.
8809	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2285	$2 TRILLION PER YEAR ADDED TO THE DEBT The figures, in this case, don't lie.
8810	VectorFL	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2286	Yeah.
8811	VectorFL	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2286	And, if one good thing came out of the Carter Presidency, it was followed by 12 years of Republican control.
8812	onalandline	VectorFL	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2287	Reagan was one of our better ones in modern history.
8813	Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2288	One way that could be helped is increase the amount of Legal immigrants allowed per year.
8814	Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2288	It would decrease the lines to get in and would make it easier to come legally, possibly causing those who come illegally to consider doing it the right way...
8815	Hijothis	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2289	If not the best...
8816	flounder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2290	That does not sound bad, however I doubt it would slow illegal immigration and all you would do is add to the numbers.
8817	flounder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2290	The fellow on the other side who is waiting , does not want to wait period.
8818	flounder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2290	That just wont change.We have to stop giving these people so much and thus make it less attractive, it's the only way.
8819	flounder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2290	Why people do not understand entitlements encourage greed and illegals I just dont get.
8820	flounder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2290	All you are doing is saying..here take this it's free, and the faster you get here the faster you will have it.
8821	flounder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2290	Oh and if you leave a baby your entire family will be welcome some day..We have raped our Constitution and we must straighten it out, why is it working for illegals and not us?Taking more in will just increase the total numbers, because no matter your increase others will still be waiting.
8822	flounder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2290	Not to mention we will always get the criminals.
8823	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2291	Not really.
8824	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2291	Now you switch the topic from &quot;spending&quot; to &quot;debt.&quot; My emphasis is on &quot;spending&quot; to complement &quot;ideology.&quot;Neoconservative Republicans ALWAYS talk about &quot;less government, lower taxes, (and since Reagan and the majority Republican Congress during Clinton), about deregulation for big business and Wall Street.
8825	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2291	Nothing new here.
8826	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2291	Just about everyone shutters at the rising debt!

8828	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2291	However, I quote the salient information as follows.
8829	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2291	&quot;Bolding&quot; is mine to highlight the disclaimer:

8831	Sassy	Cicero1964	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2291	We can argue the debt increase and it will likely increase every year simply because the dollar continues to be devalued.
8832	Sassy	Cicero1964	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2291	The dollar value today is NOT the value it was 50 years ago.

8859	Giftedone	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2292	not finger pointing by fools ( fool being defined as those that make unsubstantiated accusations)
8860	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	If you care to go and find the statistics, the 2 wars are not that large a percentage of our spending.
8861	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	Military spending is a large part, but not the &quot;2 wars.&quot; And you are an out and out liberal, NOT an independent.
8862	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	If it looks like a liberal, and it talks like a liberal, and it thinks like a liberal, and it smells like a liberal, its a liberal.And, remember, Obama inherited the Bush spending debt, including TARP, 2 wars and the &quot;donut hole.&quot;As I pointed out to you earlier, the largest spending AND increase in our debt in the Bush Presidency was after Jan 2007 when Democrats took TOTAL control of all of Congress.
8863	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	Spending and debt increase tripled Bush's previous 6 year average under the Democrat control.
8864	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	And it was a Democrat Congress that passed TARP.
8865	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	Bush's blame is in signing it.
8866	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	Same as obamalama's blame is in signing $4 trillion in debt increase by signing the Democrat's bills.The national debt increased by $5 trillion dollars in 8 years under Bush.
8867	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	60% of that increase occurred in years 1 through 6 with a Republican Congress.
8868	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	40% of the increase occurred in years 7 and 8 under a Democratic Congress.As I constantly point out to your die hard liberal convictions, Bush WAS bad.
8869	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	BHO is many TIMES Worse.You projected an increase in the debt over $6 trillion in obamalama's FIRST [and please, please, please, ONLY] term.
8870	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2293	A TRILLION MORE than Bush in HALF the time.WHAT more do you need to know?
8871	Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2294	I agree.
8872	Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2294	It would lessen the frustration of the legals, but you are right, it would most likely no decrease the amounts of illegals.
8873	Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2294	And the fact that we make it so appetizing is 100% correct.
8874	Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2294	We give them everything free and let them &quot;anchor&quot; babies.The Fair Tax nails 'em though...
8875	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	You are to label me a &quot;liberal.&quot; I am NOT!
8876	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	You haven't any evidence of that other than I DISAGREE with you!!!!
8877	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	Fact is, at one time in my youth, I was a Republican precinct captain, and most of the folk there tended to call me a &quot;conservative.&quot; But when Reagan arrived on the scene, that was when I turned Independent and have been ever since.
8878	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	IMO, you are the one that smells!!!
8879	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	with your inability to provide sources for your radical statements.
8880	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	You are just like every other neoconservative, fiscally irresponsible when it comes to &quot;spending&quot; other people's money and then whine and blubber (like NeoSpeaker Boehner) about the deficit and debt.And, remember, Obama inherited the Bush spending debt, including TARP, 2 wars and the &quot;donut hole.&quot;
8881	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	Your &quot;unbiased&quot; sources that actually quote these figures!!!!!!
8882	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	It's NOT my job to confirm your figures.
8883	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	It's your JOB to do that!
8884	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	I am not your to help you prove your argument.
8885	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2296	I did find this (please note I DO PROVIDE AN UNBIASED SOURCE):
8886	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2297	Since you won't accept the Us Dept of the Treasury as a source which you have a link to examine their figures, go ahead and use ANY excuse you wish to use.From the US TreasuryUS national debt at 3 months prior to obamalama's inauguration:09/30/2008 $10,024,724,896,912.49 US national debt today: $14,071,897,000,000.Difference $4 TRILLION, 47 BILLION.Th wars were &quot;off Budget&quot; by Bush?
8887	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2297	That's your argument.
8888	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2297	That is hilarious since EVERYTHING is &quot;off budget&quot; by the grossly incompetent, world wide laughing stock, clown, obamalama since he does NOT have a budget yet!!!
8889	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	You further need to note that our national debt is stated in US dollars because it is OUR national debt.
8890	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	It is not in dollars vs. any other currency.
8891	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	WE owe China $1 Trillion United States Dollars, we do not owe them or anyone else the equivalent of a trillion dollars in their money.
8892	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	So the international value of the dollar does not effect our national debt.What can effect our national debt is our own INFLATION.And according to the Democrats in power since Jan 2007 until this month, there has been no inflation.Since 2008, [Bush's time] until now, according to our Govt.
8893	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	there has been no inflation, so that those receiving Govt paychecks with a COLA factor, have not received any increase since 2008.So our national debt today is the same as if it were stated in 2008 dollars.So go ahead and claim that the National debt clock site is biased, go ahead and claim that the US Treasury is biased, and go ahead and claim that its all inflation.
8894	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	Go ahead and keep your eyes and mind firmly closed to the indisputable FACT that the gross clown obamalama has blown $4 TRILLION Dollars in 2 years and we have no robust economy, and no low unemployment, and no booming housing market to show for the absolute WASTE of $4 Trillion Dollars.He blames the greed of Wall Street and the banks for our financial woes and then defends bailing out those same Wall Street firms and banks.
8895	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	He blames Insurance companies for the unaffordability of health care and then champions a bill that VASTLY expands insurance companies markets!Now he is claiming to be more business friendly and hires the CEO of GE.
8896	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2298	The company that finances the obamalama propaganda and advertising networks of NBC and MSNBC.I'd vote for a derelict living in a packing crate before I'd vote for the idiot we have in DC now.
8897	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	I repeat: Figures don't lie!
8898	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	But, Liars can figure.
8899	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Everything you post shows your contempt for ANY government, including those YOU did and do vote for.
8900	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Let me ask you this: What or where would you be without government?
8901	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Probably dead or suffering because the older you are, the weaker you are.
8902	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Even extraordinary wealth or the amount of health care you can purchase will not protect you from physical disability, disease, poor care or public disinterest.I repeat: Conservatives are &quot;Fraidy Cats&quot; and you are.
8903	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	You are as terrified of those who do not pose a threat as you are of those who do.
8904	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	You think government is out to &quot;get you.&quot; In stead, you place your trust in free trade, the WTO, corporate greed and -- this is true irony -- in an amoral political party that propagates its self interest and survival over the moral imperative intrinsic in the Constitution: Equal protection under the law, human dignity and freedom from human misery.
8905	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	That's exactly what I thought you would do/have done, and that &quot;idiot&quot; would still have more concern for your well being than any neoconservative pundit, congressperson, evil-spirited Republican moron that spouts lies over facts, reveres dollars over human beings and global corporations over governments!
8906	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	PS: You still haven't provided a &quot;source&quot; for your rhetoric.
8907	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	Anyone can twist figures from any source and make them &quot;work&quot; for an imprecise conclusion.
8908	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	There are more factors in the simplistic &quot;debt&quot; numbers you use that &quot;mitigate&quot; the outcome you insist upon -- as is clearly demonstrated in the source I quoted.
8909	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2299	But, people with closed minds to anything other than their personal dogma are incapable of understanding that, even when it is an intrinsic point in the argument!
8910	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	You claim to be an independent not a liberal.
8911	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	Yet faced with indisputable facts you fall back on the stereotypical liberal ploy of insulting the intelligence of ANY that disagree with your closed minded opinions.The debt numbers are accurate, not put up by any left or right political propagandist.
8912	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	Your inability to see the truth is your own burden to bear, not mine to share.
8913	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	I am against the Governments that we have had LATELY.
8914	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	We went from bad to WORSE.In the past I've put my life on the line for our country, and our Government, VOLUNTARILY!

8916	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	What have YOU done for our country?I am a conservative independent and am tired of lying politicians of both sides.
8917	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	We need someone who DOES understand what public service means and they WANT to actually SERVE the public.
8918	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2300	Instead of lining their pockets and currying favors for when they leave public life.
8919	MegadethFan	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2301	Just wanted to highlight some idiocy in your post....
8920	MegadethFan	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2301	I can assure idiocy and insults are not confined to being a liberal or conservative.

8925	MegadethFan	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2301	Whilst I detest conservatives more than liberals, as a libertarian I totally agree.

8936	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	The church supports both with a 501c status which we use as a tax shelter etc. The members of the church ie Apocalyptic Bearer Of The Cross Church, A.B.O.T.C.C. actually own stock in the church and missions.This is all public record in Carter County Court house in Carter County TN.
8937	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Yes, a huge mega contradiction, kind of.

8948	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	The problem is that our species have not learned how to live in a society that does not need dominate, power hungry, economic males, so there is a square peg of those males trying to fit in the round hole of a modern world.
8949	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	In fact, if you could imagine a vast landscape of trillions of different shaped pegs trying to fit in trillions of different shaped holes, you would be imagining the modern world as I see it.

8952	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	As the baby boomers age and die, that process will accelerate for better or worse.

8955	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	If you are speaking about Obama’s toxic health care bill/tax , it has too many problems.
8956	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	The first is the mandatory requirement.
8957	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	I am not opposed to a health care system subsidized by the government if done right.
8958	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Obama’s Health care folly is an example of how NOT to create a health care system.
8959	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	I don’t really want to discuss Medicare etc. except to say it could have been self sufficient, and that is the prime requirement, fiscal balance.
8960	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	First I am of the opinion that due to the very effective character assassination by the media, as well as by her own faults of not being PC I wouldn’t want her to run for president until some time has passed say, eight years.
8961	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	If I were her handler, I would have her stop making blunders* and comments that are non PC.
8962	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Then I would groom her, for eight years, I guarantee at the end of that period she would sweep the election if conditions were as ‘anti Democrats’ as it is now.
8963	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	She is an highly intelligent woman (with an IQ that was estimated at 116.
8964	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Yes there was a fabricated fraud IQ test that indicated a score in the 80s and it has been making the internet rounds but it is fake and not validated).
8965	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	She has impeccable moral and ethical standards, so I believe she would make a great president.*(Blunders when viewed as someone running for president, she has made no ethical or moral blunders I am aware of)
8966	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	That statement is simply twaddle . She can be just as easily be indicted as a citizen as governor and we are still innocent until proven guilty, like it or not.
8967	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	She elected to quit the governorship to pursue a higher political office.
8968	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	Not to mention that she was giving up a job that 99% of us would kill for!
8969	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2306	So she actually made a personal sacrifice by giving up her desirable Governess position!

8974	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	You see ms. Sassy many liberals would have aborted her challenged child for their own convenience.

8976	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	No, those kinds of abortions are a natural crime called murder, and are beyond reprehensible.
8977	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	In contrast to a liberal pro death politico would do i.e. ; (abort for convenience) , what Palin did by keeping the child which she knew would need a lifetime of care is so unselfish and beautiful, so morally and ethically correct, I would voted for her nearly for that reason alone!
8978	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	And your ramblings and *cof* opinions are?

8981	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	Additionally, I would plead that you avoid making any derogatory claims about who possess common sense and who doesn’t! Again you may be accused of the same thing (lack of common sense) and it is too subjective a claim.
8982	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2307	For example; Many may think that you are a radical feminist holding a long festering grudge against white protestant males hoping to harm them by making hysterical and transparent claims where you focus that long festering beam of your rage in a blanket fashion ensnaring all those that claim any tidbit of libertarianism ? Hmm’ allow this libertarianism infected white Christian male to extend an even more repulsive (to many extremely extreme liberals) a bit of scriptural advice?

8992	RevAnarchist	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2308	Nevertheless, by the time he had won I had a quasi optimistic attitude that maybe he would be good for the country, despite some very large concerns over whom he may appoint for the SCOTUS, and other very important issues such as his record on late term abortion and abortion in general.
8993	RevAnarchist	Jiyuu-Freedom	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2308	Too bad he not only did not measure up his polices have brought the USA to the brink of collapse, in my opinion.

8998	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2311	The difference is huge.Communism takes *everything* primarily for the benefit of the state which redistributes equally.Liberals say that the quid pro quo of the benefits of capitalism is that you share *some* of the fabulous wealth you are allowed to generate and accumulate to provide safety nets for those who for don't have the market value for basic needs.

9001	RevAnarchist	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2312	The reason I say that is because to be a government the government must govern i.e. control its citizens.

9048	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	She's an opportunistic fraud.
9049	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	Every action she's taken is a prime example of self centered wealth based ambition.
9050	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	Some people can be self-educated, but she doesn't even read the newspapers.
9051	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	She has some skill with a &quot;quip&quot; but Tina Fey's characterization of Palin as a beauty pageant candidate is spot on.
9052	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2325	If she were blonde, she'd be called a &quot;dumb blonde.&quot;Go to page 2 for response to the rest of your post.
9053	MaxGeorgeDicksteinXXXI	(R)IGHTeous 1	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2326	I know, it's great
9054	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	This is a conclusion solely based on your Christian ideology.
9055	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Yes, Palin, at this point in time can well afford to care for her disabled child.
9056	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	But, she isn't &quot;relying on the Lord&quot; to provide care as most of those of the Christian faith expect a woman to do.
9057	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Anti-abortion advocates will encourage and even aid her to her decision to birth the baby, but she's on her own after that.
9058	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Hardly the &quot;Christian&quot; thing to do.
9059	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Nor are they willing to &quot;adopt&quot; that child to raise it, educate it until it is able to survive on its own.
9060	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	No, they let &quot;government&quot; do that.
9061	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	! Isn't this a case of the pot calling the kettle black?
9062	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	May I suggest you honor your own judgment applied to me.
9063	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	I agree, &quot;some&quot; libraries are better than others.
9064	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	That's true of the sources on the internet as well.
9065	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	But, anyone who can use a computer can save time by using it and the internet to research and learn.
9066	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	It is a tool.
9067	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	It can be a weapon.
9068	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2327	Like most man made tools, it best used with caution, reason and intelligence.
9069	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2328	Care to expand on that statement MD? I am speaking of the last sentence.
9070	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2328	~rr~ Perhaps he will answer from his/her understanding, but I've heard this before where Neoconservatism can be summed up pretty much as follows: Borrow and spend because deficits don't matter!
9071	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	Once again for your total enjoyment&quot;From the first day of George Washington's Presidency through the last day of Bill Clinton's Presidency, we racked up a total of $5 TRILLION Dollars of national debt.THAT was too much spending!Then George Bush took over, and increased the national debt from the $5 TRILLION left by Clinton, to $10 TRILLION at the end of Bush's 8 years.Bush, in only 8 years, equaled the total OVERspending by all Presidents before him.
9072	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	That is terrible.Then the obamalama comes in in Jan 2009 with a national debt of $10 TRILLION.
9073	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	Now its Jan 2011, TWO YEARS LATER, and the national debt stands at $14 TRILLION.
9074	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	In only 2 years he has equaled 80% of the awful amount Bush spent, and also equaled 80% of all Presidents combined from Clinton back to Washington.The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] projects our national debt will be $18 TRILLION at the end of 2015.Not FOX, not Republicans, but the CBO.And the CBO is projecting their number because of &quot;proposed&quot; spending reductions.The mathematical projection at today's rate of spending is $22 TRILLION of national debt by the end of 2015.$22,000,000,000,000.002015And what did the obamalama choose to talk about the most in his State of the Union campaign speech?
9075	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	'Investments!'
9076	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	That means MORE Govt spending, when we have only a little less than $00.60 cents for every dollar we are spending.
9077	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2329	Meaning, every dollar we spend, we have to borrow a bit over $00.40 cents.How hard could it be to find ANYONE that can do better than this incompetent clown?
9078	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	I am happy you spread the blame where it belongs, this is not a partisan issue, its an survival issue!
9079	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	That said, isn't the debt terrifying?
9080	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	I mean its absoultely horrifying!
9081	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	Some or maybe many of my virtual and regular friends think I am a bit eccentric as I build my new home/office to double as a 'bug out' shelter* of sorts.
9082	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	The building (Church and mission offices) and despite is fully off the grid capable, self sufficient in electrical power, including heating and cooling and can support two adults for over a year without restocking.
9083	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	I am not a nut but rather simply endowed with the inability to stick my head in the sand, and perhaps more important I am blessed with a normal dose of common sense.
9084	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	It's obvious me that we can not sustain anywhere near the level of spending that we seem to think is normal!
9085	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	I would urge everyone get prepared with a survival plan and options should the worst happen.
9086	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2330	God bless all of you.~rr~

9088	RevAnarchist	(R)IGHTeous 1	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2331	Great minds think alike!

9090	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2332	Yes I agree.
9091	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2332	BTW I will reply to your rebuttal ASAP.
9092	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2332	I need a coupld hours to nod~rr~
9093	RevAnarchist	Sassy;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Hi Sassy, I didn't have time to edit this thing for grammar so I hope its Legible ! I am so very aware of that falsehood and its simply paranoia often and, with all due respect it&#8217;s a rank falsehood.
9094	RevAnarchist	Sassy;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I have heard it so often I know where you are going with this.
9095	RevAnarchist	Sassy;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Even if the recipients of theistic giving receives a huge dose of religion with the goodies, they still definitely are getting assistance etc! Your logic is so fallible in that statement that I nearly didn&#8217;t read the rest of your reply, except to give it a cursory glance and dumbed down reply.
9096	RevAnarchist	Sassy;	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	However I took a chance that you were not being totally malicious and decided to give your reply the benefit of the doubt and I am happy I did, because you made some good points.
9097	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Well most school children know that Christian missionaries are umm&#8217; &#8230;.Christian missionaries!
9098	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	It&#8217;s not like they are going to get ambushed, or given small pox infected blankets along with a what would Jesus do/ love your fellow man tract!
9099	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	That is such a repetitively harped message it would be comical Sassy!
9100	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	If I offer assistance by my missions yes you may exposed to some awful things including but not limited seeing a bible on my desk or a bit of scripture on the walls.
9101	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	You may even be asked to come to church, however you wont be bushwhacked from out of the blue!
9102	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Anyone that comes to a church knows that they just might be exposed to Jesus stuff!
9103	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	The good news is (in addition to scripture) that secular organizations will charge cash for their services or food etc. If you have no cash you will starve or be denied the services.
9104	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	However, our clients will not be turned away unless they are a danger to themselves or our staff.
9105	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	(when I was up and running).
9106	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Yes indeedy!
9107	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Giving stuff away is unprofitable!
9108	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	And you are failing again in your logic.
9109	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	All taxpayers pay taxes, not just profitable taxpayers, ha ha.
9110	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Wrong.
9111	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	However I will say that some missions could be seen an endeavor in socialism.
9112	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	That&#8217;s a given eh?
9113	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	In fact Jesus would be a communist if he were alive today.
9114	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	However I already replied to your concerns.
9115	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I said that I am not an libertarian in every respect, I went to pains to point that out.
9116	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I believe that because of a perversion of society which was accomplished by embracing an paradigm of progressive liberalism and by accepting logical positivism (over metaphysics) we are forced to adopt some tenets of socialism.
9117	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	The early church was a form of socialism.
9118	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I have never said all socialism is bad have I?
9119	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	There is no black and white in anything in this temporal universe, (ie our tangible universe).
9120	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Trust me, everything resides in shades of black and white, nothing is provable to an accuracy of 100% .
9121	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	(that is not a straw man claim but it&#8217;s close due to Godel universes and the beautifully strange way the quantum world behaves due to uncertainty and non-locality etc.)
9122	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	You must know that if you earn a MA in theology you have more semester hours in philosophy than in nearly any other field.
9123	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	I have and I do.
9124	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	You should not make such claims in a public forum sassy.
9125	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Again not all things are black and white.
9126	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Personally I think you may should allow yourself to accept anything given freely without guilt and or anger.
9127	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	We agree again.
9128	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	If we could know 100% of the variables in the precise moment of calculation we could know everything about anything, and not even God can or chooses to know that about this universe.
9129	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	And without going off topic its that very concept that God chooses not to know or more likely can not know to an accuracy of 100% all the variables that constitutes the universe that gives our free will.
9130	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	You bring up some good points.
9131	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Personally, I believe the IRS and many taxes, including the income tax are illegal!
9132	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Adding another wrong to the bath water ie Obamas health care baby doll only reinforces bad behavior.
9133	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	So I say that yes, we should throw the dead baby doll out with the bath water!
9134	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Lastly I should say that having to pay taxes etc isn&#8217;t the same as being forced to buy a PRODUCT.
9135	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Other reasons come to mind not the least being that the health care thing may not stand up to constitutional muster!
9136	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Well you must understand that when I read her Bio I saw a woman more accomplished that most.
9137	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	She is much more accomplished than most of those that criticizes (I should say crucifies her).
9138	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Additionally, I highly admire her moral values ie her Christianity etc. Of course many people would write her off precisely because she is a Christian and is pro life.
9139	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2333	Most pro choice do not really understand or believe pro life people and that is a shame, but that in and of itself is another thread (abortion, morals etc) ra
9140	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	You certainly have some queer ideas about Christians Sassy!
9141	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Most Christians consider the lord grants our station in life.
9142	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Some don't thinking that God will provide only after death but that's not what scripture tells us.
9143	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I think that maybe you ought to brush up on the Christian faith if you plan to debate subjects that deal with theology, particularly Christianity.
9144	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Again, you are very wrong about that as well.
9145	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	There are more Christian support groups than secular groups, additionally the church would support her at least they would in most cases.
9146	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	My church is not a true church, as I do not preach except as in a guest capacity.
9147	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	However, the church of my youth has provided for many members that fell upon hard times, as the 'biker' church that I regularly attend.
9148	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Ummm' I goggled for Christian free services for mentally handicapped disabled children and received so many hits that I could not fit them on this page.
9149	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Therefore, I tried pasting them to a word processor document and received an error message saying the listings exceeded the capability of the WP!
9150	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I guess that rather shoots your claims down.Next I Goggled atheist organizations that offered free services for children etc etc. I could fit all of them on....ummm... on ...ahhh' a matchbook cover!
9151	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	You are assuming that the mother does not take the child!
9152	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Ha ha in fact you are so off base that I am beginning to wonder what your agenda is. The sad fact of the matter is that I think you really think those claims are true.
9153	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I am astonished that so much disinformation/propaganda exists.
9154	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Apparently, successful propaganda has convinced normally intelligent people like yourself that lies are truth.
9155	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I do.
9156	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Where have I been the first to come out of the blue and wrongly accuse you of anything?
9157	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	Well yes you are correct, I use the computer too much simply take my chances.
9158	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	So, we can agree on some items, which is a good indicator that we can discuss the issues without the argument or discussion becoming toxic.
9159	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	The biggest criticism I have of your replies is that you made quite a few non-sourced and unsubstantiated claims, many which were reworded are old atheist standbys or worse, however even the worst ones haven't damaged your credibility.
9160	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2334	I know that you have criticisms for me as well ! ra
9161	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	Right now the interest on our debt is at historically and ridiculously low levels.
9162	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	Lucky for us.
9163	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	Some EU countries that have gone beyond our own terrible debt levels are now paying OVER 11% on their debt.
9164	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	While 5% t0 8% would be a more normal interest rate for us to be paying, that is not the present case.
9165	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	But imagine if we were paying 7% on our debt.
9166	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	NOT an unusually high rate.7% X $14 TRILLION = $980,000,000,000.00.
9167	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	$980 billion dollars INTEREST.
9168	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	More than the Medicare/Medicaid total.
9169	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	More than the Social Security total.
9170	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	More than the Defense Dept. total.Even at our very low rate of interest, the interest amount is the single largest expense we have NOW!
9171	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	While M/M or SS or DD are higher totals, they are covering multiple agencies/depts.
9172	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	and multiple programs.
9173	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2335	Interest is a single line, and already the highest single line.
9174	Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2336	Well you will read a more detailed report, but basically it eliminates the avoidable taxes (well none should be avoidable, but...)The one tax they can't avoid is the Sales tax because they have to buy things.
9175	Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2336	I mean Wal-Mart would be one of the best examples of where they would HAVE to pay taxes.
9176	Hijothis	flounder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2336	The sales tax would be possibly shockingly high, around 30% if I'm not mistaken (gotta check that) and it would, in theory make up for the other lost taxes.Can't avoid a sales tax or else you have no food, clothes, technology, cosmetics, etc....
9177	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	If one pays taxes, one is deemed &quot;profitable,&quot; because they have income over expenses.
9178	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	&quot;Non-profit&quot; means exactly that, &quot;no income over expenses.&quot; If you do, you pay tax or get a &quot;tax credit&quot; that &quot;forgives&quot; the overage up to a certain amount.
9179	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I don't disagree with your posit.
9180	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	NO idea is concrete.
9181	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	And, that's the very foundation of philosophy.
9182	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	What seems to be, just may not be.
9183	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	That's also the foundation of scientific theory and why a theory must be replicated over and over before it is justified to be used as a matter of fact.
9184	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	Except that &quot;religion&quot; is the basis for the study.
9185	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	Why not?
9186	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	Not necessarily &quot;more capable&quot; just &quot;more aware&quot; of how hard it is to grow and bear a child and then lose the life of that child to something that is avoidable.
9187	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	Children are the first priority for most women.
9188	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I don't think a majority of men think that way, tho' I'm also sure some do.
9189	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I do not presume to know what god thinks, chooses to know or not know.
9190	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I do take for my personal philosophy the teachings found in the NT.
9191	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2337	I believe the inhumanity of humanity toward humanity is barbaric, founded in a perverted, distorted prime imperative &quot;to survive.&quot; Human beings have the intellectual ability to &quot;see&quot; beyond selfish, egocentric instincts and can reason together to a achieve a &quot;win-win&quot; goal for the public good.
9192	OneThunder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2340	True that.
9193	OneThunder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2340	Consumers tax.No taxes on anything else except consumer goods.Have you found any links to support the 30% figure.
9194	OneThunder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2340	I'd be interested in reading that.
9195	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	Imagine that all those programs that you pay taxes to support were to become voluntary.
9196	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	In other words, instead of sending money to the mongrels through threat of prosecution, you decide what programs that you want to support and how much money that you want to send to support them.
9197	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	The idea being that you are more careful spending your money than politicians are.
9198	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	The result would be next to no spending by the fed gov outside of defense and a real infusion of your cash locally.
9199	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	This is a very simplified version of what Ron Paul has been saying for thirty years.
9200	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	To learn a very detailed version, go to his website (there are many).
9201	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	Fair tax, consumer tax, etc. are all just different names for the same thing.
9202	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	The pols will not turn loose of the money if you don't make them.
9203	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	Check it out.
9204	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	You having control of all your income- what a novel idea.
9205	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	Crazy?
9206	driller80545	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2341	I would like to try it and see.
9207	Hijothis	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2343	Haven't had too much time.
9208	Hijothis	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2343	Will try by tomorrow.
9209	Jollee	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2344	No way!
9210	Jollee	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2344	still after two years and being an active Democrat, I will not vote for him!Jollee
9211	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2346	Interesting figures.
9212	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2346	Scary figures.
9213	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2346	What would happen if we (the USA) said 'no we will not pay our debt off?'
9214	RevAnarchist	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2346	And that 'and any attempt to collect payment will result in war!

9219	Dan40	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2350	Such a move would require that we immediately cut Federal and State spending by a few TRILLIONS of dollars since we would no longer be able to borrow any money at any rate.Might be worth a try!!!Also would result in recall or impeachment movements since the bulk of our debt is owed to US citizens.
9220	jthorp24	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2352	How about a billy club???

9222	Joey_Sac	driller80545	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2354	The first thing that would go unfunded would be the Department of Defense!
9223	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2355	Not that many are so stupid to think the world is filled with nice people.
9224	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2355	A 30 minute study of world history would tell you that the DoD is one of the most vital departments we have.
9225	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2355	Many cuts might need to be made, but the DoD is essential to our survival as a country and just as people.

9227	Hijothis	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2356	Even better!
9228	OneThunder	Hijothis	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2357	I'm exploring that website now.Enlightening reading so far.
9229	Hijothis	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2358	I have a shirt SIMILAR to that of your photo I.D. Mine says something about border control and is relevant to yours
9230	Hijothis	Albert Di Salvo	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2360	SHOULD not be is the key word.
9231	Hijothis	Albert Di Salvo	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2360	Will he NOT be?
9232	Hijothis	Albert Di Salvo	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2360	That's hard to discern at this point.
9233	driller80545	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2361	True, we must maintain the DoD to defend ourselves.
9234	driller80545	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2361	But what would be the difference in costs of defending the USA versus the American Empire.
9235	driller80545	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2361	The costs would be in international corporate profits ie haliburton!
9236	driller80545	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2361	lol
9237	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	I certainly hope that the American public will not be that incredibly stupid again.And the Republican candidate?
9238	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	This far in advance of the 2008 elections, the obamalama was NOT a Democratic possibility.There is still time for a candidate, not yet considered a possibility, to emerge.
9239	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	BHO did.
9240	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	And imagine the difference if the obamalama has to run against an actual STRONG candidate, that is neither old nor carrying Bush baggage.
9241	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	Whomever was the Democratic Candidate in 2008 was a walkover.
9242	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	BHO had to beat a woman, that's all.
9243	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	All the other Democrats shot themselves in the foot.
9244	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	And McCain was a sacrificial lamb.
9245	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	Now the obamalama will have to overcome his OWN failed policies and the most incredible debt ever run up by any president ever.

9247	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2363	And 2 years from now, his bullcrap of the last 2 years will be even more revealed than it is now.
9248	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2364	I find it funny how libs bash the Tea Party movement.
9249	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2364	Why?They stand for Constitutional government, and are against big, wasteful government.
9250	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2364	They are a Conservative movement.Everyone should be behind them.
9251	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2365	Some of us are against deficits and like the fact we don't have hordes of the aged, infirm and temporarily out of luck living under freeways begging at stoplights.
9252	Joey_Sac	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2366	I consider you one of the most informed people on the right so I will not insult your intelligence.
9253	Joey_Sac	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2366	The Tea Party has a good idea about getting government spending under control, (you know I am a Dem).
9254	Joey_Sac	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2366	But, like many I can not join any organization that has racist overtones.I do not believe all Tea Partiers are racist, but the accusation continues to be made, and the Tea Party has not rejected it with vigor.
9255	Joey_Sac	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2366	All it takes is one picture like this, and the Tea Party credibility is gone for a lot of people.So, for those like myself the Tea Party is a write-off.
9256	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2367	President Obama was elected by a maj...major....majori.
9257	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2367	He had the most votes!
9258	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2367	When you wish upon a star..........
9259	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2367	Dream on.
9260	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	Many things can kill a political party.
9261	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	And yes, the Democrats experienced a set back.
9262	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	Time will show that unloading the &quot;blue Dems&quot; was good because it is easier to target Republicans outside our party than it is to have internal struggle.Fact is the Republican Party does not even have a contender for President.
9263	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	Romney, Palin, Gingrich, Huckaby all favorites of the conservative Republican base.
9264	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2370	In the end the Republicans will be smart enough not to nominate any of them.If President Obama refused to run we have a plethoria of qualified candidates, Clinton, Biden, Reid, Pelosi, and my favorite new face, Anthony Weiner . Democrats have the end game.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Weinerhttp://www.weiner.house.gov/
9265	shaker154	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2371	Im not happy with any of those candidates... though from what ive heard of AW i might consider it...
9266	shaker154	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2371	BO will run again though...
9267	shaker154	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2371	I hope for a republican candidate who is at least a worthy challenger...
9268	shaker154	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2371	We shall see come Election 2012
9269	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2373	Quite frankly, I have seen nothing racist.
9270	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2373	The &quot;Don't tax me Bro&quot; was a take on the line the drunk dude said to a cop, &quot;Don't taze me Bro&quot;.The Tea Party-Racism link is non-existent, and has yet to be proven.
9271	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2373	There are wackos in every group, but they do not represent the group.
9272	onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2374	Are you for Constitutional government?
9273	onalandline	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2375	You crack me up.
9274	onalandline	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2375	What a flame-baiter!
9275	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	Liberal SOP, play the race card.The photo comes from not just a liberal site but a progressive site.
9276	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	A site that demeans the tea party in every way it can.
9277	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	And the photo is from 3/2010 OR earlier.
9278	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	The various tea party groups have denied racism and then the liberal media delights in calling them liars.However the tea party spoke loud enough for independents to hear in Nov. 2010.
9279	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	Liberals cannot hear as they are brainwashed into deafness and blindness.
9280	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	But the vast majority of the American public do not suffer from the liberal looniness.And where does the photo originate?
9281	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	AP, NY Times?
9282	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	FOX, CNN?
9283	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2376	No it originates with the progressive site its posted on.OTHER, supposedly, racist tea party photos have been shown to be STAGED
9284	onalandline	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2378	Even that one is based on the guy that said, &quot;Don't taze me Bro&quot;, to a white police officer.
9285	Jollee	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2379	You seem to be a bit sensitive....I have not seen racism with the Tea Party people, they seem like a good group of people to me, people who have taken undo criticism....It's actually sickening to see our Administration talk negative of them, it's disappointing...Jollee
9286	Jollee	j.r.TheWindbag1	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2381	He was lying way back when he was campaigning, wish people had listened to him more carefully....We would be in allot better shape now....
9287	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2383	Where were all you guys in 2001, or 2003, when the government was squandering the budget surplus and running up deficits with tax cuts?But I agree Obama has been not aggressive enough on this issue.
9288	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2383	With the country coming out of the recession, it was a mistake to cave to Republicans and let the Bush tax cuts run another two years, which will push back any meaningful progress on the deficits.
9289	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2383	Obama should also let the Bush tax cuts expire completely, and at a 5-10% surcharge on incomes over $1m to help redress the damage the Bush tax cuts have caused, as well as trim spending.
9290	Hijothis	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2384	Great bit of facts.
9291	Hijothis	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2384	Always wanted to know the details, but never looked them up...
9292	Hijothis	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2384	I would do one of those recommend credit things but I have no clue how...
9293	Hijothis	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2384	Anyone know how?
9294	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	Tell you what.
9295	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	You seem to be having a problem understanding what this thread is about, and my statements.
9296	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	So I'll dumb it down for you.
9297	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	The key word here is &quot;PERCEPTION.&quot; The Tea Party is &quot;PERCEIVED&quot; racist by many people who might otherwise be interested in what they have to say.
9298	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	You want to argue this picture or that picture.
9299	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	Well, Google &quot;Tea Party, Racist,&quot; you will find no less than 1,980,000 web sites that discuss the problem!
9300	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	Most would agree that that many web sites on the subject indicates a problem.
9301	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	Here is a link.
9302	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&amp;h...83dfe782e20cdc Now are you ready to discuss the obvious problem or racism in the Tea Party, or are you going to continue to ignore the reality?Tea Party leader, Dale Robertson http://www.mediaite.com/online/tea-p...r-n-word-sign/http://www.youtube.com/TheGRAMMYs?feature=tickerIt is really easy to go with Bill Maher on this issue.
9303	Joey_Sac	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2385	The Tea Party has a public relations night mare, and it will bring them down as racist.
9304	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	And now I'll dumb it down for you.
9305	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	Liberals PERCIEVE everyone that does not kowtow to the liberal line as RACIST.
9306	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	Liberals also believe that the American public is stupid and believes the lies liberals tell.
9307	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	And the left constantly insults the American public.
9308	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	I'm amazed that liberals do not realize that the constant barrage of, &quot;You don't understand.&quot; and, &quot;I didn't explain it well enough.&quot; ARE insults to the public's intelligence.
9309	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	And the public DOES understand and liberals explained their position to boredom.
9310	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	We know what you're saying and we don't like it and we disagree.What the tea party is is the famous &quot;Silent Majority&quot; no longer being silent.
9311	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	The tea party got a lot of people elected in November and WILL get more people elected in 2012.
9312	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	Democrats WILL lose control of all of Congress in 2012.
9313	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	And the obamalama's phony move to the center will not hold up to scrutiny for 2 years.The reality is that the tea party is effective and liberals are trying everything they can to smear it.
9314	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	That's the reality.Another reality is that 99% of our news media is liberal leftist and they print and broadcast nothing but slurs and claims of racism by the tea party.
9315	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	All of that ends up on line so it is no surprise that the same junk is repeated 2 million times.
9316	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	But a couple of unsubstantiated stories repeated 2 million times is NOT 2 million examples.
9317	Dan40	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2387	Its just a couple of liberal lies repeated ad nauseum.
9318	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2389	Bill Maher is a misinformed moron.The Tea Party movement is not racist.
9319	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2389	There are folks from all walks of life in the movement.
9320	onalandline	Joey_Sac	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2389	More folks should be, but I guess liberals like living in a bloated, bureaucratic pipe dream.Racism is always used by liberals when there really is no argument.
9321	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2391	That is an assinine statement.
9322	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2391	Show me one post of my where I've called someone a RACIST for not kowtowing to the liberal line.I'll dumb it down for you.
9323	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2391	Your entire arguments are based on a strawman.
9324	Hijothis	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2392	Best quote I have heard in a long time.

9331	shaker154	j.r.TheWindbag1	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2395	Being relatively close to the middle myself and going to rallies for both parties (obviously separate elections) i can see their view point..
9332	shaker154	j.r.TheWindbag1	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2395	Both sides are too far apart and there is no &quot;middle&quot; candidate so we are forced to choose between a (south park reference) turd sandwich or a (*)(*)(*)(*)(*)(*)..

9338	jthorp24	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2402	They can't tell who you voted for.
9339	jthorp24	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2402	So you can add another vote to the no column...
9340	LittleLiberty	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2403	Why would I vote no?
9341	jthorp24	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2404	Why would you vote yes?
9342	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	Volumes of reasons.
9343	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	Here is a few.A housing bubble where billions of dollars were thrown at the problem, unresolved.A financial crisis, same process and results as above.An economy that also had over a trillion dollars thrown at it.
9344	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	The economy improves very slowly without a shred of positive proof that the trillion plus dollars poured in have anything to do with the recovery.

9346	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	We are now in the &quot;eventually&quot; stage.Unemployment at or over 9% for longer than ANY other president in the entire history of the country, WHILE spending more money than any other president in the entire history of the country.National debt at the end of Clinton's last full fiscal year, $5.674 trillion.National debt at the end of Bush's EIGHT YEARS IN OFFICE, $10.024 trillion.
9347	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	A TERRIBLE increase of $4.35 trillion.Total accumulated national debt from George Washington through George W. Bush's last full fiscal year.
9348	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	$10.024 trillion.Total accumulated national debt now after just over TWO YEARS OF the obamalama, $ 14.168 trillion.
9349	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	An incredible, insane increase of $ 4.144 trillion in just over TWO YEARS.
9350	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2405	A &quot;mere&quot; $206 billion more added to the debt and the obamalama will surpass Bush's terrible 8 years of spending in WELL UNDER 3 years.That's why to say NO to the idiot incompetent obamalama.He makes Carter, Nixon, and Bush look good by comparison and they all STUNK.
9351	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	There's lots of evidence it worked great.
9352	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	The economy stopped tanking at -7% real and is growing for that last year.
9353	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	The economy stopped losing 700,000 jobs a month and the private sector has created jobs every month for the last year.
9354	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	The stock market stopped tanking and is up about 90%.
9355	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	Even unemployment, always a lagging indicator, is improving.Only those invested in failure for political purposes could possibly say that there is no evidence government intervention worked.
9356	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2406	Without it in all likelihood we'd be in the third year of a depression.
9357	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	To quote:&quot;Without it in all likelihood&quot;Was that Freudian or an admission that you don't know?A FACT that both you and I can see is that after blowing TRILLIONS, the economy is still flat.The unemployment is still high.The banks are not lending.Housing foreclosures are still terrible.Is it better for blowing trillions of dollars or worse for doing so.Would it be better had we not blown trillions that we do not have or would it be worse.Neither you nor I can provide factual proof one way or another.Our only example of such reckless spending and massive Government intervention is FDR back in the Depression.
9358	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	It took 15 years and a World War to pull us out of that.
9359	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	Was the Depression that bad, or did Government intrusion cause it to last so long?And the obamalama's recession compares with Reagan's, not with the Depression.
9360	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	Neither Reagan's nor BHO's recession's were their fault so I'm not blaming him for the recession, just the gross mismanagement of it.What we FACTUALLY have as evidence is that we are $ 4,144,000,000,000.00 further in debt than we were.
9361	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	And housing, finance, and unemployment still awful.
9362	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	Remember, last summer was TO BE, &quot;The Summer of Recovery,&quot; according to Biden.
9363	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2407	WHAT recovery?
9364	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Just look at who is &quot;presenting opinions as facts.&quot; Kessy_Athena: Don't ever apologize to DanNO40 because he hasn't the manners or the common sense to understand that discussion/debate can ever &quot;trump&quot; his &quot;opinions,&quot; even when you quote unimpeachable, unbiased sources.
9365	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	I know.
9366	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	I've tried.
9367	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	He's too old, too retired and too set in his ways to ever be open minded again.
9368	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Yeah, and for the most part they were ALLLLLLLL Republicans who had 6 years to deal with the problems and decided it was more important to start 2 wars and annihilate the treasury because they wanted to monopolize the oil in the ME for their rich, NeoCon cronies.HOW VERY QUICK CONSERVATIVES ARE TO FORGET!
9369	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	They just LOVE to change history!!!!!!!!!They gave humongous tax breaks to the rich and most humongous corporations paid/pay NO TAX AT ALL!
9370	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Examples: GE, Bank of America, BP et.al. The oil producers still get subsidies in spite of polluting the Gulf of Mexico where oil still lies 4 inches deep on the floor of the gulf.
9371	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	None of it on the floor has been &quot;eaten&quot; by bacteria as promised and as far as anyone of us knows, the bottom of the Gulf is DEAD!
9372	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	SO!!
9373	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Why are you still a conservative?
9374	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Bratboy Bush allowed his Wall Street buddies to do their dirty deals and then handed it over to Obama, who now must &quot;deal&quot; with the white collar multibillionaires who took the middle class to the cleaners by trashing their pension funds with bogus &quot;synthetic&quot; securities.
9375	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Just like the &quot;richies&quot; who invested with Bernie Madoff, the pension funds got greedy and Bush's SEC cronies fired Brookslie Born for blowing the whistle on them.
9376	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Why not?
9377	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	She's just a stupid woman isn't she?
9378	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	And, everybody knows women have no sense for figures except for those she was born with.
9379	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	Once again, I agree with you.
9380	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	When you quote figures from the CBO (tho' estimated), I take heed.
9381	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	However, you conservatives only take heed when the CBO gives you something you agree with.
9382	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2409	But, you're the first to blow &quot;sour&quot; when you don't agree with them.But, then, conservatives are just like Moby Dick, you &quot;blow&quot; hard against hard facts when the wind isn't to your liking!!!
9383	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Thank you for the unrelenting personal attack.
9384	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	The sad FACT, not opinion, is that your attack is nearly devoid of any FACTS.
9385	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	But loaded with liberal brainwashed opinions.A for instance: The Republicans under Bush, you CANNOT find a post with me defending them.
9386	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	However just as the obamalama did not cause the recession, NEITHER did Bush.The financial and housing crises were caused almost equally by politicians of both parties.
9387	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Passing some bills that caused the housing bubble and repealing some laws that would have prevented the insane financial manipulations that went on.
9388	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	All of your so called synthetic securities can be laid at the feet of politicians of both parties long before Bush got to DC.
9389	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	And there is ample evidence that Bush warned about it and made attempts to correct it.
9390	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	But entrenched politicians, D &amp; R, would not allow it.So your misguided and historically inaccurate attempt to lay it all off on johnny come lately Republicans is just repeating lies that liberals have taught you to tell.
9391	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	The problems were festering before you became aware of politics at all, other than perhaps a subject in a high school curriculum.Republicans are NOT innocent in the causes of today's problems and neither are the Democrats.
9392	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	So I do not fault obama for our present crisis, but I fault him for the outrageously expensive and inept way he has &quot;attempted&quot; to fix the problem.Maybe you forget?
9393	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	What he did was get the Stimulus bill passed.
9394	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Which was SUPPOSED to be for &quot;shovel ready&quot; projects, but we now know it was a state bailout bill.
9395	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Political payback, nothing more, but to the tune of a TRILLION dollars.
9396	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Once he had 'shoveled' the Stimulus on us, he then IGNORED the economy entirely for going on TWO YEARS, while he exhausted ALL his political capital on passing obamalamacare.
9397	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	And with total control of both houses of Congress he had to stoop to bribes, lies, and coercion of his own party to get it passed.
9398	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Meanwhile if the bad economy or unemployment was mentioned, he was ready to write a check.
9399	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	NOTHING else, just throw more money at the problem until its so buried in money no one can see it anymore.
9400	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	National debt, UP $4.144 trillion since Bush's last budget, how much good is that doing for the nation?
9401	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Bush increased the debt $4.350 trillion in 8 years and you and all liberals SCREAM the horror of bush over that.
9402	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Yet don't even mutter about $4.144 trillion in just over 24 MONTHS.Your credibility with me is $4.144 trillion in arrears.BP and the oil spill?
9403	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Now that is Bush's fault too?
9404	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Utter, total nonsense.
9405	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	It happened on the incompetent obamalama's watch and IF 4 feet of oil [doubtful] is lying on the floor of the Gulf, it is the obamalama's job to see its cleaned up, not Bush.Oil subsidies?
9406	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Do you know what they are?
9407	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	They are oil depletion allowances because every barrel they pump out of the ground brings the oil company a barrel closer to going out of business.
9408	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Ridiculous?
9409	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Probably so, but they were not invented by Bush.
9410	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	They were around when he was a drunken college kid and before.
9411	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Probably in effect when his Dad was a kid.
9412	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Before the tax changes in tax law in the 80's I was invested in oil.
9413	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	There were excellent LEGAL, tax CREDITS available for owning oil.
9414	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	They took those away and I and 10's of thousands of others, liberal and conservative, got out of oil.Do I defend my opinions?
9415	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	YES.
9416	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Opinions found by experience greater than yours over decades.
9417	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	[What you snidely think of as old age] Even as a school age youngster I received a better more balanced education than you poor kids do now with the shambles our schools have become.
9418	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	I have risked my life 100% for this country, knowingly put my life on the line.
9419	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	And I have willingly risked my life savings, every cent I had.
9420	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	You have done neither.
9421	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	That does not make me a good person and you not, you could well be a much better person than me. But those all-in risks are educational.
9422	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	Educational about every aspect of life.Do I call my opinions facts?
9423	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	No, I do not.
9424	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2410	I usually say something is a fact when it is. I don't often point out that I'm voicing an opinion, but if someone has to be told that, they wouldn't understand the disclaimer anyway.
9425	onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2412	To stop the downward spiral this country is currently engaged in.
9426	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	And, what do you call this post of yours, Kudos for me?
9427	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	You can't defend Bratboy because he was the most inept President this country has seen in 50 years.
9428	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Reagan was an idiot, but even he raised taxes when he saw the country going to hell in a hand basket.
9429	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	And, to proclaim that Bush is not responsible for the humongous debt the country has now is trying to swim in now is simply economic blasphemy.
9430	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Not so!!!!
9431	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Read my post again.
9432	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	But, you won't.
9433	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	On the other hand, I can't see that the Tea-baggers have a leg to stand on for their ridiculous and unrealistic demands.
9434	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	&quot;Bone-head&quot; Boehner, in spite of his years in the House, can't get the procedure rules in the House correct in order to forward his agenda.
9435	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Bottom line, he is a bogus excuse for a Speaker: He's &quot;Blubbering Bubba&quot; at the drop of a hint of how he &quot;suffered&quot; to get to where he is today.
9436	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	You being a former military man, you must cringe at the very sight of his shameful visage of emotional drainage.
9437	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	How far our political leaders have deteriorated since Viet Nam!
9438	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	The only President in recent history to serve in combat was GHWB at age 19.
9439	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Others wore the uniform but did not serve in combat.

9441	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Yeah, he's expected to fix in a bit over 2 years the inept governance that took Bratboy and the NeoCons 8 years to mess up with lies and idiotic decisions.
9442	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Even Rummy the Dummy, in his new book, has 'fessed up to the disaster they inflicted on we the people!
9443	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Just your opinion and others like you try to make that claim stick, but even if true, he helped the states out of a bind.
9444	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Ummmm, now who is making facts from opinion?
9445	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Can't you get anything &quot;right?
9446	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	I posted 4&quot; (that's 4 inches) of oil on the floor of the gulf.
9447	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	That's the report from this source: Gulf of Mexico bottom still coated in oil, recovery long way off
9448	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Is this also a &quot;brag&quot; that you got your money out?
9449	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	What has that got to do with the government continuing to pay corporate welfare to oil companies who are making astronomical profits, profits higher that at any other time in history, while Republicans stridently scream about cutting education, Medicare/Medicaid, Social Security, etc. What have conservatives got against the young and the old in this country?
9450	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Why do oil companies rate higher on the scale of human need than human beings?
9451	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	Again you presume info about me that you don't &quot;factually&quot; have access to.
9452	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	You know little to nothing about me, my education, my age, etc. I venture to suggest that any apolitical reader on this forum who compares my posts to yours would come away with a very different assessment of my education vs. yours, my ability to reason vs. yours, my foundation of &quot;real&quot; facts vs. your opinionated based &quot;facts.&quot;
9453	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2413	That statement is a &quot;Hoot!&quot;
9454	LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2414	Wow, you just noticed that when Obama became Prez?
9455	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2416	Check back with me when you learn to find the truth on your own and stop acting like a high school dummy.
9456	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2416	Right now you do not have a clue of what has really happened over the last 50 or 60 years.
9457	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2416	All of which are pertinent to today's situation.
9458	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2416	What you dismiss as &quot;old&quot; is knowledge gained.
9459	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2416	Something that hasn't happened for you yet.
9460	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2416	The way you keep your mind locked shut, it may never happen for you.

9468	LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2420	And of course George W. Bush did none of that.
9469	LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2420	He's a savior.

9471	LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2420	He put this country out of jeapordy with his tax cuts for the rich, war that killed thousands of innocent people, and knee jerk response to the worst terrorist attack in history.
9472	LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2420	McCain would have continued such heroic acts for the country, with his Godsent angel Sarah Palin (anyone that didn't vote for her is SEXIST!)
9473	LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2420	but people were STUPID and NAIVE enough to vote for the Kenyan-born OBAMA, just because he's BLACK.

9486	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	How does George Bush being a bad president make the incompetent obamalama a good president?One has nothing to do with the other.The only way they COULD be connected is that if Bush had been a good president, then obama would not have been elected.
9487	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	Another Republican, any Republican would have been.
9488	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	If Bush had been good, the Republicans would not have offered up the sacrificial lamb, McCain.
9489	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	They would have run someone else.
9490	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	But Bush was bad, thus opening the door for an inexperienced far left radical idiot to become president.So we went from doofus, to radical idiot.
9491	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	That is NOT progress.The doofus added $4.350 trillion to the national debt in 8 years and the incompetent radical idiot WILL surpass that amount when this fiscal year ends 09/30/2011.&quot;Bush caused the recession!&quot; That is just a statement made out of ignorance of facts and history.
9492	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	He did not cause it but he was one of a decades long line of contributors to the eventual collapse of the economy.obama didn't cause the recession either.
9493	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	But he did TOTALLY ignore the economy for well over a year attempting &quot;by any means necessary&quot; to get his health care bill passed.
9494	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	Yet the health care bill doesn't really start kicking in until 2014.
9495	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	The economy was more important and SHOULD have been his priority, NOT some dream way down the road.
9496	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	But in retrospect, its a good thing he ignored the economy, he would have made it even worse with his borrow and spend our way out of debt approach.Bush spending was terrible, obama is worse.Bush used the Patriot Act, obama kept the patriot act for his own use.Bush was vilified for the war and the 'surge.' obama has kept the war going and did his own &quot;surge.&quot;Bush was bad because of 'Gitmo.' obama hasn't closed Gimot like he PROMISED he would, in fact, he is quite happy to use it.Bush was a killer for using attack drones.
9497	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	obama uses many TIMES more death drones than Bush did.So YES!
9498	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	Bush was bad.
9499	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2421	How does that make obama good?
9500	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	And if there were no mess, obama wouldn't be president.
9501	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	I did say that was the only connection.Regardless bush was bad.
9502	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	That does not make obama good.
9503	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	He's much worse.
9504	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	You don't want to believe that but history will list him as the worst president in modern times, maybe ever.No one can say this nation is not in deep financial trouble.
9505	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	No matter if you love or hate obama, we are in trouble.
9506	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	And it doesn't matter who you want to blame, the problem STILL has to be fixed.
9507	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	Blaming is a gross waste of time.So what does the incompetent clown obamalama do about our serious financial problems?
9508	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2423	In his accomplished oratory, he eliminates the word spend, and replaces it with, &quot;invest.&quot; Once again insulting the American public with his unbridled arrogance and conceit.
9509	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2424	Wow, pay attention to the entire sarcastic post.
9510	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2424	Everyone always seems to blame Obama for every single problem in this country.
9511	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2424	Most problems were there in the Bush and even Clinton years, yet no one blamed them for the problems.
9512	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2424	Now that we have a black person as President, suddenly all the right-wings are noticing &quot;hey, something's wrong with this country.
9513	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2424	OBAMA DID IT!&quot; and that's all they've been saying since Obama was sworn in.

9521	onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2425	We certainly did not.
9522	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2426	To the contrary.
9523	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2426	The economy was tanking at -7% real and losing 700,000 jobs a month and the stock market was tanking and the unemployment rate was skyrocketing before the stimulus passed.
9524	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2426	Not the economy has been growing for a year and a half, jobs are being created, the stock market is up about 85%, and the unemployment rate is declining.Bi-partisan organizations like the CBO estimate the stimulus saved or created up to over $3 million jobs and decreased the unemployment rate by 1.8 percentage points.
9525	onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2427	You have just ranted for an entire large paragraph about things that I never mentioned.

9534	LittleLiberty	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2429	Because while Bush was president, you wanted to keep living in your fairytale world and believe nothing was wrong with the country, just because a white Republican was in office.

9542	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	Bush ran up huge deficits and added $4.350 trillion to the national debt.
9543	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	And the liberal press crucified him for it.
9544	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	And so did FOX!
9545	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	$ 4.350 trillion over 8 years is just over half a trillion per year.
9546	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2432	AND THAT IS TERRIBLE.Yet somehow the liberal press thinks that even though obama has run deficits surpassing Bush's deficits and obama is increasing the national debt more than $2 trillion PER YEAR, that is OK because he's black, or for change, or is good because Bush was bad.I'll say it slow for you.BUSH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bad,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,obama ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,worse.
9547	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2433	I'll say it slow for you.The......problems.......with....this......country.
9548	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2433	....are......not......Obama's.......fault.
9549	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	Perhaps English is not your native language.
9550	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	I clearly said that obama was not at fault for the recession.
9551	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	However he IS at fault for the incredible, unending, list of mistakes he has made.
9552	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	He did not cause the problem as Bush did not cause the problem either.
9553	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	But Bush made it worse and the incompetent idiot obamalama has trumped Bush and made a bad situation even worse.Just the money alone.Bush's spending,The liberal media screamed about Bush's spending.FOX screamed about his spending.I screamed about his spending.Did YOU?Now I scream about obama's spending.FOX screams about obama's spending.The liberal media doesn't scream about his spending.Do YOU?Yet by 09/30/2011, 7 months from now, obamalama will have increased the national debt by more actual dollars than Bush did in 8 years.But I'm sure you'll pee in your diapers and say &quot;He had to spend like an insane idiot.&quot; Well every reckless spending politician says that.
9554	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	And for obamalama and every other politician its pure unadulterated bullsh!t.That is just one thing, but its the one thing that can ruin the nation.
9555	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	There is a laundry list of (*)(*)(*)(*) ups the clown has done.How about the cop and the prof in Mass. RACISM on the president's part.The woman from the Dept of Agriculture.
9556	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	He had her fired before knowing a fact.
9557	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	Reverse racism on the presidents part.
9558	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	Then had MSNBC and the NY Times try to blame it on FOX.How about ignoring the Constitution AND long standing bankruptcy laws and cheating the rightful creditors and giving GM away to the UAW.Or current events, sticking his uninformed and biased nose into the affairs of WI, after being afraid to say anything to Egypt AND IRAN.Or the Iranian warships now in the Mediterranean.
9559	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	You can hate Bush but Iran knew if they tried that under Bush, their warships would soon be artificial reefs.
9560	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2434	But because obama is a weakling, they thumbed their nose at the USA.And that's not a 10th of his screw ups.He is an empty suit filled with clever recordings, but that's evidently enough to fool you.
9561	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2435	Obama is not the anti-Christ.
9562	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2435	Bush is not God.
9563	LittleLiberty	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2435	Open your eyes for the first time, my baby, and see the world.
9564	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	I cannot have a debate with a foolish no nothing child that is indoctrinated into liberal lies.But FOX did scream about Bush's spending.
9565	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	You were being potty trained and missed it.I screamed about Bush's spending, then and now.
9566	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	Evidently you cannot read well enough see the now part and you don't know anything about the then part.
9567	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	See little girl, I retired about the same time Bush became president, but you feel free to call me a liar.
9568	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	{Mod Edit: Personal insults are against the TOS}.Never have you seen me even hint any connection between the incompetent fool [no wonder you like him] obama and Hitler.Palin was the throwaway sacrificial lamb to fill out the Republican ticket that they knew they were going to lose.
9569	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	They just thought they were going to lose to Hillary, not the clown prince of nothing.All Palin is and continues to be is a distraction.
9570	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	Her celebrity is 100% the fault of the left wing press.
9571	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	Had they ignored her she would be a footnote in history now.The spending?Google or Bing the official US Treasury total of the National debt.
9572	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	At the end of Bush's last fiscal year it was $10.024 trillion, an increase of $4.350 trillion over Clinton..
9573	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	At the end of Clinton's last fiscal year the debt was $5.674 trillion.
9574	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	You could look it up instead of immaturely calling anyone a liar when YOU are 100% wrong.
9575	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	And as of TODAY the national debt is at $14.175 trillion.
9576	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	In case you are remedial at math and reading, that is an increase of $4.151 trillion.
9577	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	So only $199 Billion more and he passes Bush's total.
9578	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	And only $849 billion to pass the $5 trillion mark, this year.
9579	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	And that is 7 months from now[US fiscal year ends 09/30 each year].
9580	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	He is a lock to pass Bush, the only question is how far past the $5 trillion mark he will push the national debt THIS YEAR.You might also check the Congressional Budget Office [CBO] official estimate of the projected debt from obama's spending.
9581	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	Its a shocking number, and that's the CBO.
9582	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	They are they official estimators for the Government.
9583	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	They are the same ones that said obamalamacare would be deficit neutral and even might save about $200 billion.
9584	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	They've since backed away from that nonsense.It took the crazy, wasteful, reckless spending Bush 8 years to increase the debt that much.
9585	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	The clown obama is spending at a rate much more than twice Bush's.And if you claim that is not true.
9586	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2436	{Mod Edit: Personal insults are against the TOS}.
9587	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	Well, I have a &quot;bit of sense&quot; and a blue ribbon education to boot and what you imply borders on stuff espoused by conspiracy theorists like the John Birch Society.
9588	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	These people hate everybody; and according to them, anyone who disagrees with them are &quot;brainwashed liberals.&quot; Well, investigate their rhetoric and one soon discovers that just about every word they utter is without foundation -- past and present.
9589	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	I've been invited to their meetings and went.
9590	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	They appeal to everyone who has a grudge and it's always the &quot;liberals&quot; who are to blame -- you name it, they're responsible.
9591	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	At one time, it was the &quot;commies&quot; and &quot;fellow-travellers,&quot; now it's &quot;liberals.&quot;
9592	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	Young people are liberal because they react to the overt and covert unfairness and injustice they see in their country, coming from the so-called &quot;adults.&quot; This includes often ideas and behavior they observe coming from their own parents.
9593	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	They are brainwashed by ALL media (from kindergarden to high school and beyond) that the USA is the greatest country in the world because citizens are &quot;free&quot; to think, feel, see opportunity and be successful just by following &quot;the rules,&quot; and by working hard.
9594	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	Well, NONE of that is true.
9595	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	It's a fairy tale, just like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny.
9596	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	By age 11 or 12, most kids see the hypocrisy.
9597	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	What they do then is try to affect some change to reflect the &quot;dream&quot; to help make the dream come true.
9598	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	(That's what is going on in the ME right now!)What the hell does this statement mean?
9599	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	It doesn't make any sense!
9600	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	No one who has seen photos of the holocaust could make this statement.
9601	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	It's so totally &quot;off line.&quot; Your forum name is certainly apropos because only an &quot;anarchist&quot; (meaning &quot;outlaw&quot;) could stomach that kind of political .
9602	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	This statement describes Bratboy Bush to the &quot;Tea&quot; party, more than to Obama.
9603	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	How could Obama with just a bit over 2 years in office have made a record like the one you opine?
9604	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	As for your &quot;boy&quot; Terry Lakin, I suggest his web site is more a strong plea for contributions than for &quot;truth.&quot;
9605	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	Every source you post here is, without question, HARD HARD RIGHT WING NUTS!
9606	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	No one with even an ounce of &quot;common sense&quot; would accept this &quot;Junk&quot; rhetoric as anything more than &quot;Junk&quot; food fried up for mentally challenged ideologues.
9607	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2438	You have some nerve complaining about Obama when you offer up this cholesterol jammed greasy snake oil to anyone!
9608	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	If anyone is an &quot;ass&quot; here, it is the one who can't handle the truth!
9609	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	And, you, DanNO have a struggle with the simple truth that others point out to you.
9610	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Interesting.
9611	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	She's referred to herself as a &quot;Mama Grizzly&quot; and a pit bull wearing lipstick, but &quot;sacrificial lamb&quot; is not in her vocabulary.
9612	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Agreed!
9613	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	ooooooooooooo.
9614	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Naughty, naughty.
9615	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Must'nt call people names because it isn't polite on this forum.
9616	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Tho' I know of one that allows such things and even more &quot;dirty&quot; words than you can think to spout.Look, DanNO40, I can agree with you about the spending.
9617	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I have been called &quot;cheap&quot; for my adherence to fiscal responsibility.
9618	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I say I am &quot;frugal&quot; and let it go at that.
9619	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I consider myself a very responsible &quot;saver&quot; and &quot;investor&quot; (For example, I bought Apple when it was $14 a share.
9620	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I pat myself on the back every day for that bit of insight.)
9621	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I am NOT an economist.
9622	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Most economists I have had experience with are &quot;air&quot; heads, meaning they are all theory and not realists.
9623	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	So much for the likes of Bernanke, Greenspan, Volker et.al.
9624	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	(Tho' I was gratified that Greenspan finally 'fessed up about his idol Libertarian, Ayn Rand, had got it wrong).
9625	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	But, I also think that success in business does not guarantee that that person is qualified to govern a country.
9626	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Too very different jobs.
9627	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	A CEO's only job is to make a good profit.
9628	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	A President or other leader of a country must provide for &quot;the people's best interest, way of life and protection of life.&quot; Very different obligations.
9629	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	IOW, A CEO's first obligation is to make money for the shareholders.
9630	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	A President's first obligation is to promote the people's welfare from birth to death.
9631	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I think Obama has tried to do that.
9632	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Further, I don't expect him to be &quot;perfect&quot; particularly in the light of his predecessor's inept performance.
9633	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I've said before that I am an Independent -- and I am.
9634	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I happen to know and respect one very able and competent Republican Senator, Richard Lugar.
9635	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I also know and respect another very able and competent long time Democratic Senator, Carl Levin.
9636	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	Both, are brilliant and above all, politically reasonable and responsible.
9637	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	My personal recollection of these two well behaved politicians is that they are rubbing their collective heads in dismay at what is going on in Washington today.
9638	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	I feel bad for what they must cope with in today's political climate.
9639	Sassy	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2439	As David Letterman would say, &quot;I wouldn't wish that on a monkey sittin' on a rock.&quot;
9640	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Your words about economists are the most reasonably intelligent posts you have made.
9641	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	There are a couple of know nothing clowns on another thread that tried to say that I didn't know anything about business because I wouldn't hire an economists.
9642	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Even after I pointed out to them that economists make up less than 3/10thoudandths of the private sector workforce.I disagree that the president's job is to promote the people's general welfare from birth to death.
9643	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	His job is to take care of the nation so that people can promote their own welfare.
9644	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	You may think that is the same thing, I believe otherwise.Providing an atmosphere where both large and small, union and non-union companies could hire again would allow PEOPLE to provide for themselves.
9645	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Instead he has pursued a leftist agenda, providing actual welfare rather than promoting anything but his own agenda.And the spending, that he shows no sign of even truly acknowledging, is a knife in the heart of the nation.And his predecessors ineptness, is a given.
9646	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Now how does that make obamalama anything more or less than he is?Bush was inept, obamalama is more so.
9647	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I'd greatly prefer that was not the case.
9648	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I'd prefer that we had a capable Chief Executive, but having been a CEO and having interviewed and hired executives.
9649	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I would not hire BHO for anything above middle level sales.
9650	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	And I'd have his immediate supervisor watch him very closely since I never allowed any salesman to sell on anything but quality and service.
9651	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	And I'd be very wary of him overselling with loads of BS.And what Letterman says is unimportant.
9652	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I don't know why he sold out his talent to the liberal left, but he did.Ayn Rand was a Russian.
9653	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	Most likely had experiences that neither her fans nor her distractors ever will have.
9654	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	She was an excellent author.
9655	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	I've enjoyed many if not all of her books.
9656	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	They are fiction.
9657	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2440	No different than the movies, make believe.
9658	Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	All of your credit just went out the window.
9659	Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	ALL of it.
9660	Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	Do you even understand the things Regan did for this country?
9661	Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	Of course you don't.
9662	Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	In fact, you probably weren't even alive during his presidency.
9663	Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	Please refrain from polluting this beautiful blog network with completely inane claims such as this.
9664	Hijothis	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2441	Please.
9665	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Don't try to blame me for your posts!
9666	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	There is your inexperience and naivety showing through.
9667	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Can you say Carter or Nixon?
9668	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	And there is that reading challenge rearing its ugly head.
9669	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	I CLEARLY said Bush increased the debt by $4.350 trillion in 8 years, and that to do so was terrible.
9670	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	But you want to make excuses for the obamalama increasing the debt by $4.151 trillion in just over 1/4th of that time.
9671	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Where is the logic or intelligence in that?
9672	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	The obamalama will surpass Bush's awful spending in just a few WEEKS, and he will have increased the debt by more than $5 trillion by the end of this fiscal year 9/30/2011.
9673	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Fail.
9674	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	I mention my service only as an example of one of many learning EXPERIENCES you have not had and cannot imagine.
9675	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Many of which help develop a very accurate bullsh!t detector, which the incompetent clown obamalama sets off on an ongoing basis.
9676	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Show me where I said BHO is bad for not fixing the economy in the time he's had.
9677	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	My complaint is that his singular approach, pour money over it, has not worked and that he spent more than half his presidency ramrodding a bad bill that even his own party had to be bribed and threatened to pass.
9678	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	There was and is a crushing priority in the country and it is NOT health care.
9679	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	But he had to ignore the economy while he had the control of both Houses of Congress.
9680	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Understandable, but a complete failure of judgment.
9681	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Even the obamalama hisownself has admitted that &quot;shovel ready&quot; projects were a myth.
9682	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	That's not good enough for you?
9683	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	When the POTUS admits it, I'm still voicing an opinion?
9684	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	That's amazing.Plus, he had NO business bailing out any state without the consent of the American people.
9685	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	But he did bail out states, Democrat states primarily, with a &quot;bait and switch&quot; Stimulus bill.
9686	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	It WAS supposed to create jobs.
9687	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Covering a states past due bad debts is not creating jobs.And I guess we are even, you don't 'remember' that Nixon was a bad president.
9688	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	And I don't remember that Kissinger was ever president.
9689	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	A horse and a horse.
9690	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Your &quot;source is &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot;
9691	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	And you would lose that venture.
9692	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	Your posts reveal all about you.
9693	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	You are a closed minded ideologue that isn't ever aware that you are a far left liberal.
9694	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	You choose to ignore facts when you find them inconvenient, and little or nothing you say is from your own intellect.Now if you wish to claim that I am also a closed minded ideologue, I will admit that has some merit.
9695	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	But at one time I was a member of a union, more than one, and a registered Democrat.
9696	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	I gave that up long before FOX went on the air.
9697	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2443	I gave up on liberals and Democrats after observing what they do and the results of what they do.
9698	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	Palin is an ass who's celebrity is totally the fault of the left wing media attempting to outdo each other by mocking her.
9699	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	Had the leftist media just ignored her after the election, she'd be a footnote now.But what does Palin being a genius or a dolt have to do with obama?
9700	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	If Palin was terrific, that wouldn't make obamalama bad.
9701	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	He does that to himself.
9702	Dan40	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2444	And Palin being an ass doesn't make the clown obamalama good either.One has nothing to do with the other.Its liberal loony-ism to attach any cause and effect to any connection between them
9703	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2445	Sorry I neglected to add this in my earlier post.These numbers are NOT my opinion.
9704	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2445	However we can safely say that statements like: &quot; oil companies who are making astronomical profits, profits higher that at any other time in history, &quot; are strictly your opinion.The gross incompetent clown's 2 big &quot;Industries of Evil.&quot;OIL Industry, NET profit margin 11.8%HEALTH CARE PLANS, Net profit margin 3.3%Net profit margins of some other industries, not part of the &quot;Industries of Evil.&quot;Beverages, Brewers-18%Industrial metals--17.9%Drug Mfgs.
9705	Dan40	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2445	--16.9%Cigarettes---------15.8%Agricultural Chem.-15.2%Info&amp;delivery Ser.-13%Education &amp; train.-11.5%Wireless Comm.-----10.8%Gen. Entertainment-8.6%Soft Drinks--------6.7%Auto Parts Stores--6%Recreational Vech-5.1%But according the the clown prince, OIL at 11.8% and health insurance at 3.3% are the villains!When in reality, they are just easy targets for him to lie about to the ignorant.
9706	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2449	Yes the race will be close because he is superb at campaigning to be president.
9707	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2449	He is so good at it he has never stopped campaigning to be president.
9708	Dan40	shaker154	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2449	Its a shame that he is so bad at being the president.
9709	onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	You have mistaken me for a Bush fan.
9710	onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	I voted for him, but realized that he had problems of his own.
9711	onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	I couldn't wait for him to be out of office by the end of his second term.Obama is accelerating the decline of our country.
9712	onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	The only thing slowing him down, is the Republican controlled House.
9713	onalandline	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2450	Luckily, he couldn't even get all that he wanted passed when the Dems controlled everything.Now who's in fairytale land and lying to everyone around them?
9714	onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2451	Where?
9715	onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2451	All I have seen is an ever-increasing bureaucracy in Washington.
9716	onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2451	The Public sector, unfortunately, is where the growth is. The economy is stagnating, jobs are not being created like you think, and the unemployment rate is still dismal.
9717	onalandline	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2451	I have serious doubts as to whether or not the stimulus did anything except to increase our deficits.
9718	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2452	You seem to be ignoring a few key facts.
9719	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2452	After Bush wrecked the economy revenue drastically increased, and Obama has also needed to spend a lot to stimulate the wrecked economy, so the direct comparisions to Bush are intellectually dishonest.Bush had no excuse for what he did.
9720	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2452	Tax cuts for the rich and 2 unneccessary wars are what blew up the deficit.
9721	Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	The republicans are slowing him down?
9722	Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	Hilarious.
9723	Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	Which party held unemployment benefits hostage so the bush tax cuts could be extended and blew another 800 billion hole in the deficit?
9724	Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	Republicans.They are the ones trying to destroy this country, which they did for 8 years but now they really want to finish it off because an Obama failure, is the only way to fool the sheep into voting them back into power.Which party ensured the financial reform bill was as weak as (*)(*)(*)(*) and ineffective?
9725	Tarrant	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2453	Again the republicans, and the result will be another crash.
9726	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Whine out obamalama excuses all you wish, but as bad as Bush was, the incompetent clown obamalama is worse.
9727	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	MUCH WORSE.
9728	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Comparing Bush and the clown is comparing dumb and dumberer.
9729	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	The seeds of the destruction of the economy were planted long before Bush showed up.
9730	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Bush was ineffective in stopping those seeds from sprouting.
9731	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	And the clown obamalama is even worse at correcting the economy.
9732	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	But that is not his fault.
9733	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	He is a politician and it is politicians that caused to economy to be set up to collapse over some decades.
9734	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	So while NOT fixing the economy is not obamalama's fault.
9735	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Running up enormous debt in the process IS his fault.THERE is no arguing or excusing the debt numbers.
9736	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	Bush increased the debt by $4.350 trillion over 8 years.

9738	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	And since the end of Bush's last full fiscal year, the debt has increased by another $4.2 trillion.
9739	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	So in this SHORT time the incompetent clown fool obamalama, has increased the debt by nearly as much as Bush did in 8 years.
9740	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	And for a kicker the clown fool has just submitted a budget that he LIES and says it will reduce deficits by $400.
9741	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2454	billion while the debt will increase by $7 TRILLION.We can file the fool obamalama under the heading, &quot;Be Careful What You Wish For!&quot;
9742	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2455	The economy is not stagnating, it's growing.
9743	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2455	About 3% real last year.
9744	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2455	A big improvement over the -7% decline in early 2009.You may have serious doubts, but the economic data showing a turnaround in the economy and the fact that the CBO has calculated the stimulus saved or created millions of jobs is not a matter of belief, but a matter of record.You can find the data on economic growth at: BEA.govYou can find the data on unemployment at: http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htmYou can see stock market performance here: http://www.google.com/finance?client...DEXDJX:grin:JIYou can see CBO reports on the stimulus here: http://www.cbo.gov/publications/coll...cfm?collect=12
9745	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2456	So your actually denying that in a recession , goverment revenue drops drastically?, and that in a recession it is vital for the goverment to spend to stimulate the economy?
9746	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2456	You are disagreement with basic economic fundamentals im afraid.
9747	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2457	Bush inherited a budget surplus and squandered it, running up $5 trillion more debt.Obama inherited a great recession and most of the debt he has incurred is because of that.Whether he can preside over a meaningful deficit reduction with the House in control of Republicans who refuse to consider increasing revenues will remain to be seen.
9748	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2457	But I have always been critical of Obama's relatively lax attitude toward the budget (though he was the only president in decades to actually reduce spending last year).
9749	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2457	It was a reason I supported Clinton.
9750	Iriemon	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2457	Unfortunately, McCain gave no reasonable alternative.
9751	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	To which of the 50 or so &quot;basic economic fundamentals&quot; do you refer?
9752	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	Not that it matters since every one is &quot;theoretical.&quot;Prior to this economic downturn, the one where we spent the most government money, took from 1929 until 1946 and a World War to correct.
9753	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	Other times government has lowered taxes and got out of the way of the private sector to allow the economy to recover on its own, and it has.And here is a &quot;basic economic truth&quot; for you.
9754	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	This present recession is 100% the fault of long term meddling in business by politicians of both parties.
9755	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2458	Politicians, no matter what label they attach to themselves caused the housing, financial and securities troubles with laws they have passed and laws they repealed.To look to politicians to correct the problem that they ignore they created is the height, or depth, of folly.
9756	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2459	Just out today for you:US manufacturing activity hits 2004 highWASHINGTON &#8212; US manufacturing grew for the 19th straight month in February as a jump in employment and production drove activity to a nearly six-year high, a key industry survey showed Tuesday.Employment also rose 2.8 percentage points, to 64.5 percent, climbing above 60 percent &quot;for only the third time in the last decade,&quot; Ore said.http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp...01ac4be9a7.45119 months ago it was July 2009, about 3-4 months after the stimulus passed.
9757	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2459	Mere coincidence?
9758	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2459	Our conservative friends would have you believe that.
9759	Iriemon	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2459	The bi-partisan CBO says otherwise.
9760	JTFREEBIRD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2461	I will not be voting for this idiot Obama.
9761	JTFREEBIRD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2461	And for the Dems to be up in arms over what's going on in Wisconsin is fairly hypocritical after all the things he and Pelosi shoved down the American peoples throats!
9762	JTFREEBIRD	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2461	I am betting we get a Newt Gingrich/Allen West ticket elected in 2012!
9763	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	The ones I directly referred to in my post.
9764	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	Revenue dropping in a recession is not theoretical, its established basic fact.
9765	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	Not sure why your debating economics when you dont even understand the basics.
9766	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	When you say 'meddling' I hope you are referring to the deregulation that allowed the financial sector to run wild and eventually impode.
9767	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	Its a direct result of not enough goverment meddling or regulation.
9768	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2462	that caused the problem, and the republicans have ensured, the problem remains not fixed, although its almost certain that Obama also never wanted it fixed himself becauuse that would upset his corporate masters.
9769	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	I am certain that I understand economics far better than you.
9770	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	Yes Government revenue is very likely to drop in a recession.
9771	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	But the revenue did not drop by $4 trillion dollars.
9772	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And Govt spending is but one possible way to help in a recession.
9773	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And it is possibly the worst way, as every dollar the Government spends is a dollar taken out of the economy, since the economy IS the source of the govt money.
9774	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	The so called deregulation was the repeal of long standing effective regs for new regs of political expediency.
9775	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And you can forget about Republicans taking the blame.
9776	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And I AM NOT a Republican, and never have been a registered Republican, but once was a registered Democrat.
9777	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	BOTH parties caused our present day problems.
9778	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	Not with deregulation but with exchanging good regulations for bad regulations.
9779	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	Some wise and well considered regulation is necessary.
9780	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	But creating Securities out of sub-prime loans is not good regulation.
9781	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	Nor is passing laws that led to the creation of sub-prime loans.And the new financial regulations are a hastily slapped together mish-mash of ill considered political posturing that will cause more problems than they solve.
9782	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2463	And will cost the public untold millions of dollars in unnecessary bureaucratic fees.And those &quot;corporate masters&quot; certainly should be Flogged on an hourly basis.Look what they do to us.Provide essentially all of the nations jobs.Pay the bulk of our taxes.Provide every good, product, and service you desire.You should skip trying to talk economics when YOU haven't the first shred of a clue what economics are about.
9783	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Goverment spending goes back into the economy, its not taking out, and if its directed properly it has the best stimulus multiplier.
9784	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Unemployment benefits for example is maybe the highest multiplier because its spent so quickly and so many different industries profit from it.
9785	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	What in ur opinion is a better way to stimulate demand in the economy, other than directly creating jobs programs or giving money to the people to spend?
9786	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Let me guess, tax cuts?
9787	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	They sure helped the economy in the last decade didnt they?
9788	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	lol.
9789	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	In other words deregulation, as reducing restrictions and control of what the financial industry can do.
9790	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Its ok you can say the word.
9791	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	Again thats all called deregulation, and I agree both sides are to blame.
9792	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	No they dont, not the richest few percent.
9793	Tarrant	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2464	They play a strong factor in all these areas though but that does not justify them bribing and corrupting the political system and exploiting the country.
9794	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2466	de·reg·u·late (d-rgy-lt)tr.v. de·reg·u·lat·ed, de·reg·u·lat·ing, de·reg·u·latesTo free from regulation, especially to remove government regulations from:If it was the right word I would not hesitate to use it.
9795	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2466	But replacing a good regulation with a bad one is still regulation, not deregulation.The politicians did not create a situation where &quot;anything goes!&quot; They created one where it was regulated to &quot;only ridiculous nonsense that cannot possibly last, goes!&quot;Politicians cannot conceive of the idea of actual DEregulation.
9796	Dan40	Tarrant	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2466	To a politician, every thing must be regulated to their own best advantage.The media misuses the word deregulation, and many others, often.
9797	RevAnarchist	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2467	If Obama would have produced the real change he promised he would not be so detested even by his prior supporters.
9798	RevAnarchist	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2467	This country does need real change.

9800	RevAnarchist	LittleLiberty	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2467	I expected as much from bush etc but not Obama.ra

9842	RevAnarchist	jthorp24	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2478	And maybe that's true, but it has nothing to do with racism but everything to do with an unfair societies and world governments that are led by greed and the love of money.As long as that situation continues our fate is grimly predictable IMO.

9853	Dan40	taxmule	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2484	Or do I vote for the incompetent obamalama knowing that he is not able to do the job?I'd have to go with the unknown quantity rather than the known failure, obamalama..After 12 years of GWB and BHO, isn't it time somebody capable runs for President.

9978	RevAnarchist	OneThunder	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2521	There is a big difference.&#8220;Isolationism isn't what I advocate,&#8217;&#8217; Paul told Blitzer.

9988	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2525	My religion based paradigm is simplistic but accurate/true.

9991	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2525	So we must look at the tree as a whole and not try to take it apart.

9993	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2525	Anyway there is nothing complex about our failures, every one of them can be traced back to Greed and the love of money, just as a great man/God once said about 2000 years ago.
9994	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2525	* Open Christian theism can best be described as liberal Christianity.
9995	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2525	We still must validate our beliefs by scripture but non traditional answers and such are accepted and studied where in an ordinary seminary or church those ideas would be summarily rejected.

10203	Sassy	oldjar07	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2565	because candidates are no longer under pressure to &quot;reward&quot; those who donate to get the candidate elected.Another improvement would be to redistrict the country according to the Constitution, not limit the number to 435 districts; begin nonpartisan redistricting according to population alone, not by political party; get rid of the electoral college; return the office of President and V.P. to be voted on separately so that the candidate with the most votes becomes President and the next highest vote getter becomes V.P.

10211	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	The teabaggers gained power in the southwest and southern Republican party (democrats until LBJ passed the civil rights act); from religious conservative Democrats (blue dogs) in the midwest; and Fox News who has become a doggerel political party using so called public owned airways.
10212	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2566	Thanks to union buster Ronald Reagan, the once powerful labor unions that literally &quot;made&quot; the middle class after WWII have lost PAC power; and Reagan's tax aversion to ALL public education initiatives for American children, the quality of educated young people in America has deteriorated dramatically.

10220	Sassy	Metal Head	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2567	That means he offends both those who are strongly liberal and conservative, but it doesn't follow that what he's doing or has done is wrong.
10221	Sassy	Metal Head	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2567	When Bush was at this same period in his Presidency, he had moved the USA into 2 wars, one of which after 10 years we now know was based on a blatant lie; the other he called a &quot;war&quot; any reasonable person would say we can't win now or ever.
10222	Sassy	Metal Head	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2567	Yet, Bush was elected to a 2nd term.

10241	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	So I was not unhappy to see the rise of the tea party and their power.
10242	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	However, I know very little about the detailed inner workings of the tea party.
10243	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	I do know MSNBC hates them and FOX loves them,ha ha that's a fairly good endorsement as far as I am concerned!
10244	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	That said I will also tell you I am no great fan of FOX but I do SO detest MSNBC!
10245	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	They are a violent group masquerading as do gooders when they are just as mean and hateful as what they imagine the awful gun toting right wingers are!
10246	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Ok why do you think the tea party is radical?

10248	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Are they as radical as say the Taliban who uses murder and terror to accomplish their goals?
10249	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	You make serious claims so you should have serious proof of this violence and that its instigated and approved of by the chairman of the tea party.

10256	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	I think that the liberals are simply jealous and fearful that FOX is so popular!
10257	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	They are uber terrified that they are in the extreme minority.
10258	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	They do not blame themselves, but rather they blame popular talk shows like Rush Borze Savage Beck FOX etc. as being leaders of an right wing conspiracy or something!
10259	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	How stupid is that?
10260	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Sorry, that the popularity of the right wing is where the advertising money is! If the fringe leftist view was popular FOX would be courting the left!
10261	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Its that easy eh?
10262	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Again I am not especially enamored with FOX, they like every other capitalistic endeavor.
10263	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	They are in business to make money first, sometimes at the expense of the truth, hence the FOXs and the Becks and the Rushes.
10264	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	We live in a semi free country and if the majority of the people beleive and want to hear far right talk and are willing to spend money to see it then by god that's whats going to be on TV!
10265	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Its far more a money thing than a political thing.
10266	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	I think the leftist liberal airheads are in denial and can not beleive that maybe 80% of the population are more like FOX viewers than like themselves.
10267	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	The only good thing the unions did is raise the wage in the early 1900s.
10268	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	The trouble is they did not know where to stop and ended up killing the goose that laid their golden eggs.
10269	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	I am not pro union but not anti union either.
10270	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	The guns carried to those rallies appear to me to be a symbol (look it up it may be a bit of a stretch).
10271	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	If it strikes fear in those that know next to nothing about our history or even human nature so be it.
10272	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2573	Fear is a good motivator.

10322	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	He's such a fraud trying to emulate a &quot;professor&quot; when he has neither the education nor the intellect.
10323	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	I'd love to see him go up against someone like Christopher Hitchens who would blow him out of the studio both with humor and &quot;facts;&quot; something Beck doesn't recognize unless he invented them.
10324	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	What are you then?

10326	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Seems to me that someone who lives in Appalachia, would be very pro-union because of the inhuman conditions miners endure in the coal mines.
10327	Sassy	RevAnarchist	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2580	Or, are you an advocate for black lung disease, a preexisting condition that insurance carriers refuse to qualify for treatment?

10345	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Confession?
10346	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I said the same things (and more) in my introduction.
10347	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	So I do not waver in my values.
10348	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am the same when I introed' as I am now, you only had to look at my introduction...
10349	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	No, you lied, I never said I hate nor detest the people there.
10350	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	That&#8217;s NOT ok! your pathetic attempts at character assassination are blatantly obvious, and pathetic.
10351	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Not only that if you must lie to get a point across its not a point worth making, eh?
10352	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	BTW, in my intro I said this; &#8220;Hi to all.
10353	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am a somewhat (non-traditional) conservative leaning semi anarchist type person that is suspicious of a overly large and bloated federal government.&quot; So I do not waver in what I say.
10354	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am a non traditional gun toting ( I carry a .45 with an extended magazine, and a .38, sometimes I also carry a .12 gauge riot shotgun if I am emptying cash vaults at my machines, usually in the early AM).
10355	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Not at all!
10356	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Your inaccurate and simple comments are common rhetoric and propaganda used by those that hate Christians and Christianity.
10357	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	The personalities of those types of people can be mildly violent to dangerous psychopaths, that are capable of harming others.
10358	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	With all due respect, I am not saying you are one of those type individuals, but your hateful comments about the tea party which is heavily Christian and other conservative groups are nearly identical.
10359	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I am not a tea party person nor member, but maybe you can tell me or better yet a moderator what you meant by that phrase ie an 'tea bag?'
10360	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	All talk and no proof.
10361	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Every time?
10362	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I can claim many things but backing it up with proof is not so easy, especially when 90% of it is a lie.
10363	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Your credibility is zero with me because you are fond of making claims without an shred of proof.
10364	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	From what I have seen much of the tea party people are normal people, unless the footage is shot by a mike moore or a MSNBC type.
10365	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I backed you in a corner because I knew you can&#8217;t prove nearly anything you say!
10366	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	And I knew you would lose it and show your true colors (as in above).
10367	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I just wanted everyone else to see the real you!
10368	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	In any case your rants are always the same prattle as above.
10369	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	An hysterical rant by a beaten (politically) foe.
10370	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	If you think the last elections were bad wait until 2012!
10371	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	Yessssss you are!
10372	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I think morally, as in traditional christian value, FOX viewers are the core of America.
10373	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	They are what built America and what will sustain it when the girlie men run away when the going gets tough.
10374	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	So IMO, they are the highest denominator and the best people in America.
10375	RevAnarchist	Sassy	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2591	I don't watch TV news because its mostly entertainment not news.

10405	Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	But I KNOW that the obamalama is a worse president than Nixon, Carter and Bush.
10406	Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	[combined or separately] Therefore I have no worry that Palin could possibly be worse than the incompetent clown obamalama.
10407	Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	I would hate to see her elected, but would much rather she than he.obamalama is the worst president in modern times, maybe the worst EVER.
10408	Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	Each day I get more of a feeling that ANYONE else has an excellent chance of being better.
10409	Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	Look at what the idiot clown has done while holding reelection foremost in his plans.
10410	Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	Reelection is his only restraint and yet he has blown over $4 trillion dollars in 2 years.
10411	Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	He will surpass Bush's total debt increase IN THIS FISCAL YEAR!!!!.
10412	Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	Less than 3 years compared to 8 years.
10413	Dan40	Daggdag	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2596	It is beyond scary what he will attempt to do if reelected and is a lame duck with no more campaigning to do and no higher office to seek..

10532	liberalminority	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2641	would have to disagree, no political candidate can be against the interests of all corporations because that is where the money is...also populist is subjective since the US has a big conservative christian base who finds homosexual rights, stem cell research, abortions, etc...all to be immoral.
10533	liberalminority	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2641	americans should vote for President Obama because he picks the good corporations as winners and makes the bad corporations into losers by paying more taxes for socialist initiatives, this is seen in the domestic drilling ban for the bad oil corporations and the tax breaks for the good corporations like GE for investing in clean energy...a republican candidate would allow the oil companies to drill for oil causing wars and pollution and not redistribute wealth from the rich and bad corporations to the middle class, President Obama is a hybrid of socialist and corporatist and that is better than a republican who is a capitalist and corporatist.
10534	Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	Uh, right, more like the fact that Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of GE, is one of Obama's top campaign contributors.
10535	Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	The man whom Obama appointed to the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, and to serve as chairman of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, while GE pays no taxes on its massive profits.
10536	Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	Obama is doing everything you say &quot;a republican candidate&quot; would do.
10537	Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	It is Obama who has been pushing for more drilling in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico.
10538	Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	It is Obama who has launched illegal wars in Libya, Yemen, and Pakistan, while escalating Afghanistan and lying about ever withdrawing from Iraq.
10539	Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	It is Obama who has pushed hard to protect tax breaks for the rich, and has been obsessed since the day he got into office with cutting Social Security and Medicare.Obama has not a single socialist impulse.
10540	Come Home America	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2642	He is a hardcore right-wing neoliberal capitalist whose idol is Ronald Reagan.
10541	Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	You make a good point in highlighting that populism can be subjective...however, I think you know what I really meant by the use of the term: I was referring to one being a standard leftist populist, not a rightist populist (like the Tea Party movement).You are also correct to point out that not all commercial interests are equally hostile to the broader public interest.
10542	Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	But still, I was going beyond that.
10543	Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	I was saying that he is not only supported by liberal capitalists, but also has genuine loyalties to the ordinary population.
10544	Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	(i.e. That he is at least a part-time populist.)
10545	Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	He isn't a slam dunk on either side of that equation.
10546	Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	He can be pressured into leaning toward either side.I of course wasn't trying to say that Obama is &quot;against the interests of all corporations&quot;.
10547	Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	Frankly, I have no idea how you got that that interpretation of my post.
10548	Polly Minx	liberalminority	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2643	I just meant that he is not strictly, or even necessarily principally, beholden to commercial interests of any sort.
10549	Joe Six-pack	rstones199	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2644	Me too, unless Ron Paul gets the GOP nom.
10550	9/11 was an inside job	Joe Six-pack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2645	anybody who votes for any other candidate other than ron paul is a fool especially the 192 people that have said they will vote for obama again.guess they must all be black people.Many blacks dont sem to care that he has continued everything Bush got started and lied about everything he said he was going to do and has expanded and accelerated the recession.Guess all those 192 Obama lovers love it that he is taking us down towards nazi germany same as Bush,Clinton,congress and all those other candidates that do not believe in the constitution.
10551	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	That's the question that popped into my head vis-à-vis you when I read that bizarre claim that Wall Street's man Obama is some kind of &quot;populist&quot;.
10552	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama's economic policies are the same as Bush's.
10553	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	&quot;Stimulus packages&quot; which are smoke and mirrors, consisting largely of kickbacks and &quot;tax cuts&quot; which don't produce a single job.
10554	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama has done nothing to address any fundamental problems with the U.S. economy.
10555	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	He did not re-instate any serious financial regulation, like the Glass-Steagall Act, which was repealed under the last right-wing Democratic president.
10556	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	He has done nothing to address any of the flawed &quot;free trade&quot; agreements which have driven out jobs and lowered standards...also signed by Clinton.
10557	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Rather he is instead pushing for new ones like KORUS, so American jobs can now be sent to North Korea too.He has done nothing to address the soaring costs of healthcare weighing on America's economy, taking single-payer off the table before the whole fake &quot;debate&quot; over his DoleRomneyCare bill even began.
10558	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama has accepted the Tea Party consensus that there is a &quot;debt crisis&quot; going on, and that programs like Medicare and Social Security are to blame for it.
10559	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	He has accepted the idea that we need massive spending cuts even though we are in the middle of a depression and unemployment is already soaring.
10560	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Meanwhile he has repeatedly made &quot;deals&quot; violating his own promise to even let the Bush tax cuts expire, never mind the idea of actually making serious reforms to the tax code so the rich might pay their fair share.On the whole, Obama doesn't really represent any major shifts from the neoliberal economic policies that have characterized the past 30 years.
10561	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	If anything, he is more effective than Reagan and Bush at actually getting once-sacrosanct Democratic programs like Social Security onto the chopping block.
10562	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama is black.

10564	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama has doubled the number of troops in Afghanistan.
10565	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	We don't even know how many thousands of private contractors are on the ground in Iraq.
10566	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Never mind a pacifist, I don't see how anyone with a moral compass could possibly find anything to be happy about with the current warmonger-in-chief's policies.
10567	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Obama has doubled down on Bush's radical neocon &quot;war on terror&quot; policies, both foreign and domestic.
10568	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	Well, I wasn't getting into the specifics of Obama's illegal war on Libya.
10569	Come Home America	Polly Minx	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2646	I was simply making reference to Obama's overall continuation of neoconservative foreign policy, just as he has continued neoliberal economic policy.

10571	rstones199	Joe Six-pack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2649	I would vote for Ron Paul.

10576	Iriemon	dixiehunter	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2655	Can he be impeached after he's already left office?
10577	EddyIsHere	onalandline	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2656	Half of these are just flat out lies...At least he doesn't say giving Snooki and Charlie Sheen tax cuts will create jobs...
10578	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	He has not kept most of his campaign promises.He has not been transparent.He has/will raise taxes on everyone (no tax cut for 95% of Americans).He has increased spending/size of government to record levels.He has /will increase our deficit to record levels.He ignores The People and pushes through legislation any way he can.He has weakened national security/border security.He has several proposed policies that will hurt Americans and our economy.He is shunning our allies and kissing the asses of our enemies.He continues to spew lies and BS to the American people.Every one of the above is trueHe has kept less than 200 of over 500 promises.
10579	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	That is not saying he has broken the rest, just has not kept them.Even liberals could not possibly claim there has been ANYTHING transparent about odrama's back room deals.He has VOWED that the tax cuts will expire in Dec 2012.
10580	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	That will increase the taxes on the rich by $70 billion and increase the taxes on everyone else by $300 billion per year.He already has increased spending and government size and deficits to record levels.
10581	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	He has never had a deficit below $1,293.5 TRILLION.
10582	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	No other president EVER had a deficit as high as $500 billion.He pushed obamacare through with threats and bribes to his own party and when passed and still today, the majority of the American People are against obamacare.Selling automatic weapons to criminals across our border is NOT the way to increase border security.His Stimulus bill cost the nation a TRILLION dollars we don't have.
10583	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	And today our unemployment rate is higher than when the bill was passed which means by simple arithmetic, that there are fewer jobs now than when the bill was passed.
10584	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	Regardless of his lying claims.And the last two are obvious to anyone alive.And resisting tax increases that would not solve any problem [raising a mere $70 billion per year, MAYBE] and might cause more problems, is NOT asking for tax cuts for Snooki and Charlie Sheen.One other point about tax breaks.
10585	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	odrama is currently harping about special tax breaks for &quot;corporate jets.&quot; Do you know where those special tax breaks came from???
10586	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	odrama's Stimulus bill,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Did you know that the debt commission that odrama formed, that he hand-picked, to study ways to reduce our deficits and debt, RECOMMENDED that tax rates be LOWERED?
10587	Dan40	EddyIsHere	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2658	Think that might be why odrama IGNORED their report after they gave it to him last Dec.?
10588	tomteapack	Joe Six-pack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2659	I will have to vote for Obama, anyone that ALL the parties are mad at, must be doing something right.

10622	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2675	And as an employers fund is drawn down, his payments to replenish his 'bank' go UP.
10623	Dan40	Iriemon	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2675	And those premiums go up permanently.

10702	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2711	Are Blacks and Hispanics predominate at tea party rallies?
10703	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2711	No they are not but neither are they predominate in US society.
10704	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2711	But Asians show up far out of proportion to society.
10705	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2711	And Asians tend to be good money managers, which would explain why they are also unhappy with Washington.There cannot be any justification for running up a deficit far exceeding a TRILLION dollars EVERY year when, 1.
10706	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2711	revenue is down only $394.5 billion, or less than a third of the deficits being insanely posted.

10708	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2711	No one ever had to have a deficit of even $500 billion before Democrats took over.

10710	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2711	Now they routinely have deficits more than a TRILLION above the previous record by Republicans.
10711	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2711	And the Republicans are terrible money managers too.
10712	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2711	It is ONLY in comparison to the ultra insane spending Democrats that the Republicans look 'reasonable.'

10724	tomteapack	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2717	And never forget that this current deficit has been on a steady rise - with every president (except Clinton) since the great and wonderful Reagan Lowered the taxes to a foolish low level, and since then they have even dropped more and more.
10725	tomteapack	Dan40	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2717	If the taxes were half what they were during the time of Reagan there would be no deficit.

10729	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	FY 2007 the deficit was $161 billion.FY 2006 the deficit was higher than FY 2007,FY 2005 the deficit was higher than FY 2006,In others words the deficit was diminishing for 3 years in a row.
10730	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	NOT increasingNow FY 2007 the FEDERAL revenue was $2,568 trillion and we spent $161 billion more than that or $2,729 TRILLION.
10731	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	That can in no way be interpreted as GOOD.However AS OF YESTERDAY, with 41 days left in FY 2011, Our Federal income projects to be $2,483 TRILLION.

10733	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	But our deficit projects to be $1,600 TRILLION.
10734	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	So we're short $85 billion in income and we've increased the deficit by a factor of 10.We had the same 2 wars going on and we had the tax cuts in FY 2007.
10735	Dan40	tomteapack	http://www.politicalforum.com/elections-campaigns/125257-will-you-vote-obama-2012-a.html	2720	How do you justify a deficit increasing TENFOLD on nearly the same income?
